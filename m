I didn't want to shoot down the idea, since it seemed like somebody had =
a plan
with GSoC. But I actually agree, that I'm not quite convinced.

I think I'd need to see some data that showed the Python version is =
inadequate.
I know Python is not the fastest, but is it so prohibitively slow, that =
we
cannot make the TCG analysis? I'm not saying it can't be true, but it'd =
be nice
to see it demonstrated before making decisions.

Because, as you point out, there's a lot of downsides to having two =
versions. So
the benefits have to clearly outweigh the additional work.

I have a lot of other questions, but let's maybe start with the core =
idea first.
