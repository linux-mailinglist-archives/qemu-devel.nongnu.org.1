I think the reason is just that we didn't understand how much
of a performance hit the architected algorithm for pointer auth
is in emulation. So we took our default approach of "implement
what the architecture says". Then later when we realised how
bad the effect was we added in a faster impdef authentication
algorithm, but we put it in as not-the-default because of our
usual bias towards "don't change existing behaviour".

The point here about "breaking migration" is that we have a strong
set of rules:
 * if you say "-machine virt-8.2" you get "exactly the behaviour
   that the 'virt' machine type had in QEMU 8.2, and it is
   migration compatible
 * we can make changes that are not migration compatible only if we
   ensure that they are not applied to older versioned machine types
   (or if they're to devices that are only used in machines which
   do not have versioned machine types at all)
 * TCG '-cpu max' is a special case: it is not a fixed thing, and so
   it may acquire new non-migration-compatible changes between versions
   (and so if you care about VM migration compat you don't use it);
   but this is not true of the named CPU types that match real
   hardware implementations

This patch as it stands will not preserve the migration
guarantees that we make. So we need to fix it by either:
 * only making the default change on -cpu max
 * making the default change be bound to versioned types

As I say, I don't have a strong view on which of these we go for
(and I'm actually kind of leaning to the second, given the discussion).

The machinery for how this works means that you only need to
put the property in the appropriate hw_compat array for the
machine version before where it was introduced. The 'virt-9.2'
machine type applies the properties listed in hw_compat_9_2
(you can think of the properties listed there as having the
meaning "downgrade the default behaviour back to what it was
in 9.2 and earlier".) The virt-9.1 machine type applies the
properties listed in hw_compat_9_1 and hw_compat_9_2. The
virt-9.0 machine type applies the properties listed in hw_compat_9_0,
_9_1 and _9_2.

This is all implemented by the boilerplate DEFINE_VIRT_MACHINE() and
virt_machine_*_options functions at the bottom of hw/arm/virt.c
(plus the common code that invokes). We have to carry all this
machinery around anyway to handle other migration-breaking changes
in other parts of QEMU, so it's pretty free to add another property
like backcompat-cntfrq here.

The very oldest versioned machine types are deprecated after
3 years and dropped after another 3 years, so eventually the
older hw_compat arrays will go away.

The guest can look at the value that the pointer auth instruction
produces if it likes, so it can certainly tell whether there's
a difference. But the only reason to do that is in test code
that's checking that the pauth instructions do what they're
supposed to do. Architecturally because multiple authentication
options are permitted no well behaved guest is going to depend
on which one exactly is being used.

As I say, I do think it would be good to check whether our
current implementation is "default to qarma5 everywhere", or
whether it is "default to what the real CPU says it has in its
ID registers". If we are already defaulting to something that's
not what the real implementation does it's another piece of
evidence on the side of "we can just default to a different
not-matching-the-hardware choice".
