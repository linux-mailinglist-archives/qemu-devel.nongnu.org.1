I guess I'm not seeing how libc is blocking us in this respect ?
The clone() syscall wrapper is exposed by glibc at least, and it
is possible to call it, albeit with some caveats that we might
miss any logic glibc has around its fork() wrapper. The spec
requires that any child must immediately call execve after vfrok
so I'm wondering just what risk of confusion we would have in
practice ?

That would get the synchronization behaviour of Linux vfork,
but I'm not sure it'd get the performance benefits (of avoiding
page table copying) which is what  Andreas mentioned as the
desired thing ?
