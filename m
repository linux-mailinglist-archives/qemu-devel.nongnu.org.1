[Resending to include qemu-devel and add numbers to the patches]

This patch set gives an implementation of "RISC-V Core-Local Interrupt
Controller(CLIC) Version 0.9-draft-20210217". It comes from [1], where
you can find the pdf format or the source code.

This is based on the implementation from 2021 by Liu Zhiwei [3], who took
over the job from Michael Clark, who gave the first implementation of
clic-v0.7 specification [2]. I believe this implementation addresses all
the comments in Liu Zhiwei's RFC patch thread.

This implementation follows the CLIC 0.9-stable draft at 14 March 2024,
with the following exceptions and implementation details:
 - the CLIC control registers are memory-mapped as per earlier drafts (in
   particular version 0.9-draft, 20 June 2023)
 - the indirect CSR control in 0.9-stable is not implemented
 - the vector table can be either handler addresses (as per the spec)
   or a jump table where each entry is processed as an instruction,
   selectable with version number v0.9-jmp
 - each hart is assigned its own CLIC block
 - if PRV_S and/or PRV_M are supported, they are currently assumed to follo=
w
   the PRV_M registers; a subsequent update will address this
 - support for PRV_S and PRV_M is selectable at CLIC instantiation
 - PRV_S and PRV_U registers are currently separate from PRV_M; a subsequen=
t
   update will turn them into filtered views onto the PRV_M registers
 - each hart is assigned its own CLIC block
 - support for PRV_S and PRV_M is selectable at CLIC instantiation by
   passing in a base address for the given modes; a base address of 0 is
   treated as not supported
 - PRV_S and PRV_U registers are mapped  onto the PRV_M controls with
   appropriate filtering for the access mode
 - the RISCV virt machine has been updated to allow CLIC emulation by
   passing "machine=3Dvirt,clic=3Don" on the command line; various other
   parameters have been added to allow finer control of the CLIC behavior

The implementation (in jump-table mode) has been verified to match the
Cirrus Logic silicon (PRV_M only), which is based upon the Pulp
implementation [4] as of June 2023.

The implementation also includes a selection of qtests designed to verify
operation in all possible combinations of PRV_M, PRV_S and PRV_U.
