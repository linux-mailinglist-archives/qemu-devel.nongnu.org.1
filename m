This sounds like a hell of alot of busy work to fix a problem that, IIUC,
does not actually exist from a functional POV - it is merely a perception
issue that people might be put off by the "Intel 6300ESB" names.

IMHO a better use of time is to expand documentation to clarify this is
just fine for all PCI architectures, and change nothing in either QEMU
or guest kernels.

With regards,
Daniel
