Actually that's exactly what I think is right.. it looks to me now that we
could bypass anything in MultifdOps (including recv()) but let device state
be a parallel layer of MultifdOps itself, leaving MultifdOps only for
compressors.

And yeah, I still remember you just renamed it from recv_pages() to
recv()..  it's just that now when think it again it looks like cleaner to
make it only about pages..

Yes it should be separate.

And what I meant is we don't need all these noops, but recv() keeps being
ignored just like above, then for sender side, right now it's:

            ret = multifd_send_state->ops->send_prepare(p, &local_err);
            if (migrate_mapped_ram()) {
                file_write_ramblock_iov();
            } else {
                ret = qio_channel_writev_full_all();
            }

VFIO can process device state in parallel, so:

    if (ram) {
        ret = multifd_send_state->ops->send_prepare(p, &local_err);
        if (migrate_mapped_ram()) {
                file_write_ramblock_iov();
        } else {
                qio_channel_writev_full_all();
        }
    } else {
        // device state handling
        multifd_send_device_prepare(...);
        ...
        qio_channel_writev_full_all();
    }

Then MultifdOps doesn't apply to device states.
