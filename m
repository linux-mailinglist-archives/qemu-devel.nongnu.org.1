I apologize for my slow response, and thanks a lot for the long writeup.

Actually, even until now I still didn't get enough time to finish my own
investigation regarding to at least the hotplug issues I mentioned below,
but let me reply first on my current thoughts.

I didn't see any warning/error running it, with --enable-asan.  I
definitely missed something, please let me know if you have idea.

My gut feeling is CPU hotplugs logic should make sure proper eliminations
of all these objects, that should include the address space destructions.

To me, the address space may or may not even have an owner.  It's unlike
MR, that either will not be freed if owner==NULL, or must have an owner.
Hence address spaces are at least not as special as MRs, who constantly do
refcounts against owner before your this patch.

AFAIU, when arch would care about any form of memory leaks in the CPU
object / address spaces, the arch should follow the trend of the major
archs that support hotplugs. I had a vague memory that at least i386 should
support CPU hotplugs properly.

From that, I saw we do have cpu_address_space_init(), that i386 and arm
use. There, AddressSpace is not embeded in the CPU object, instead we have
these relevant fields in CPUState:

    struct CPUAddressSpace *cpu_ases;
    int cpu_ases_count;
    AddressSpace *as;

That looks like a more advanced way of allowing >1 address spaces for a
CPU, however one arch can still opt-in with 1 address space, setting
num_ases=1, and pass in asidx=0.  After all, all these are fields of
CPUState that all CPU objects share, including xtensa's.

Should xtensa (when starts to care about CPU hotplugs and relevant memleaks
like what we're discussing now) move to the generic way of managing address
spaces like what x86 and arm do (rather than relying on its)? Then maybe we
should always be able to properly destroy the address spaces?

How important is such leak in xtensa CPU's case?  E.g. does it support
CPU hotplugs?

Side note: when I was trying to test hotplugs with i386/q35, unfortunately
I didn't really see when the address space was destroyed, maybe there's a
bug somewhere; I put that info into appendix at the end.

Anyway, my confusion is if we should manage address spaces in the same way
across important archs, and if that would after all always involve proper
address space destructions.

OTOH, I also see things like tcg handling in cpu_address_space_init().  I'm
not sure if it means tcg_log_global_after_sync() / tcg_commit() might be
useful for xtensa tcg cpus too.  So there might be other reasons too that
xtensa cpus should move over to a generic CPU plug/unplug API, which will
cover the address spaces management?

Take my above as pure asks, not review comments.  After all, I don't know
the problem well, once more.

It doesn't look like exactly the problem, or I definitely could have missed
something.  After all, flatview_translate() is protected by rcu, afaiu, not
refcounts, right?  Maybe you meant something like address_space_map()?

That'll definitely need to hold the MR longer after rcu_read_unlock(),
however then could you explain if it happens, why the paired unmap() won't
happen to properly release it?

Please bare with me on my ignorance on Rust.  Do you mean it might be
important to Rust, and this could be proposed separately copying whoever is
active on Rust?

It sounds like a better way to justify the first patch landing before the
rest, if it is acceptable whoever is fluent with QEMU/Rust.

My stupid question is, why a ref() to self could happen in a finalize(),
and why it's legal at all, causing double finalize? It sounds against the
whole idea refcounting. But as I know zero on Rust, feel free to ignore my
question if you think that's a well known problem by all others.  Then I
also suggest you send patch 1 separately.

We could, but then MR object will behave totally differently when it's
allocated by object_new(), or when it's not.  Meanwhile, if we want to in
the future use more object_new(TYPE_MEMORY_REGION) we may also want to
reuse memory_region_do_init() on top of them, then that'll be a problem and
even if it's not a blocker it's hard to track all these design trivial
differences.

I confess I can only get your gut of your new design, however I personally
don't prefer reusing a free() function that does anything without memory
releases.  It is really error-prone to me for the long term.  That's also
the root cause of why it cannot be used mixture with object_new() because
that was the much-easy-to-understand way to properly set a object->free()..

Another thing is, after your new design, MRs (even fully embeded in a
Device object) will start to have real refcountings, concurrently from the
Device object.

And then, if we think about an Device object with N MR objects embeded, the
struct has N+1 refcounts... Totally confusing to me.  I think that's where
I mentioned I liked the piggypack solution, and I wished the MR refcount is
simply a link or bool rather than called to be a refcount.. basically I
wished we can ignore the MR refcount which is easier, taking MR part of the
owner always.  But I agree this opinion can be subjective.

Another thing I'm not 100% certain is, I believe your new design relies on
device_unparent() to happen first, during which auto-detached MRs start to
gain refcounts of the owner, and that will be released in MR's free().

Could it happen device_unparent() are not invoked on the owner?  E.g., can
something like this happen, that one creates a device, maintain it
internally, map anything, then when not needed unref() the device?

  dev = object_new(SOME_DEVICE_HAS_MRS);
  ... add dev's MRs as subregions ...
  ... after finish using the device ...
  ... remove dev's MRs from container MRs ...
  object_unref(dev);  <--- which finalize() and free() the device object

I really wish we don't go with this and find something clean, after
understanding better on the problems.  Reusing object->free() to unref()
another object but without freeing the memory at all, just sounds too
tricky for a long-term maintained project.

Thanks,
  
============= APPENDIX =============

The CPU hotplug test I did on i386, after some sequences of (guest OS runs
very new version of Linux, with some random mm patches on top of v6.17-rc4):

  - HMP: hotplug a cpu
  - guest OS: online the cpu
  - guest OS: offline the cpu
  - HMP: hotunplug the cpu
  - HMP: hotplug a cpu
  - HMP: hotunplug the cpu
  - ...

I was able to hit a KVM failure after above sequence (I won't hit it if I
keep online/offline steps in guest OS for each continuous plug/unplug):

2025-09-24T15:33:38.398617Z qemu-system-x86_64: kvm_init_vcpu: kvm_arch_init_vcpu failed (8): Invalid argument

There, it's KVM_SET_CPUID2 that failed.

When ASAN enabled, I'll see a splash:

So indeed I at least didn't see a AccelState.cpu_common_unrealize()
provided (which I was trying to look for callers of the paired API called
cpu_address_space_destroy() but surprisingly I found it's not even used
anywhere..), when it is hot unplugged:
