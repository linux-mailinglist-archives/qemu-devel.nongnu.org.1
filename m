This has been _very_ helpful. I was able to track down a few issues
based on this trace output. Yes, MorphOS doesn't seem to be following
the docs and sending HOST_DATA_LAST which is unfortunate. But they do (at
least based on these traces) seem to be sending HOST_DATA aligned to
128-bits. So the accumulator is flushed correctly at that point.

The big issue here was that this exercised another code path by setting
blit settings on the DP_MIX and DP_DATATYPE registers directly rather
than through DP_GUI_MASTER_CNTL like Xorg. That surfaced an issue where
those registers were being treated as independent state when really
DP_GUI_MASTER_CNTL is just an alias of sorts to some DP_MIX and
DP_DATATYPE registers. This was an existing issue so V4 will contain a
patch early in the series that addresses it. The path I took was to
break these fields out into their own values on the register struct.
Which makes for less shifting and masking. Curious how you feel about it
though when you get a chance to take a look.

The second issue, which was invisible because of the first was that bit
ordering was broken. I had made the mistake of ordering the bits across
the entire 32-bit word rather than for each byte. Unfortunately my test
cases were simple enough that the problem didn't become apparent until I
saw this trace output!

All that to say V4 will render bitmap fonts for TVPaint correctly. There
are some places (like buttons) that use transparency and HOST_DATA which
is not yet implemented but at least now we see the UNIMPL messages in
the log.

This was a great excuse to get MorphOS up and running so I'll be
able to test against it going forward! Thanks again for capturing these
traces.

I've also addressed all of your other feedback and will send V4 shortly.
