I don't agree with the last sentence: virtio-scsi's context isn't fixed.

The AioContext changes when dataplane is started/stopped. virtio-scsi
switches AioContext between the IOThread's AioContext and the main
loop's qemu_aio_context.

However, virtio-scsi virtqueue processing only happens in the IOThread's
AioContext. Maybe this is what you meant when you said the AioContext is
fixed?

The BH function is aware that the current AioContext might not be the
same as the AioContext at the time the BH was scheduled. That doesn't
break assumptions in the code.

(It may be possible to rewrite virtio-blk, virtio-scsi, and core
VirtIODevice ioeventfd code to use the simpler model where the
AioContext really is fixed because things have changed significantly
over the years, but I looked a few weeks ago and it's difficult work.)

I'm just pointing out that I think this description is incomplete. I
*do* agree with what this patch series is doing :).
