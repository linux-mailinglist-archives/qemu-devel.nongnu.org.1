It is still nice if we can protect internal uses; it is theoretically 
possible for the owner to remove the subregion at runtime, and we want 
to ensure the subregion will be kept alive while its container is even 
in such a case. We can do so by creating a reference to the subregion 
itself instead of its owner. I sent v4 for this change.
