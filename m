I was surprised to discover we don't name threads by default, only if we
add '-name debug-threads=yes'.  I'm struggling to understand why we would
ever want thread naming disabled, if an OS supports it ?

I'm inclined to deprecate 'debug-threads' and always set the names when
available.

The challenge is whether this build option would be enabled widely
enough to make a significant difference ?

I don't think we could really enable this in any distro builds, as
this is way too noisy to have turned on unconditionally at build
time for all users. Most containers are going to be consuming
distro builds, with relatively few building custom QEMU themselves
IME.  We might have better luck if this was a runtime option to
the -msg arg.

With regards,
Daniel
