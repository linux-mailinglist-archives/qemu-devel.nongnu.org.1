I prefer the last one you said.

This patch is indeed not easy to review, and it'll be the core of this
whole work (it'll be even more obvious if without the complexity due to
COLO and RDMA's coroutines.. that was separate from BQL status, hence
addressed in the next patch).

So the big question is, for the loadvm process, what must run with BQL
held, what must run with BQL released, and the rest will be "it's ok to run
with BQL, but optional".

Those things, no matter when drafting as a patch, or review, should better
happen in one patch, IMHO, otherwise it's unclear how each patch can be
reviewed if something was missed, when details scattered into multiple
patches.

I updated the commit message with below:

  migration: Pass in bql_held information from qemu_loadvm_state()
  
  Teach qemu_loadvm_state() and some of the internal functions to know
  whether we're holding BQL or not.
  
  Notes for some callers that are not obvious on BQL status:
  
    - process_incoming_migration_co() always invokes qemu_loadvm_state() with
      BQL held, which is the core loadvm coroutine.  The coroutine was
      explicitly entered from migration_incoming_process() which used to run
      in the main thread.
  
    - postcopy_listen_thread() always invokes qemu_loadvm_state() without
      BQL, which receives postcopy pages while VM is already started and
      running on destination (or to be started very soon).
  
    - qemu_load_device_state() / qmp_xen_load_devices_state() /
      load_snapshot() all are invoked with BQL held.
  
  The rest takes bql_held from upper layers.
  
  To reviewers: even if this is not functional change yet, it'll be the major
  core functional change after we switch to threadified loadvm soon.  Please
  treat it as one to add explicit code to mark out which part of incoming
  live migration would need to be executed always with the BQL, or would need
  to be run always without BQL.

Would it look better?

Yes.  QMP handlers must run with BQL, except oob commands.

Sure I can add it.  I'll then switch that to assert(!bql) in the next patch
when it becomes a thread.

Thanks for the careful review, this line was wrong, and it was reverted to
the right change in the next patch.. hence after the whole patchset applied
it'll be correct.

I guess it might be a fixup I applied to the wrong patch.  I'll move that
change here.  It should be false here indeed.
