I apologize, I'm not following the question here. Isn't that what this 
thread is about?

So, some background is missing here, perhaps: A few months ago, there 
was a proposal
to remove native RDMA support from live migration due to concerns about 
lack of testability.
Both IONOS and Huawei have stepped up that they are using it and are 
engaging with the
community here. I also proposed transferring over maintainership to them 
as well.  (I  no longer
have any of this hardware, so I cannot provide testing support anymore).

During that time, rsocket was proposed as an alternative, but as I have 
laid out above, I believe
it cannot work for technical reasons.

I also asked earlier in the thread if we can cover the community's 
testing concerns using softroce,
so that an integration test can be made to work (presumably through 
avocado or something similar).

Does that history make sense?
