Adding some vfio people who I hope could give some more insight. The 
question I try to find out is why accessing VRAM of a graphics card passed 
through with vfio-pci to a PPC guest running on x86_64 host with TCG is 
slow.

After looking at how vfio creates the BARs it seems to use 
memory_region_io but then also mmaps it but maybe not always. I could not 
find out how this works but there may be MMIO involved here. With KVM this 
may not be a problem but it causes TCG to break the TB at the op accessing 
the IO region and if this is in a loop it can cause freqent exits and 
looking up a new TB at least that's what I think now. Question if this 
seems correct and how could it be avoided? Can TBs be chained here to 
avoid the exit from the loop? Or why do we have io memory regions for the 
PCI memory bars in the first place when these are then mapped in the guest 
address space and accessed directly?. In hw/vfio/region.c the 
vfio_region_{read,write} memop functions seem to do two things: endian 
conversion and calling eoi to maybe ack an interrupt? Why the endian 
conversion is needed when the guest should be aware it's talking to a PCI 
device (and also the memops is defined as DEVICE_LITTLE_ENDIAN so there 
may be double conversion here)? I don't know how the interrupts work but 
this maybe only makes sense for MMIO BARs that contain registers and not 
for VRAM. Typically VRAM is marked as prefetchable so maybe for those BARs 
we could use memory regions instead of io to avoid this problem?
