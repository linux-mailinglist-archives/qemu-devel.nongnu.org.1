Hi Pierrick,

Thanks for your interest! I'm very happy to share my work on this. I've 
documented the setup process, including our code modifications and the 
step-by-step build instructions in  this link:

https://hnusdr.github.io/2025/08/09/Test-Secure-SMMU-with-Hafnium-ENG


The core point of these changes is to enable the SMMUv3 feature in 
Hafnium. This leads to numerous read/write operations on SMMUv3 secure 
registers and various queue manipulations within the smmuv3_driver_init 
function in Hafnium.

However, it's important to note that this initialization process itself 
does not initiate any DMA memory access that would trigger the 
smmuv3_translate flow.

Even so, we've devised a method to test the subsequent Secure 
Translation Path by leveraging the smmuv3-test platform device. This 
approach allows us to verify the entire SMMUv3 flow, from initialization 
to translation.

Looking ahead, my plan is to refactor the smmuv3-test platform device. 
The goal is to make it self-contained within QEMU, removing the current 
dependency on Hafnium to trigger its operations. I plan to submit this 
as a separate RFC patch series in the next few days.

However, the current version at [3] is already sufficient to test the 
code logic introduced in this RFC.
