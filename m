Isn't that what migration does always?

I don't know.

How does it break?  Error message pointing out the misconfiguration?

So the only use for "disabled" would be when migrating to or from an
older version of QEMU that doesn't support this.  Fair?

What's the default?

Makes sense to me (but I'm not a migration expert).
