I think partitioned is both inconvenient and not specific enough as there 
could be other partitioning schemes.

Having mbr=true|false would be clear enough IMO so no need for the 
negated version.

If we're already bikeshedding this I also thought fat-size may not be the 
best name as I think about 12,16,32 as fat-size so maybe it could be 
called vfat-size or similar. But why can't it just be size and when 
specified for raw vfat would use the same size (so raw truncates image to 
size and only that part is used by vfat like we have a larger disk with an 
MBR set to smaller size with unused space at the end) and when size is 
specified for vvfat it would error out if the underlying raw image does 
not match that size? Then no need for a separate option but I don't know 
if there's a problem with getting raw size from vvfat to check this or if 
that could be solved.
