There're a few things off here in that logic, rewrite it.  When at it, add
rich comment to explain each of the decisions.

Since this is very sensitive path for migration, below are the list of
things changed with their reasonings.

  (1) Exact pending size is only needed for precopy not postcopy

      Fundamentally it's because "exact" version only does one more deep
      sync to fetch the pending results, while in postcopy's case it's
      never going to sync anything more than estimate as the VM on source
      is stopped.

  (2) Do _not_ rely on threshold_size anymore to decide whether postcopy
      should complete

      threshold_size was calculated from the expected downtime and
      bandwidth only during precopy as an efficient way to decide when to
      switchover.  It's not sensible to rely on threshold_size in postcopy.

      For precopy, if switchover is decided, the migration will complete
      soon.  It's not true for postcopy.  Logically speaking, postcopy
      should only complete the migration if all pending data is flushed.

      Here it used to work because save_complete() used to implicitly
      contain save_live_iterate() when there's pending size.

      Even if that looks benign, having RAMs to be migrated in postcopy's
      save_complete() has other bad side effects:

      (a) Since save_complete() needs to be run once at a time, it means
      when moving RAM there's no way moving other things (rather than
      round-robin iterating the vmstate handlers like what we do with
      ITERABLE phase).  Not an immediate concern, but it may stop working
      in the future when there're more than one iterables (e.g. vfio
      postcopy).

      (b) postcopy recovery, unfortunately, only works during ITERABLE
      phase. IOW, if src QEMU moves RAM during postcopy's save_complete()
      and network failed, then it'll crash both QEMUs... OTOH if it failed
      during iteration it'll still be recoverable.  IOW, this change should
      further reduce the window QEMU split brain and crash in extreme cases.

      If we enable the ram_save_complete() tracepoints, we'll see this
      before this patch:

      1267959@1748381938.294066:ram_save_complete dirty=9627, done=0
      1267959@1748381938.308884:ram_save_complete dirty=0, done=1

      It means in this migration there're 9627 pages migrated at complete()
      of postcopy phase.

      After this change, all the postcopy RAM should be migrated in iterable
      phase, rather than save_complete():

      1267959@1748381938.294066:ram_save_complete dirty=0, done=0
      1267959@1748381938.308884:ram_save_complete dirty=0, done=1

  (3) Adjust when to decide to switch to postcopy

      This shouldn't be super important, the movement makes sure there's
      only one in_postcopy check, then we are clear on what we do with the
      two completely differnt use cases (precopy v.s. postcopy).

  (4) Trivial touch up on threshold_size comparision

  Which changes:

  "(!pending_size || pending_size < s->threshold_size)"

  into:

  "(pending_size <= s->threshold_size)"
