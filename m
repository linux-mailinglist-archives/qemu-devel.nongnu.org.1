That was the reason, why the "change-msg" solution was rejected in our downstream: it's safer to reuse existing channel (QMP), than to add and support an additional channel.

Yes, I mean exactly this thing. But probably I was wrong with my doubt, as queued interrupts do migrate:

virtio_save() {
...
qemu_put_8s(f, &vdev->isr);
...


Hmm. And I don't remember now, was it just theoretical doubt, or a real problem. I'll check.
