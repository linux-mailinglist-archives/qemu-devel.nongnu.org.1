However if so that'll be unfortunate.. because the goal of the "n-1" test
is to fail the exact commit that will break compatibility and make it
enforced, IMHO.

Failing for some migration guy pushing CI can be better than nothing
indeed, but it is just less ideal..  we want the developer / module
maintainer notice this issue, fix it instead of merging something wrong
already, then we try to find what is broken and ask for a fix (where there
will still be a window it's broken; and if unlucky across major releases).

Currently the coverage of n-1 test is indeed still more focused on
migration framework, but it'll also cover quite some default configs of the
system layout (even if only x86 is covered), and some default devices IIRC.
We can already attach a few more standard devices in the cmdline so more
things can get covered.

A pretty dumb (but might be working?) solution is we keep commit ID rather
than tags to avoid all kinds of tag hassles:

  PREVIOUS_VERSION_COMMIT_ID=1600b9f46b1bd08b00fe86c46ef6dbb48cbe10d6

Then we boost it after a release.  I think it'll also work for the release
commit then.

Note that there can be a small window we run n-2 -> n test at the start,
but that's fine IMHO, as we should still allow that to work.  Fabiano's
"auto choose latest shared machine type" would be useful here, and I
assume it should just work.

With that, we try to figure something that can be smarter.  Would that
work for us?
