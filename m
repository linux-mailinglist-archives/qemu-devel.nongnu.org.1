Or anything else, since the client code also has control over send(),
no? So it could give multifd a pointer to some memory and then use
send() to do whatever it wants with it. Multifd is just providing worker
threads and "scheduling".

Also note that multifd clients currently _do not_ provide IOVs. They
merely provide data to multifd (p->pages) and then convert that data
into IOVs at prepare(). This is different, because multifd currently
holds that p->pages (and turns that into p->normal), which means the
client code does not need to store the data across iterations (in the
case of RAM which is iterative).

Sorry, I don't see how what you describe is any different than what we
have. And I don't see how any of this would mean more than one
multifd_ops. We already have multifd_ops->prepare() and
multifd_ops->send(). What am I missing?
