So I understand that first, you disagree with “Always allocating 
FuseRequest objects with 64k buffers in them seems wasteful, though.” 
I.e. to just use a 64k buffer per request.  OK, fair.

Second, you suggest to improve performance by having an aligned 64k data 
buffer separate from the request metadata buffer to save on memcpy().  I 
did consider this, but discarded it because of I was afraid of the 
complexity.  Actually probably too afraid.

I’ll take a look, it actually can’t be too hard.  (Just have two 
buffers; make the metadata buffer long enough to capture all request 
headers, but only pass the sizeof(fuse_write_in)-long head into readv(), 
then check the request opcode.  If metadata spilled over to the data 
buffer, copy it back into the “shadowed” metadata buffer tail.)
