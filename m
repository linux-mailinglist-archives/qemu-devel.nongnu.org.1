Yes, but through another layer of abstraction/complexity with no real 
benefit.

There are clock sync/drift issues with the emulated hardware device's 
audio clock and the real hardware audio clock. GStreamer won't solve 
this, it requires a tuned PID loop that resamples the audio to 
compensate for the continual drift between the emulated and hardware 
clocks. Without this, over time, the audio can and does get wildly out 
of sync eventually resulting in xruns.

All you have to do is google for "QEMU Crackling Sound". JACK, PipeWire 
and PulseAudio manage to mostly hide (not sovle) this issue from the 
user, but it still occurs. It's worse for SPICE clients as the audio 
gets buffered in the network stack rather then dropped and can lead to 
many seconds of audio latency.

As for applications, we have a large number of people using QEMU/KVM 
with full GPU pass-through for gaming workloads, many of which route the 
QEMU audio into PipeWire/JACK directly which enables the host's sound 
server to perform DSP and mixing, etc.

Others are streaming the guest via Looking Glass for the video feed, and 
using PipeWire from QEMU to feed into OBS for live streaming setups.

The flexibility that JACK & PipeWire bring to the table can not be 
overstated. From a maintenance point of view, JACK and PipeWire are only 
~800 lines of code each, fully self contained and very easy to debug.

All the audio processing/mixing/resampling/routing (and any user 
configured DSP) is fully offloaded to the host's audio server, where it 
should be.

For clients like Looking Glass that take the audio via SPICE for 
rendering locally via it's own audio devices where we do additional 
things such as tracking client/host audio clocks and resample to keep 
the audio latency consistent correcting for the clock drift as mentioned 
prior.

There are quite a lot of people also using virt-viewer with Intel GVT-g 
these days too that are also limited to 48khz S16 again due to it using 
SPICE by default.

I digress though, this is a different topic entirely and I should not 
have raised it here.

Yes, but there is the DirectSound audio driver for Windows, and 
CoreAudio driver for OSX. While I appreciate that DirectSound is 
deprecated, I really think that effort should be put into implementing a 
WASAPI backend for QEMU.

I really do not think that adding all the complexity of GStreamer to 
QEMU is the right way forward. We should just hand off the audio 
processing to the host system's sound server (as we do already), 
whatever it might be, and let it do the heavy lifting.
