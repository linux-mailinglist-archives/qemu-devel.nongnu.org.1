Could wait and see whether there's any more comments from others.
Personally 4MB looks fine, as that's not a constant consumption per-vm, but
a worst case limit (probably only when there is an attacker).

Multiple VM does can indeed make it worse, but it means the attacker will
need to attack all the VMs all success, and the sum up will be 4MB /
mem_size_average_vm in percentage, irrelevant of numbers; for ~4GB average
VM size it's 0.1% memory, and even less if VM is larger - maybe not
something extremely scary even if happened.

It'll be more important to see if any one person thinks it's not okay in
this case, though. :)

If we decide to take the risk, we should merge a patch like this in as
early stage as possible of the release.

That'll be good, thanks.

I was thinking maybe we can also maintain all the mapped buffers just like
before, either in a tree, or a sorted array; the array can be even easier
and static if the limit applied here will be "maximum number of bounce
buffer mapped" rather than "maximum bytes of bounce buffer mapped", but
this whole idea may already be over-complicated to worry on leaked buffers?
The magic number sounds good enough.

No good & simple suggestion here, sorry.  We can keep the option there
until someone jumps in, then the better alternative could also come along.

After all I expect if we can choose a sensible enough default value, this
new option shouldn't be used by anyone for real.
