My datacenter had a power outage recently, so I disable my runner, and
haven't prioritized bringing it back up until now. I am glad to get this
going again, I'll look at it this weekend. 

It is a dedicated machine (R610 or Cisco UCS C220, I don't quite recall)
with I believe ~2X cores and 100+ GB memory. I hit a couple of minor
hurdles when CI started utilizing kubernetes runners, so one question I
had was whether I should install a lightweight kubernetes system and run
the gitlab kubernetes CI operator or the normal gitlab runner service. 

There should also be plenty of space to build *bsd VM's. Do pre-existing
upstream BSD images have an nocloud support so that we can build from a
stable updated base? Sorry I'm not super familiar with the BSD
ecosystems, but happy to try to fill in the gaps.

Thanks,
Eldon
