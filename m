Other than that, the [] in the help mean optional components so you don't 
need to put that in the command. But if it does not handle IPv6 addresses 
then maybe not only that's the problem. However since dest_address is 
optional and does not need to be specified you could try to leave that 
[fe80::5054:ff:fecd:585a] out completely then the rule should applie to 
all guests but if you only have one guest then it does not matter.
