I got that and did not mean to ignore those comments forever.

That's what I plan to do but got no time right now.

That's why I proposed to take this patch for now as it only moves existing 
code to another place so it does not introduce a new problem that's not 
already there. And the problem is theoretical as it does not cause a leak 
in this case and nobody raised concerns so far and it was only noticed by 
this patch making it clearer removing duplicated code. So I still think 
this patch has merit, it helped to find a bug and would make code simpler 
without making it worse so it could be taken for that. But I'm OK with 
dropping it too, I'll include it again in the series with the other 
proposed changes to fix the problem.

I'm not putting time pressure on Harsh, the coming freeze does and I don't 
have time right now to change patches only later but I don't want to miss 
a release again. I've already submitted these pegasos1 emulation series 
for the previous release but due to missing maintainer it was missed then. 
I think it's now resolved by dropping this patch and taking the rest of 
the series which is fine with me. Thanks everybody for the reviews and 
help. I'll prepare patches to resolve concerns when I'll have time again.
