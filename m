Actually that's a normal situation QEMU has to deal with.

QEMU needs to be able to expose a deterministic fixed ABI to the guest
VM, and that includes control over what CPU features are exposed to
it. In most cases, the hypervisor cannot arbitrary force enable new
guest features without agreement from QEMU.

If a guest happens to be using '-cpu host', then when a new CPU flag
arrives as part of a security fix, there is at least no CPU config
change required. QEMU may or may not need changes, in order that
the behaviour associated with the new CPU flag is correctly handled.

If the guest is using a named CPU model, as well as modifying QEMU
to know about the new flag, the host admin needs to explicitly
decide whether & when to expose the new CPU flag for each guest VM
on the host.

Until the new CPU flag is exposed to the guest, while the host itself
may be able to remain protected to the new security issue, the guest
OS is likely remain vulnerable, or have degraded operation in some way.

With regards,
Daniel
