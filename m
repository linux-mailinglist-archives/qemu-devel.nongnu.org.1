Loongson Binary Translation (LBT) is used to accelerate binary
translation. LBT feature is added in kvm mode, not supported in TCG
mode since it is not emulated.

Here lbt=on/off property is added to parse command line to
enable/disable lbt feature. Also fix registers relative lbt are saved
and restored during migration.

---
v4 ... v5:
  1. Define structure element eflags in structure LoongArchBT as
     uint32_t; in kernel eflags is defined as u64, however with
     ptrace and gdb interface it is defined u32, here defined as
     uint32_t to keep consistent from user view.
  2. sync patch with latest qemu version.

v3 ... v4:
  1. Verify and enable LBT feature in function kvm_arch_init_vcpu()
     rather than loongarch_cpu_post_init(), since LBT feature is only
     effective in kvm mode and function kvm_feature_supported() can be
     defined as static.
  2. Define structure element ftop in structure LoongArchBT as uint32_t
     to keep consist with kernel and real HW.

v2 ... v3:
  1. Property lbt is added only if kvm is enabled
  2. Use feature variable lbt with OnOffAuto type, rather than feature
     bitmap flags default_features and forced_features

v1 ... v2:
  1. Add LBT register saving and restoring in vmstate
  2. Add two pseudo feature flags: default_features and forced_features
