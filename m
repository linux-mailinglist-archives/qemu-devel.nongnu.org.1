It seems an odd commit to be causing this, but you never know=E2=80=A6 Some=
 random
thoughts on this and a few questions:



As far as I can tell, in both cases the guest display adapter is QXL. In
the case of the Debian user, I think the UI backend is SPICE? Presumably
the it's the same for the user reporting the bug directly against Qemu, as
they also seem to be using libvirt. (No full command line available as far
as I can see?) In any case, the SPICE display specifies:

    .dpy_cursor_define       =3D display_mouse_define,

Which means the old dpy_cursor_define_supported() would have been returning
true prior to this commit, with the modified QXL and VMSvga code paths
theoretically unaffected. A bit odd, to say the least.

But I suppose it's possible that my understanding is incorrect, and
dpy_cursor_define_supported() might have returned false. The code in
qxl_render_cursor that follows this check and which will now always run, vs
would not have done previously includes:

    if (qxl->debug > 1 && cmd->type !=3D QXL_CURSOR_MOVE) {
        fprintf(stderr, "%s", __func__);
        qxl_log_cmd_cursor(qxl, cmd, ext->group_id);
        fprintf(stderr, "\n");
    }

Can we get the user to set qxl->debug to a value > 1 and see if the freeze
coincides with logging from here? (Possibly tricky to intercept the fprintf
output from Qemu run via libvirt though.)

I also notice that the subsequent code in the QXL_CURSOR_SET case looks a
lot like the code being replaced by Michael's patch from the Qemu bug
tracker. (qxl_phys2virt calls) It looks OK to me, but I'm not familiar with
QXL at all, so perhaps a chunk of code that could use another review?


Or could it be a timing-dependent bug? Although the removed check should
have been rather cheap and shouldn't affect timing much:
- if (!dpy_cursor_define_supported(qxl->vga.con)) {
-        return 0;
-    }



Given that "The time before the freeze seems to be random, from a few
seconds to a couple of minutes." there is a possibility of a false
negative during the bisect. (i.e. commit marked GOOD that should be BAD
because it happened to not hit the freeze in the usual time) If that was
the case, we would expect the regression to be caused by a nearby *earlier*
commit. The only candidate I can spot that touches SPICE or QXL or the
display subsystem in general is a418e7a (ui/console: Convert mouse
visibility parameter into bool) from the same patchset which looks even
more benign, however.



We could ask the user to check whether there's any connection with mouse
cursor changes, e.g. whether he can more easily provoke the issue by
perform actions that rapidly change the mouse cursor. (For example by
visiting https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor in the
guest and moving back and forth over the test area.)


Is there an easy way to take a sampling profile on Linux that will show us
stack traces of all the threads in the frozen Qemu process? On macOS this
is easy with the Activity Monitor GUI or iprofiler on the command line.
That ought to confirm whether it's a deadlock or indefinite wait in some
Qemu subsystem.


Michael, what's the situation with the patch you suggested in your comment
on the Qemu bug:
https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/1628#note_2144606625 ? Is
there any chance we can get the Debian user to try that?



Hope that helps!
Phil
