TPM is the only thing we have outside of confidential computing.  So
naturally there is alot of code and infrastructure for that despite the
complexity of TPMs.  So having vTPMs in CVMs allows to reuse that
infrastructure and it totally makes sense to support that.

That doesn't imply this is the only option to handle things.  Having the
option to tie everything to the launch measurement makes sense too.
Fair point.

How should I answer that one while we are still discussing the design?

Of course you can, but it'll break the RH signature.

Well.  If you want put the db into the igvm and the igvm into the uki
you've got a chicken-and-egg problem.  Moving the firmware from the main
UKI to UKI add-on would solve that.

certificate, not signature.  But, yes, that would work.

Well, if at the end of the day we'll go pass on a 'db' both signatures
and hashes can be used.

So you'll have the RH UKI + customer add-on with the kernel command
line.  And you need a customized igvm containing a 'db' which will allow
both, either via certificate+signature or via hash, whatever you prefer.

If the customer agrees they can go for hashes.  If not they should be
able to use certificates.  So patching the RH shipped UKI is not an
option.

It's surely possible to ship two variants, one with the RH certificates
and one blank, so customers can pick the latter if they want allow
specific hashes only.

Not convinced a PE binary is a good idea.  Adds one more indirection for
no obvious gain.

Absolutely.  Just wanted to make sure we are talking about the same thing.

take care,
