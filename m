Yes, at least doing that would take care of this particular case. You
might like to have that case in the retry loop too, if possible.

I don't suppose the API can resume fetching from an offset and it might
be getting overkill to care so much, but that does allow the client to
see the error (wget attempts again after short xfer then gets a 503).

It seems not. I posted a new series that tries to handle it. And
adds a new asset specific exception.
