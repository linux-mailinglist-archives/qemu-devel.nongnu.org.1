Given your original job had cache of 447 MB, and new cache is 654 MB, the
old cache is 68% of size of the new cache. So effectively your 63% is
high 90's cache hit rate of what was present.

This would suggest a cache size of 700 MB is more appropriate, unless some
other jobs have even high usage needs.
