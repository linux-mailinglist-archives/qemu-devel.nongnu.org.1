I do not get why you can't wait for the 1st device to be attached to
"freeze" the settings. Is it because you may also have some bridges /
root ports also attached to the same viommu. As those latter do not have
any adherence to the host SMMU, is that a problem?

this can only be possible if, on the command line you connect the vsmmu
to a sysfs path to the host iommu (or maybe this is what you meant in
3). This would be another option we also evoked in the past. But this is
not very user friendly for the guy who launches the VM to care both the
device and the associated physical SMMU. Logically we could build that
relationship automatically.

I don't think this is sensible as there may be plenty of those, each
requirement a libvirt adaptation
