Hi Mostafa,

Thank you your suggestion.

You've made a very good point. This patch is indeed too large and tries 
to cover too many different areas. For the v2 series, I will break this 
patch down into logical parts as you suggested (STE parsing, page table 
handling, etc.).

I also acknowledge your concern about the stage-2 handling logic from 
your comment on patch 2. I have sent a separate, detailed reply to your 
feedback on patch #2 that outlines my new understanding.

And as you commented on patch #01:

I'm sorry to hear that it has broken your environment. Please don't 
hesitate to share any details, logs, or reproduction steps when you find 
them. I am more than happy to help reproduce the issue on my end to get 
it fixed as quickly as possible.


I would be delighted to hear back from you on any of the topics we've 
discussed, as any further guidance you can offer would be invaluable.

Thanks,

Tao
