It still doesn't explain the motivation.

For example, "[PULL 01/17] tests/docker: expose $HOME/.cache/qemu as 
docker volume" does explain its motivation. It says:

So, with the patch, containers will no longer require continually 
re-downloading images, which is nice.

Back to this memory region patch, what does it contribute? What's nice 
with this patch?

Things that involve concurrency and memory safety will often become 
theoretical.

For example, I recently changed a concurrency algorithm with the 
following patch:
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20250526-event-v4-0-5b784cc8e1de@daynix.com/

All reviews were theoretical and did not provide any test case. These 
reviews still matter and I replied them by providing my theory, which 
eventually materialized as a documentation patch:
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/b41eb6f4-96b8-47bf-90cf-e4918a613dcf@daynix.com/T/#m2603d613d8d8cbbe87b4dce63fd2663c58d52e55

The standards are not mine, but documented in:
docs/devel/submitting-a-patch.rst

A reviewer don't have a right to veto but the mentioned documentation 
says they can still get a submitter's counterargument when the submitter 
disagrees with them. Reviews should not be just silently ignored.
