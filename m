do you mean KVM handles the first hardware #UD due to the wrong opcode 
of hypercall by directly emulate the hypercall instead of going to 
emulator to patch the guest memory with modifying the guest memory?

If so, I agree with it. I thought the same solution and had no bandwidth 
and motivation to raise the idea to KVM community.
