"COLD" isn't an "ordinary system reset", though -- COLD
reset is more like "I powered the computer off and then
turned it on again". A "WARM" reset is like "I pressed
the front panel reset button, or the watchdog device
fired and reset the system". We don't currently really
model front-panel or watchdog reset properly, we assume
that it's close enough to have it be the same as
power-off-and-on reset (and there are some kludges in
various places where it's not quite right).

(There's an awkward conflict here with our rom blob
system, which currently does a "copy any guest images
back into RAM" on reset. Should we do that on warm
reset? For some usecases you want those original
images back again, but for "guest did a kexec" you
almost certainly don't...)

On the other hand, if virtio-mem does want to treat them
the same we could start with only implementing WARM and
not add WAKEUP until we have a use-case for it.

By the way, I assume this patchseries is 9.2 material,
not trying to fix a bug for this release ?
