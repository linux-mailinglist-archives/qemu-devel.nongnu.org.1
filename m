These look fine so far, as long as -object cmdline doesn't allow to specify
the same thing again.

I think it should work but only without VFIO.  When with VFIO there must
have no private pages at all or migrating is racy with concurrent DMAs
(yes, AFAICT CPR can run migration with DMA running..).

CPR has a pretty tricky way of using VFIO pgtables in that it requires the
PFNs to not change before/after migration.  Feel free to have a look at
VFIO_DMA_MAP_FLAG_VADDR in vfio.h then you may get a feeling of it.
