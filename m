I've got a vague memory that a tricky case is when some of your storage
devices are broken on the destination, but not all.
So you tell the block layer you want to take them on the destination
some take their lock, one fails;  now what state are you in?
I'm not sure if the block layer had a way of telling you what state
you were in when I was last involved in that.
