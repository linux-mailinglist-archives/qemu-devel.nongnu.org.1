I just realized: when we are trying to punch holes, a pre-zeroing pass
still does double I/O on portions of the source that are allocated
(once to punch the hole, another to write it back to non-zero).  That
was the best earlier patches could do, without fine-grained zero
tracking.  But with this patch, we can do better:

If we are punching holes, leaving the zero bitmap clear (at this
stage) and setting the entire dirty bitmap will cause the entire image
to be visited, and punch holes only where they are needed, without a
pre-zeroing pass.

I will add that as a followup patch (no need to invalidate the reviews
on this one).
