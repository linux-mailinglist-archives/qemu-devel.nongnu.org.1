It definitely wasn't once upon a time. It may still not be true on the
oldest mypy we currently support. We don't have a clear policy for what
versions of python libraries we need to support - this is a muddy, gray
area. So far I just try to avoid breaking support on older versions
needlessly, but I don't have an upgrade policy.

If we want to integrate this directly into make check, we'll likely need to
formalize this policy.

okey-dokey, let me integrate this feedback and I'll re-send, but I'm going
to wait until we hash everything else out - you had some questions on other
bits in this series.
