Even if the change is backwards compatible not breaking existing usage 
just adding additional ways to specify same value?

I may not understand this problem completely and may have forgotten what I 
understood but I think the proposed solution only added new alternative 
names for existing values so the old values still work. Then the only way 
this could break if somebody using new names want them to work on older 
QEMU versions but that's not reasonable. Also JSON is not primarily used 
by humans but by management apps and scripts which won't change the names 
they use when we add new names that will likely only be used on the 
command line so this should not break it even if those apps or script are 
used with older QEMU.

The problem is that the default value is 0 and that means false. You can't 
change it without either changing the default or requiring to set the 
default explicitly which may need a lot of changes and error prone so we 
should keep the current default to avoid this.

This case works as the default value matches the uninitialised value but 
would not work for bool.

This would change the value for false as 0 is now taken to mean auto so 
either all places that assume false need to be updated or if we use 
different value for auto then all places need to explicitly set that and 
you can't easily change a bool into OnOffAuto.

What is the core of the issue that you don't like about allowing on/off 
for bool? If it's just some cases are not covered and still would not 
accept alternative names would it be easier to fix those?
