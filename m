GitHub spells it "Copilot".

Claude is very popular for coding at the moment and probably worth mentioni=

More detail is needed on what an "AI code generator" is. Coding
assistant tools range from autocompletion to linters to automatic code
generators. In addition there are other AI-related tools like ChatGPT
or Gemini as a chatbot that can people use like Stackoverflow or an
API documentation summarizer.

I think the intent is to say: do not put code that comes from _any_ AI
tool into QEMU.

It would be okay to use AI to research APIs, algorithms, brainstorm
ideas, debug the code, analyze the code, etc but the actual code
changes must not be generated by AI.
