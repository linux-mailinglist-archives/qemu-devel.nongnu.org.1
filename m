Ok, thank you very much for the information!=0A=0ASo I should first try t=
o make my library available in one of the distros used for CI. As I under=
stand these are Alpine, Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS and OpenSUSE. OK, =
I'll try it first :)=0A=0ARegarding QAPI, I'd say it would be cool if it =
was allowed... I'm not sure if GPL circumvention is a real risk, because =
in some way it's already possible via the vhost-user protocol %). But it'=
s up to you to decide of course :)=0A=0A> I'm not speaking for the QEMU p=
roject. I hope to be helpful anyway. I=0A> am the QAPI maintainer, so my =
thoughts carry a bit more weight there.=0A> =0A> I understand your block =
