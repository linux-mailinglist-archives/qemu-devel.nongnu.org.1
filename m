In topology related part, SMT (of x86) usually represents the logical
processor level. And thread has the same meaning. To change these
meanings is also possible, but I think it should be based on the actual
use case. we can consider the complexity of the implementation when
there is a need.

There are some uses for topology, such as it affects scheduling behavior,
and it affects feature emulation, etc.

At least as you said, KVM (for x86) doesn't consider higher-level topologies
at the moment, but that's not to say that it won't in the future, as certain
registers do have topology dependencies.

Each CPU object will create a (software) thread, you can refer the
function "kvm_start_vcpu_thread(CPUState *cpu)", which will be called
when CPU object realizes.

As I said, an example is spapr ("spapr_possible_cpu_arch_ids()"), which
maps possible_cpu to core object. However, this is a very specific
example, and like Igor's slides said, I understand it's an architectural
requirement.

I don't seem to understand...There is a ¡°threads¡± parameter in -smp, does
this not satisfy your use case?
