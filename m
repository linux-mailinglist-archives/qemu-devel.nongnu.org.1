We can certainly make things stable when we're reasonably convinced they
are, and have a need for it.

Yes, that's better.

Yes.

I suggest to try combining references to the spec with just enough
explanation to serve as reminders for the people familiar with this
stuff, and maybe even as terse overview for the rest of us.

Abbreviating a long title is okay as long the full title is still easy
enough to find.  But always abbreviate the same way, please.

Better.

Would it make sense to add a short paragaph on what's missing there?

Vaguely similar: when device_del merely initiates hot unplug, and
completion requires guest cooperation.  This puts management
applications into an awkward position.  What if they don't get
DEVICE_DELETED event within a reasonable time?  What is a reasonable
time?  We later added DEVICE_UNPLUG_GUEST_ERROR to avoid this for the
common case of well-behaved guests.

I'm not asking you to do anything about this now.  Spelling it out in
documentation seems advisable, though.

One, it adds relatively little over "region number", and two, it's not
