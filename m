Correct.  I'm not confident where or how to document this dependency
since cross-referencing commands/data structures does not seem to be the
convention here.  My first thought is to mention how deprecated
properties are expanded under the @CpuModelExpansionType.  Something like:

Thanks for the feedback!  Pending your response to the above, I'll post
a v4.
