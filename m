We already do such interations in vfio_save_iterate()?

My understanding is the recent VFIO work is based on the fact that the VFIO
device can track device state changes more or less (besides being able to
save/load full states).  E.g. I still remember in our QE tests some old
devices report much more dirty pages than expected during the iterations
when we were looking into such issue that a huge amount of dirty pages
reported.  But newer models seem to have fixed that and report much less.

That issue was about GPU not NICs, though, and IIUC a major portion of such
tracking used to be for GPU vRAMs.  So maybe I was mixing up these, and
maybe they work differently.

Thanks,
