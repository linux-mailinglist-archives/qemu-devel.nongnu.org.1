Right, this used to be discussed here and you were also in the loop:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20190228122822.GD4970@work-vm/

I kind of agree join() would be perfect, disregard the question on whether
QEMU would still benefit from a singleton interface, no matter migration
would rely on that for refcounting, or simply it'll also make sense to just
avoid people creating random migration objects.

So yes, I think migration can benefit from singleton idea for more than one
reason, while the refcount issue here might be even better resolved by
join() in main.

It's just that in the thread Dave raised a few points on possible
challenges on join() in the main thread.  I'm not sure whether we should go
that route instead.  Obviously I am digging one of our legacy rabbit holes
from when I started to look at this "access current_migration anywhere"
issue reported from VFIO.  But if some of us think we should give it a
shot, I can try.  After all, I started digging.

Another simpler but direct solution to "access current_migration" is, we
simply don't free it at all, leaving process exit() to do the job.  Then I
can drop all object_[un]ref() for the migration object.  I think that could
work too, but ugly, for the refcount issue.

Thanks,
