Thank you, now I think I understand the problem.

I think you need to backport commit 9379ea9db3c0 ("virtio-net: Add 
queues before loading them") and adda0ad56bd2 ("virtio-net: Add queues 
for RSS during migration"). Here is an explanation:

First, let me define two variables for conciseness:
N: the number of queue pairs
M: the maximum number of queue pairs, which is determined with
    n->max_queue_pairs

The problem is that QEMU inconsistently chose N for virtio-net in the 
past. Before commit 8c49756825da ("virtio-net: Add only one queue pair 
when realizing"):
1) realize() chose M.
2) set_features() chose: 1 (when RSS and MQ are disabled)
                          M (otherwise)

This itself was a problem; both RSS and MQ were disabled when realize() 
but N was M, which is inconsistent with 2) and this inconsistency was 
guest-visible.

I wrote commit 8c49756825da ("virtio-net: Add only one queue pair when 
realizing") to make QEMU implement the behavior in 2) also during 
realization and fix the inconsistency, but it broke migration when the 
migrated VM had enabled VIRTIO_NET_F_RSS and VIRTIO_NET_F_MQ because it 
expected that N == M.

This is also why the backported commit also broke migration; it 
accidentally fixed the inconsistency between the first reset state and 
the state after set_features() and caused the same problem.

I wrote commit 9379ea9db3c0 ("virtio-net: Add queues before loading 
them") to fix the issue and later complemented it with commit 
adda0ad56bd2 ("virtio-net: Add queues for RSS during migration").

There are several relevant commits because I could not fix the 
underlying problem at once, but hopefully this email clarifies how the 
two commits fixed it in the end.

Akihiko Odaki
