It defines an Error without any frills attached. It is used below but
on the other hand it results in those "unknown error"s that you
rightly despised.

> Does the name Error risk confusion with std::error::Error?

Maybe, but as you can see from e.g. ayhow::Error it's fairly common to
have each crate or module define its own Error type. In the end you
always convert them to another type with "?" or ".into()".

It makes for slightly nicer code, and avoids having to worry about
panics from ".unwrap()" in error handling code (where panicking
probably won't help much). Otherwise it's probably not a good idea,
but also not something that people will use since (see later patches)
it's easier to return a decent error message than an empty Error.

Because description() cannot build a dynamically-allocated string, it
must return something that is already available in the Error. That
limitation is probably why it was deprecated.

Since it's deprecated we can expect that it won't be used and not
worry too much.

It says "every other field comes from "..Default::default()". I can
replace it with "cause: None", and likewise below.

Yes, this is for strings that are not allocated and are always
valid---such as string constants.

Yes, Default::default()

Alternatively:

    result
       .map_err(|err| unsafe { err.propagate(errp) })
       .ok()

Shorter, but the functional style can be off putting. What do you prefer?

Yeah, here "self" must be first so that you use it as a method.
Though, s/result/self/ as you noted.

I will copy from `error_propagate` in v2.

In Rust there are three kinds of functions that use errors. Two are in qemu=
_api:

(1) bridges from C to Rust function pointers. They receive a Result<>
from Rust functions and use error_propagate() (probably via functions
such as ok_or_propagate, bool_or_propagate, etc.) to prepare a C
return value.

(2) bridges from Rust to C functions. They pass an Error** to the C
function and use err_or_else() or err_or_unit() to prepare a Rust
return value

Functions of kind (1) are like functions in C that do a single call
and just pass down errp, for example user_creatable_add_qapi(). These
do not need ERRP_GUARD() because:

* the conversion from Result<> to C is pretty much a necessity, and
it's done with functions that guarantee the propagation

* the conversion function *consumes* the Result<>, guaranteeing that
you do not propagate more than once with tragic results

Function of kind (2) do not need ERRP_GUARD() because they do not take
an Error** at all. They pass one down to C, but they return a
Result<>.

The third kind is Rust functions that are called from (1) and that
themselves call (2). These are where ERRP_GUARD() would be used in C,
but in Rust these do not see Error** at all. The "?" operator has the
same effect as ERRP_GUARD(), i.e. it handles passing the error from
called function to return value. What in C would be

   ERRP_GUARD();
   if (!func_that_returns_bool(...)) { return; }

In Rust is

   func_that_returns_result(...)?;

which is a bit disconcerting in the beginning but grows on you.
(Generally I find that to be the experience with Rust. It's downright
weird, but unlike C++ the good parts outweigh the weirdness).

No problem. While this is kinda important, it's not used yet. The
clients would look like this:

fn type_get_or_load_by_name(name: &str) -> Result<&TypeImpl> {
   unsafe {
       let err: *mut bindings::Error =3D ptr::null_mut();
       let typ: *mut TypeImpl =3D bindings::type_get_or_load_by_name(
           name.clone_to_foreign().as_ptr(), &mut err);
       // on success, "typ" can be accessed safely
       // on failure, turn the Error* into a qemu_api::Error and free it
       Result::err_or_else(err, || &*typ)
}

This is why I need to write tests.

Good, since these *Foreign traits are not part of the standard
library, but rather something that I concocted and published outside
QEMU. If you had no problems understanding how they were used (e.g.
stuff like into_native or clone_to_foreign_ptr), that is good.
