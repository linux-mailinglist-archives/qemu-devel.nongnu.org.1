Thanks Thomas,

I replied to the patch as well, but the setter does other validation 
beyond just the characters.  In particular it ensures a loadparm value 
is assigned only to boot devices.  This has significance when probing 
for devices, since the per-device loadparm value is stored in the IPLB, 
and an IPLB is only generated for devices with an assigned boot index.

I would say the scsi loadparm probing issue is actually a legitimate 
concern since it can result in unexpected behavior with which kernel is 
selected, but probably we want to avoid adding too much s390x specific 
validation to the common code, so I'm not sure what the best solution 
is.  Maybe there is a better way to restrict the loadparm to boot 
devices that doesn't need the property setter?

On a side note, while testing your patch I also realized that the 
machine loadparm was being ignored during probing, so I've sent out a 
patch to fix that...

Thanks again for all the help with this,
     Jared Rossi
