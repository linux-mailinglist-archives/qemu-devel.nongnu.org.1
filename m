Oh, that sounds cool, I've always dreamed of something like this.

Note for myself: look through the QEMU wiki, it may contain quite interesting things,
not only "QEMU Planning" and "Submit a Patch" :)

For live-update with backend transfer, we'll probably can not only check the
device tree, but recreate it automatically, using information from target.

O I thought about this too.

Off topic:

Didn't you think about moving to some context-free protocol for migration
stream? Current protocol is hardly bound to migration states definitions
in the code. This, for example, makes writing an external tool to analyze the
stream almost impossible. As well, any misconfiguration leads to strange
error, when we treat data wrongly on the target.

I imagine.. json? Or something like this.. So that we can always understand
the structure of incoming object, even if we don't know, what exactly we
are going to get. This also simplifies expanding the state in new verions:
we just add a new field into migratable object, and can handle absent field
in incoming stream.
