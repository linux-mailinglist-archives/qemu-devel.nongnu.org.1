v1 -> v2:
- provide CXL exclusive MMIO32 & MMIO64 space
- hard coded two cxl root ports

RFC because
- Many contents are ported from Jonathan' patch on qemu virt design

- Less experience and not particularly confident in sbsa-ref address space design
  so this might be stupidly broken in a way I've not considered.

Currently the base CXL support for arm platforms is only on Jonathan's patches[1]
which have not yet merged into upstream. SBSA-REF can be more like a real machine,
thus the support of cxl could be meaningful.

This series leverages Jonathan's patches[1] to design [SBSA_CXL_HOST] and
[SBSA_CXL_FIXED_WINDOW] spaces for sbsa-ref layout. 

For [SBSA_CXL_HOST], since this creates a default pxb-cxl (bus_nr=0xc0) bridge
with two cxl root ports on sbsa-ref, the new memory layout places 64K space for
one hard coded cxl host bridge register regions in the sbsa-ref memmap. 

According to above design, for now only two cxl type3 devices could be added on
the cxl host. 

With the 'create_pxb_cxl', users don't need to input '-device pxb-cxl' and 
'-device cxl-rp' parameters.

In addition, this support indepentent mmio32(32M) & mmio64(1M) space which are
enough for cxl components, because in this way the previous pcie mmio32/64 space
would not be divided and affected. 

However, with the pxb-cxl-host, any cxl root ports and cxl endpoint devices would
occupy the BDF number of the original pcie domain. Hence, the max available pcie
devices on sbsa-ref would decrease, which seems to bring a series of trouble. 
I'm looking for some comments on the problems and suggestions on if there are better
ways to do it.

For [SBSA_CXL_FIXED_WINDOW], in order to provide CFMWs on sbsa-ref, this extends 1TB
space from the hole above RAM Memory [SBSA_MEM] for CXL Fixed Memory Window. 
0xA0000000000 is chosen as the base address of this space because of 3 reasons:

1) It is more suitable to choose a static address instead of that
implementation in virt, since a dynamic address space layout of
sbsa-ref is not appropriate for its original purpose as a reference
platform.

2) The Hotplug Memory address range should in the range of maximum
addressable range of sbsa-ref platform(0x10000000000-0x80ffffffffff).
It is satisfied the requirements of memory hotplug in linux kernel.

3) The start pfn of CFMW should exceed the reserved_pfn_range for
onlined numa node.

Based on 'cxl_fmws_link_targets', this adds a new function
'sbsa_cxl_fmws_link_targets' for binding cfmws.target with the default
pxb-cxl-bus on sbsa-ref.

In addition, this also adds 'create_cxl_fixed_window_region' to support 
creating a static cfmw region on sbsa-ref, so users don't need to input
'-M cxl-fmw' parameter.

Thus, to run sbsa-ref with a cxl device could use:
qemu-system-aarch64 \
-object memory-backend-file,id=mem2,mem-path=/tmp/mem2,size=256M,share=true \
-device cxl-type3,bus=cxl.0,volatile-memdev=mem2,id=cxl-mem1 \

By the way, since the matched firmware correspond to this patch would allocate
pcie bus 0xc0 ~ 0xff to pxb-cxl-host, we should add "bus=pcie.0" when we want 
to plug some devices on the original pcie bus, for example:
-device qemu-xhci,bus=pcie.0 \
or
-device nvme,serial=deadbeef,bus=pcie.0,drive=hdd \
-drive file=../disk/hdd.qcow2,format=qcow2,id=hdd,if=none \

This series patches are here to hopefully some comments to guide me!
