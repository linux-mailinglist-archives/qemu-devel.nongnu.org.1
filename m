Commenting on my own patch:

After re-reading docs/devel/style.rst, I can see that this particular
forward declaration of QIONetListener is not consistent with the
guidelines.  I have to have a forward reference, since the style guide
also forbids circular inclusion (net-listener.h already includes
channel-socket.h, so channel-socket.h cannot include net-listener.h);
but it may be better for me to move the forward reference into
include/qemu/typedefs.h rather than inlining it how I did here.

(It is a red herring that struct QIOChannelSocket{} already contains
two other uses of 'struct' in its declaration body - both of those are
for 'struct sockaddr_storage' which is the POSIX type always spelled
with struct, with no typical QEMU CamelCase wrapper)

Also, I added an explicit zero initialization to the new member to
match existing explicit initializers.  But checking qom/object.c, I
see that object_new() first uses g_malloc() instead of g_new0(), but
then calls object_initialize_with_type() does a forced memset(,0,) -
so all object constructors that do explicit field initialization to
zero are doing redundant work.

Dropping the sioc->listener = NULL assignment from this patch thus
makes sense from the less work perspective, but now that I've pointed
it out, dropping the sioc->zero_copy_* = 0 lines makes sense too.  But
cleanups like that should probably be a separate patch, and maybe
touch as many clients of object_new() as possible (perhaps via
Coccinelle?), rather than shoehorning in a deletion of just those two
lines into a v2 of this particular patch.
