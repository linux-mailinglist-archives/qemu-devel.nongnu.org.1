OK, I checked with misterious force and looks like it's ok.

Would you please rephrase the comment, though?  I want to make it crystal
clear that what we're looking for is not holding BQL.. Maybe something like
this:

    /*
     * The VFIO load_cleanup() implementation is BQL-sensitive. It requires
     * BQL must NOT be taken when recycling load threads, so that it won't
     * block the load threads from making progress on address space
     * modification operations.
     *
     * To make it work, we could try to not take BQL for all load_cleanup(),
     * or conditionally unlock BQL only if bql_locked() in VFIO.
     *
     * Since most existing call sites take BQL for load_cleanup(), make
     * it simple by taking BQL always as the rule, so that VFIO can unlock
     * BQL and retake unconditionally.
     */

We may also want to update the subject.  Currently:

  "migration: postcopy_ram_listen_thread() should take BQL for some calls"

It's not accurate anymore, it could be:

  "migration: Always take BQL for migration_incoming_state_destroy()"

If with all above, please feel free to take:

Acked-by: Peter Xu <peterx@redhat.com>

I'm OK if it'll be touched up when merge too.

Thanks,
