The problem is that add-ons are

   1) Separate binaries. So you need to match multiple files.
   2) In this case, get generated out of the vendor (RH)'s control in a 
one-off fashion.

I don't think "signing" is the correct way to address the latter. It's 
rather hashing. But I agree with you that it could (should?) be hashing 
at the PE loader level similar or identical to Secure Boot rather than a 
separate hashing mechanism.

2 points here here:

   1) With add-ons, there are multiple binaries. We can't only pass a 
single one.
   2) The security posture of the system may be different between 2 
validly signed images. Think of Daniel's example of verbose kernel 
output. Maybe I consider verbose kernel output already inacceptable, 
while RH thinks it's an ok posture to have. The user needs to have the 
chance to differentiate between a system booted with or without verbose 
kernel output.

Yes, I think you want to have one or multiple pages with what 
effectively is a db append variable update blob. Or even a full variable 
store blob. Then a built-in always-on UEFI Secure Boot that runs in 
kernel mode rather than SMM. The IGVM should dictate the physical 
location of that blob so that you can precalculate the launch digest 
with the blob included. Ukify.py then generates the blob along with the 
FUKI.

I agree, from a vmfwupdate point of view, we would basically have an 
IGVM. The IGVM describes 2 special page (ranges?): One for the CPUID 
special page, one for the variable store seed. To precalculate the 
launch digest you would need the firmware IGVM, and the seed blob.

All unauthenticated data, such as locations of the UKI and its add-ons 
gets passed as parameter to the firmware IGVM.

Does the flow above align with your preferences? :)
