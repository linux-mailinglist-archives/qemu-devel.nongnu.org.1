For testing MorphOS see https://qmiga.codeberg.page/#morphos (there's a 
link at the top of the page to the MorphOS page where a demo iso is 
available from). (I think I've already sent 
https://codeberg.org/qmiga/pages/wiki/SubprojectAti but if not you may 
also want to have a look there.) I also had a bug ticket about CCE but I 
did not move that when moving to codeberg but I still have it saved so 
I'll try to extract info from it and post it but it does not have any 
break trhough just a summary on what may be needed for CCE. It might still 
give some hints if you consider fixing that so I'll dig that up.

Regards,
BALATON Zoltan
