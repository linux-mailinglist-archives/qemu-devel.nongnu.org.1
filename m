Or is it "something might have dirtied, just resend in stage 2"?

This is an important bit of detail I've been missing so far.  Easy
enough to fix in a future commit message and cover letter.

Such prep work commonly depends only on device configuration, not state.
I'm curious: what state bits exactly does the prep work need?

Device configuration is available at the start of stage 1, state is
fully available only at the end of stage 2.

Your patches make *tentative* device state available in stage 1.
Tentative, because it may still change afterwards.

You use tentative state to do certain expensive work in stage 1 already,
in order to cut downtime in stage 2.

Fair?

Can state change in ways that invalidate this work?

If yes, how do you handle this?

If no, do you verify the "no change" design assumption holds?

Aside: ugly error cascade due to migration's well-known failure to
propagate errors up properly.

It's messy.  If we started on a green field today, we'd do better, I
hope.

What error message do you observe when only one side enables
@virtio-iterative?  Question is moot if you plan to switch to a
different interface.  Answer it for that interface in a commit message
then.

>>> I don't believe the source/destination could be aware of the misconfiguration. IIUC the destination reads the migration stream and expects certain pieces of data in a certain order. If new data is added to the migration stream or the order has changed and the destination isn't expecting it, then the migration fails. It doesn't know exactly why, just that it read-in data that it wasn't expecting.

In my understanding, migration requires identical machine types on both
ends, and all bets are off when they're different.

Migration failures due to mismatched configuration tend to be that way,
don't they?

You can use qom-set to change a device property after you created the
device.  It might even work.  However, qom-set is a deeply problematic
and seriously underdocumented interface.  Avoid.

But will you need to change it?

If you started the source with an explicit property value, start the
destination the same way.  Same as for any number of other configuration
knobs.

If you started the source with the default property value, start the
destination the same way.  Values will match as long as the machine type
matches, as it should.
