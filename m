So, according to the SPDX License List matching guidelines, changes to
BSD-3-Clause-Modification can only be seen as equivalent if at most the
clauses are stated in a different order, as indicated by the red text?

I assume we agree that the first three clauses match BSD-3-Clause.
To show that the fourth clause matches BSD-3-Clause-Modification, I
split up both license texts and indented MCD API's license:

If any files are modified, you must

  Modification of any or all of the source code, documentation and other
  materials provided under this license are subject to

cause the modified files to carry prominent notices

  acknowledgement of the modification(s) by including a prominent notice
  on the modification(s)

stating that you changed the files

  stating the change(s) to the file(s)
  ... and stating the name of the publisher of any such modification(s)

and the date of any change.

  identifying the date of such change

Stated like this, I think it is appropriate to see both clauses as
equivalent. Since the contributor appendix on the third clause is not
present in BSD-3-Clause-Modification, we have to specify the composite

Valid-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause-Modification AND BSD-3-Clause

Under which conditions is this Valid-License-Identifier ...well...
valid? IIUC, we either need a formal approval from SPDX legal team or a
relicensing of the MCD API. Is there maybe another way?

Best regards,
Mario
