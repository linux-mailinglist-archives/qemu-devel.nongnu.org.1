Ideally, HMP commands are human-friendly wrappers around QMP commands.
Such commands can't do anything that could be done with QMP.

Not all the functionality of QMP needs to be exposed in HMP.  Some
functionality might only exist in QMP.  How much to expose is a
pragmatic "is it worth the bother?" decision.

Certain HMP commands make no sense in QMP.  Examples:

* HMP cpu sets the default CPU.  The concept doesn't exist in QMP.

* Ad hoc debugging commands that are used only by humans, such as
  sync-profile.

* The desk calculator[*]

My abstract mental model of MCD has it completely separate from monitors
(HMP and QMP).  Just like gdbstub.

We're considering to use QAPI/QMP as interface definition and transport
infrastructure.

Mario's patches do that in a simple way: by "embedding" MCD in the QMP
monitor.  This creates a coupling that doesn't exist in my abstract
mental model.

We could have a separate QAPI schema for interface definition, and a
separate socket for transport.  This avoids coupling.

Obviously, we'd still want to reuse existing QMP infrastructure as much
as practical.  Some of that that code is gnarly.  If we're not careful,
we get some subtle coupling deep under the hood.

Here's one possible complication.  While we can have any number of QMP
monitors, we still funnel most[**] commands to the main loop thread,
where they run one after the other.  If we reuse all that machinery for
MCD, we end up forcing MCD commands through the same funnel to the main
loop thread.  This coupling could be undesirable.

Before we contemplate how to press the existing QMP infrastructure into
service for MCD, we should first figure out how we'd want MCD to operate
if we started on a green field.  Can we have more than one MCD
connection?  Which thread should execure MCD commands?  Any locking
requirements?  Any need for asynchronous commands?


[*] Which arguably makes no sense in HMP either.

[**] Not out-of-band commands.  You probably don't want to know more.
