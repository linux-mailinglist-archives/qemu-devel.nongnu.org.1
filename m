Correct, which is what boot.efi does. That mapping only tells firmware 
about the change from old VA -> new VA though.

The spec says that calling SetVirtualAddressMap is optional from the 
firmware's point of view. A boot loader may call it - and even depend on 
its functionality. The spec even goes further and almost endorses the 
case boot.efi does:

You can absolutely read that paragraph as "From here on, only virtual 
mappings matter".

I halfway agree. It's fairly trivial to make x86 Mac OS X work with 
stock edk2 [1]. All you need are a few boot services, a non-standard way 
(or BootXXX variables) to find the real boot binary and APFS driver 
(binary is included in every APFS FS) load support. The rest is a fairly 
standard compliant UEFI environment.

But I'm not sure how that's relevant to the argument that we need a way 
to perform runtime service calls without relying on DMA? In addition to 
the potential VA/PA mismatch issue, relying on DMA from RTS can quickly 
also get broken for any confidential compute environments where you need 
to take explicit action to make memory visible to the hypervisor.

All I'm asking for is an (optional) viable path that works without DMA :).

For something as core as a UEFI variable service that should become the 
default in a generic platform like QEMU, I don't think we should rely on 
new additions to the UEFI spec :(. Users want to be able to run old 
Operating Systems.

The non-hacky alternative would be to expose a real 64KiB large MMIO 
window into host memory that goes through full instruction emulation for 
every access. Then we could expose it as real MMIO target memory to RTS 
which should always work. DMA can then be an (optional) optimization on 
top to copy to/from that buffer.
