I meant the -global, and the global setups via migrate-set-parameters.

As replied to Dan in the other email, I changed my mind on question (1); I
think it makes sense to have it YES.  I left my pure question on (2) there
too.

Do we really want to disable migrate-set-parameters setting most of the
parameters, and only allow it to be set during migration on a few things
like bandwidth or so?

I just don't really see the major benefit of that yet.  I would think it
make more sense if we don't need to change any parameters in migration,
then provide that in one shot in QMP migrate "config".  Maybe making more
sense if migration is not heavily thread-based but having its aiocontext so
we could even move to Jobs.

Now after all we'll need to allow setting something like bandwidth even
during migration alive, and we have all the things ready allowing to set
before migration starts, I'm not 100% sure whether we need to bother even
if it does look cleaner, because we'll still break mgmt used to be working
for years.. I could be over-cautious on breaking things, but I still want
to understand better on the benefits.

One step back, on this "allow migrate to specify 'config'" request: I think
we can definitely do that as it still provides some kind of atomicity.  But
frankly speaking I never see it a "real problem" - do we really have report
or use case showing that Libvirt can trigger "migrate" with some global
settings touched by other apps at all?

To me, it was yet an illutionary problem, I never know the answer of that.
If Libvirt is still the owner of QEMU instance via the QMP channel, I
actually don't really see why the atomicity would even help, even though we
can still provide that as it's pretty easy as something optional; like what
this patch does without too much hassle.

Then if to move one step further to remove all global settings, we face
breaking debugging scripts, and breaking of any old libvirt and non-libvirt
mgmt apps.  Frankly I really don't yet know whether it's a good idea.  I
could miss some important reasoning of why we want to do it - it needs to
be something not relevant to "making the code cleaner", IMHO..
