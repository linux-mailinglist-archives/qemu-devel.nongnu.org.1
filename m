deprecated

Regarding "marked as removed": not quite.  Its entry was moved from
docs/about/deprecated.rst to docs/about/removed-features.rst, but the
text there is "should simply be removed."

I'm not sure it fixes something that was broken.  Commit 0310641c06d
(crypto: make loaded property read-only) did what it said on the tin.
What it did was unusual, and maybe a bad idea.

Anyway, not important now.
