It is possible somehow, but multiple searches are already used in
other areas where the full range is not found in the first attempt.
First one may return a partial result, but the second one can look for
the missing part of the key (vaddr=3D0x2000, size=3D0x1000). Isn't that
simpler?

The only problem is that IOVATree is shared with intel_iommu. How to
keep modifying it without affecting IOVATree usage by intel_iommu
might be a problem.

Right. But in this RFC the id is not searched in full range, only the
first GPA of each region.
