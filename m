FYI: The no-map fix went in OpenSBI v1.3. Without the upgrade, any
user using the latest kernel (> v6.4)
may hit those random linear map related issues (in hibernation or EFI
booting path).

There are three possible scenarios:

1. Upgrade to OpenSBI v1.3: Any user of microchip-icicle-kit machine
or sifive fu540 machine users
may hit this issue if the device tree has the disabled hart (e core).
2. No upgrade to OpenSBI v1.2. Any user using hibernation or UEFI may
have issues [1]
3. Include a non-release version OpenSBI in Qemu with the fix as an excepti=
on.

#3 probably deviates from policy and sets a bad precedent. So I am not
advocating for it though ;)
For both #1 & #2, the solution would be to use the latest OpenSBI in
-bios argument instead of the stock one.
I could be wrong but my guess is the number of users facing #2 would
be higher than #1.
