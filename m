I understand there is sometimes a rationale reason behind things, and 
most of the time, historical reasons.

Indeed, and I remember reading this when I started working on QEMU, but 
not really after spending time to craft the "right" command and keep it 
in my aliases.

In general, having documentation is great, but I would still favor 
intuitive commands and defaults over a lengthy explaination or this 
email thread, but as "good defaults" and "intuitive command" is 
definitely a personal judgment, and not something objective, I'll simply 
accept the current situation and move on.
