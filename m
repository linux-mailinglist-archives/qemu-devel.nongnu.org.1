Yeah, that's exactly my thought: if something in the subsystem
has changed, esp. when the new thing is now widely used, it is
best to try to pick it up (unless it is a big change by itself
or is a part of big change).

I already mentioned a trivial fix c255946e3df4 in this thread,
which can be applied cleanly if two other no-change patches are
in, 753ae97abc7 and dadee9e3ce6.  It is much more likely to hit
conflicts in this area in future updates if such updates will
happen if such renames like these two aren't picked up.

So, right in this same patch series, there's one more very similar
change:

But all the nearby lines are touched by previous patch:

     hw/riscv/virt.c: rename MachineState 'mc' pointers to 'ms'
...
     Rename all 'mc' MachineState pointers to 'ms'. This is a very tedious
     and mechanical patch that was produced by doing the following:

     - find/replace all 'MachineState *mc' to 'MachineState *ms';
     - find/replace all 'mc->fdt' to 'ms->fdt';
     - find/replace all 'mc->smp.cpus' to 'ms->smp.cpus';
     - replace any remaining occurrences of 'mc' that the compiler complained
     about.

This patch by Daniel is a no-code-change, it really is just a rename of
variables.  I can rename variable back from ms to mc in the fix patch,
or I can apply this rename first and apply the fix patch cleanly, and
all subsequent changes will have much more chance to apply cleanly too.

What a wonderful world.. ;)

Thankfully, such cases are rare.  But we do have a few famous cases like this
still, some of which I also mentioned in the first message in this thread.
