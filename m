The 'want_zero' parameter to raw_co_block_status() was added so that
we can avoid potentially time-consuming lseek(SEEK_DATA) calls
throughout the file (working around poor filesystems that have O(n)
rather than O(1) extent probing).  But when it comes to learning if a
file is completely sparse (for example, it was just created), always
claiming that a file is all data without even checking offset 0 breaks
what would otherwise be attempts at useful optimizations for a
known-zero mirror destination.

Note that this allows file-posix to report a file as completely zero
if it was externally created (such as via 'truncate --size=$n file')
as entirely sparse; however, it does NOT work for files created
internally by blockdev-create.  That's because blockdev-create
intentionally does a sequence of truncate(0), truncate(size),
allocate_first_block(), in order to make it possible for gluster on
XFS to probe the sector size for direct I/O (which doesn't work if the
first block is sparse).  That will be addressed in a later patch.
