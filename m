Note, I've sent "[PATCH v2 00/33] qapi: docs: width=70 and two spaces between sentences", with not doubled patches (again, sorry for that :/.

That since 9d167491cb2577d "docs/devel/qapi-code-gen: Update doc comment conventions" (2023), by Markus, written in
qapi-code-gen.rst:

     For legibility, wrap text paragraphs so every line is at most 70
     characters long.

     Separate sentences with two spaces.

And I always forget it, when preparing my patches. Checking these rules during review, and than fixing is rather boring,
so, I decided to try fix them all. Assised by AI, of course... Or, maybe AI assisted by me.

If we decide, that it is too huge, we can proceed with some list of exclusions, to cover existing violations and avoid new ones.
