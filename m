That's not what this loop does. DM_MPATH_PROBE_PATHS probes all paths
and fails when no paths are available. The delay would only apply in the
case when there are no paths available.

If the point is not to wait until some path comes back, then why loop at
all?

True, if the read requests themselves time out rather than failing with
an immediate error, then no delay is required. I guess both cases can
happen and userspace has no visibility aside from measuring the time
spent in the ioctl.

Yes, it will be complex. I have no objection to this patch as-is.
