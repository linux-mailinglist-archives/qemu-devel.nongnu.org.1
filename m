I haven't thought about this before, but do note that the NBD URI spec
defers to "IETF standards describing URIs" for all unanswered
questions.  RFC3986 does talk about this incidentally.  About the
scheme field it says (section 3.1):

   Although schemes are case-
   insensitive, the canonical form is lowercase and documents that
   specify schemes must do so with lowercase letters.  An implementation
   should accept uppercase letters as equivalent to lowercase in scheme
   names (e.g., allow "HTTP" as well as "http") for the sake of
   robustness but should only produce lowercase scheme names for
   consistency.

Hostname is also (obviously) case insensitive.  There's also a section
(6.2.3) which talks about normalization of URIs.

Overall it seems the intention of the RFC writer is that parsers
should handle any case; but when generating URIs (and for examples,
documentation etc) we should only generate lowercase.

libnbd absolutely does *not* get this right, eg:

  $ nbdinfo NBD://localhost
  nbdinfo: nbd_connect_uri: unknown NBD URI scheme: NBD: Invalid argument

so that's a bug too.

We could mention this in the spec for clarity, but the current meaning
(as above) would be that case-insensitive parsing is recommended.
