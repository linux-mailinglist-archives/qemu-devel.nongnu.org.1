I'd prefer if we kept things strict. However I don't think we can do
that without having enough testing and specially, clear recipes on how
to add compatibility back once it gets lost. Think of that recent thread
were we discussed an old powerpc issue. How come we can see the fix
today in the code but cannot tell which problem it was trying to solve?
That's bonkers. Ideally every type of breakage would have a mapping into
why it breaks and how to fix it.

So with testing to catch the issue early and a clear step-by-step on how
to identify and fix compatibility, then we could require strict
compatibility for every device.

We might want to make a distinction between migration core vs. device
state testing. I see n-1 testing more like migration core testing. It's
bad to break migration, but it's really bad to break migration for
everyone because we refactored something deep within migration/.

I also wouldn't mind if we had some simple way for device developers to
add migration tests that cover their code. Currently it's infeasible to
edit migration-test with new command lines for every device of
interest. Maybe we could have a little framework that takes a command
line and spits a migration stream? Something really self-contained,
behind the device's CONFIG in meson.

Do we need migration support tiers? =)

If a machine supports KVM, that's already a good indication that we will
want to have migration working both ways.

If the machine supports only TCG, then migration will probably be a nice
to have for development, but no one would be relying on it in
production. It might be ok to only support forward migration.

Could that be a first filter to reason about this? That might narrow the
list of devices enough.
