Yup, I'm aware, but I keep thinking that we'll only be using profiles with
a base cpu type. If you start with nothing (a base) and then add a profile
and take the same one away, you shouldn't be taking away anything else. I
agree that if you use a profile on some cpu type that already enabled a
bunch of stuff itself, then disabling a profile would potentially remove
some of those too, but mixing cpu types that have their own extensions and
profiles seems like a great way to confuse oneself as to what extensions
will be present.  IOW, we should be adding a base cpu type at the same
time we're adding these profiles.

It will be consistent if we always override whatever was on the left with
what's on the right, which means with

 -cpu rv64,rva22u64=true -cpu rv64,zicbom=false

zicbom will be disabled, but with

 -cpu rv64,zicbom=false -cpu rv64,rva22u64=true

it will be enabled. The same goes if the properties are given to the same
-cpu parameter.

Yup, sounds good.
