Understood, thank you.  As per Thomas' comment, I did not do my due
diligence to check the QEMU release schedule.  My comment does not make
sense anyway, since 9.1 is not even released.  I will remove it `note`
entirely.

Apologies for all of this confusion, and I appreciate your patience.

I will post v3 with the appropriate corrections.
