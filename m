IMHO this significantly undermines the protection offered. fork(), without
execve() is relatively benign from a security POV, mostly a slightly greater
resource consumption issue, compared to spawning threads, which is always
allowed. Blocking execve() is the key security benefit, as that is a way to
pick up new privileges (through setuid), or bring new binary code into
memory (via the new ELF images loaded), or pick up new MAC policy through
transition rules, etc.

IOW, if you're going to allow 'exec', there's little point in blocking fork
IMHO, and as such this doesn't sound very appealing as something to add to
libvirt.

With regards,
Daniel
