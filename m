That is insufficient as it does not take account of device hotplug.

Libvirt records the full details of the guest configuration required to
reproduce the exact same guest ABI, even across device hotplug. This is
why libvirt QEMU command lines are absolutely enourmous compared to
minimalist command lines that users usuall run directly.
