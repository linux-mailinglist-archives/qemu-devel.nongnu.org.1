For legibility, wrap text paragraphs so every line is at most 70
characters long.

To check the generated documentation does not change, I compared the
generated HTML before and after this commit with "wdiff -3".  Finds no
differences.  Comparing with diff is not useful, as the refilled
paragraphs are visible there.
