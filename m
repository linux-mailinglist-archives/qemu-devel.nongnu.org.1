Yeah it's not nice that we can't use it in static/const initializers.

It has its pros and cons that's for sure... there are many crates that
let you define typed bitfields, I haven't looked into the current
state of the art lately. We should definitely move on to something
better if it exists now or in the future.

Oops, I forgot I had archived it because I moved development to
https://gitlab.com/epilys/qemu . I made it public again. Bear in mind
this was a WIP, basically my git stash but committed.
