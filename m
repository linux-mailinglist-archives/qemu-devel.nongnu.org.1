Convert blkdebug.txt to rST format.  We put it into index-build.rst
because it falls under the "test" part of "QEMU Build and Test
System".

At least, index-build seemed the most plausible home to me...

+Block I/O error injection using ``blkdebug``
+============================================
+
+..
+   Copyright (C) 2014-2015 Red Hat Inc
+
+   This work is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL, version 2 or later.  See
+   the COPYING file in the top-level directory.
+
+The ``blkdebug`` block driver is a rule-based error injection engine.  It can be
+used to exercise error code paths in block drivers including ``ENOSPC`` (out of
+space) and ``EIO``.
+
+This document gives an overview of the features available in ``blkdebug``.
+
+Background
+----------
+Block drivers have many error code paths that handle I/O errors.  Image formats
+are especially complex since metadata I/O errors during cluster allocation or
+while updating tables happen halfway through request processing and require
+discipline to keep image files consistent.
+
+Error injection allows test cases to trigger I/O errors at specific points.
+This way, all error paths can be tested to make sure they are correct.
+
+Rules
+-----
+The ``blkdebug`` block driver takes a list of "rules" that tell the error injection
+engine when to fail an I/O request.
+
+Each I/O request is evaluated against the rules.  If a rule matches the request
+then its "action" is executed.
+
+Rules can be placed in a configuration file; the configuration file
+follows the same .ini-like format used by QEMU's ``-readconfig`` option, and
+each section of the file represents a rule.
+
+The following configuration file defines a single rule::
+
+  $ cat blkdebug.conf
+  [inject-error]
+  event = "read_aio"
+  errno = "28"
+
+This rule fails all aio read requests with ``ENOSPC`` (28).  Note that the errno
+value depends on the host.  On Linux, see
+``/usr/include/asm-generic/errno-base.h`` for errno values.
+
+Invoke QEMU as follows::
+
+  $ qemu-system-x86_64
+        -drive if=none,cache=none,file=blkdebug:blkdebug.conf:test.img,id=drive0 \
+        -device virtio-blk-pci,drive=drive0,id=virtio-blk-pci0
+
+Rules support the following attributes:
+
+``event``
+  which type of operation to match (e.g. ``read_aio``, ``write_aio``,
+  ``flush_to_os``, ``flush_to_disk``).  See `Events`_ for
+  information on events.
+
+``state``
+  (optional) the engine must be in this state number in order for this
+  rule to match.  See `State transitions`_ for information
+  on states.
+
+``errno``
+  the numeric errno value to return when a request matches this rule.
+  The errno values depend on the host since the numeric values are not
+  standardized in the POSIX specification.
+
+``sector``
+  (optional) a sector number that the request must overlap in order to
+  match this rule
+
+``once``
+  (optional, default ``off``) only execute this action on the first
+  matching request
+
+``immediately``
+  (optional, default ``off``) return a NULL ``BlockAIOCB``
+  pointer and fail without an errno instead.  This
+  exercises the code path where ``BlockAIOCB`` fails and the
+  caller's ``BlockCompletionFunc`` is not invoked.
+
+Events
+------
+Block drivers provide information about the type of I/O request they are about
+to make so rules can match specific types of requests.  For example, the ``qcow2``
+block driver tells ``blkdebug`` when it accesses the L1 table so rules can match
+only L1 table accesses and not other metadata or guest data requests.
+
+The core events are:
+
+``read_aio``
+  guest data read
+
+``write_aio``
+  guest data write
+
+``flush_to_os``
+  write out unwritten block driver state (e.g. cached metadata)
+
+``flush_to_disk``
+  flush the host block device's disk cache
+
+See ``qapi/block-core.json:BlkdebugEvent`` for the full list of events.
+You may need to grep block driver source code to understand the
+meaning of specific events.
+
+State transitions
+-----------------
+There are cases where more power is needed to match a particular I/O request in
+a longer sequence of requests.  For example::
+
+  write_aio
+  flush_to_disk
+  write_aio
+
+How do we match the 2nd ``write_aio`` but not the first?  This is where state
+transitions come in.
+
+The error injection engine has an integer called the "state" that always starts
+initialized to 1.  The state integer is internal to ``blkdebug`` and cannot be
+observed from outside but rules can interact with it for powerful matching
+behavior.
+
+Rules can be conditional on the current state and they can transition to a new
+state.
+
+When a rule's "state" attribute is non-zero then the current state must equal
+the attribute in order for the rule to match.
+
+For example, to match the 2nd write_aio::
+
+  [set-state]
+  event = "write_aio"
+  state = "1"
+  new_state = "2"
+
+  [inject-error]
+  event = "write_aio"
+  state = "2"
+  errno = "5"
+
+The first ``write_aio`` request matches the ``set-state`` rule and transitions from
+state 1 to state 2.  Once state 2 has been entered, the ``set-state`` rule no
+longer matches since it requires state 1.  But the ``inject-error`` rule now
+matches the next ``write_aio`` request and injects ``EIO`` (5).
+
+State transition rules support the following attributes:
+
+``event``
+  which type of operation to match (e.g. ``read_aio``, ``write_aio``,
+  ``flush_to_os`, ``flush_to_disk``).  See `Events`_ for
+  information on events.
+
+``state``
+  (optional) the engine must be in this state number in order for this
+  rule to match
+
+``new_state``
+  transition to this state number
+
+Suspend and resume
+------------------
+Exercising code paths in block drivers may require specific ordering amongst
+concurrent requests.  The "breakpoint" feature allows requests to be halted on
+a ``blkdebug`` event and resumed later.  This makes it possible to achieve
+deterministic ordering when multiple requests are in flight.
+
+Breakpoints on ``blkdebug`` events are associated with a user-defined ``tag`` string.
+This tag serves as an identifier by which the request can be resumed at a later
+point.
+
+See the ``qemu-io(1)`` ``break``, ``resume``, ``remove_break``, and ``wait_break``
+commands for details.
