You're right.  Cross-eyed, I guess %-}

Yes.

I found a few more paragraphs to reflow for reasons other than long
lines, a few extra blank lines, a few missing blank lines, and slightly
off indentation in a few places.  None of this I expect your code to
catch.

I found a few errors in your patch, like this one in PATCH 13:

They made me feel useful ;)

I also found a few single spaces that should be double.  Maybe the code
could be improved to catch them.

I figure code in examples should be treated just like "real" code.

Avoiding long prose lines is easy.  When I reflowed the entire QAPI
schema documentation to stay within the limit (commit a937b6aa739), not
a single line break was awkward.

Code is unlike prose: it's often more deeply indented, and it contains
more longer words (identifiers).  Because of that, a long code line can
be less bad than an awkward line break.  Use your judgement.

devel/style.rst thus advises:

    Line width
    =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

    Lines should be 80 characters; try not to make them longer.

    Sometimes it is hard to do, especially when dealing with QEMU subsystems
    that use long function or symbol names. If wrapping the line at 80 colu=
mns
    is obviously less readable and more awkward, prefer not to wrap it; bet=
ter
    to have an 85 character line than one which is awkwardly wrapped.

    Even in that case, try not to make lines much longer than 80 characters.
    (The checkpatch script will warn at 100 characters, but this is intended
    as a guard against obviously-overlength lines, not a target.)
