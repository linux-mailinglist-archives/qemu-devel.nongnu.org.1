This is no different than live migration, requiring a management agent to
launch target qemu with all the arguments use to start source QEMU.  Now that
same agent will send the arguments via cpr-exec-command.

Not yet, but I will measure it.

We'll see, but in any case these take < 100 msec, which is a wonderfully short
pause time unless your customer is doing high speed stock trading.  If cpr-transfer
is faster still, that's gravy, but cpr-exec is still great.

Yes, there is an O(n) effect here, but it is a fast O(n) when the memory is
backed by huge pages.  In UEK, we make it faster still by unmapping in parallel
with multiple threads.  I don't have the data handy but can share after running
some experiments.  Regardless, this time is negligible for small and medium
size guests, which form the majority of instances in a cloud.

Perhaps.  I view the chardev preservation as nice to have, but not essential.
It does not appear in this series, other than in docs.  It's easy to implement
given the CPR foundation.  I suggest we continue this discussion when I post
the chardev series, so we can focus on the core functionality.

It's about reserving memory and CPUs, and transferring those reservations from
the old instance to the new, and fiddling with the OS mechanisms that enforce
reservations and limits.  The devil is in the details, and with the exec model,
the management agent can ignore all of that.

You don't see it as a huge improvement because you don't need to write the
management code.  I do!

Both modes are valid and useful - exec in container, or launch a new container.
I have volunteered to implement the cpr-transfer mode for the latter, a mode
I do not use.  Please don't reward me by dropping the mode I care about :)
Both modes can co-exist.  The presence of the cpr-exec specific code in qemu
will not hinder future live migration development.

chardev preservation.  The qemu socket chardevs to these agents are preserved,
and the agent connections to the outside world do not change, so no one sees
any interruption of traffic.

Indeed.
