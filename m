If the granules are s1=64k, s2=4k, the only way we get a cached entry as
(IOVA 0x30000, tg=4k) would be for s2 and level-3 as for level-2 it has
to be aligned with 0x200000

So when we look up for 0x31000, there is no entry for it anyway.

But I can see some problems here:
In case also s1 granule is 64k, s2 granule is 4k
- Translation A: 0x31000
- TLB is empty => PTW, entry s1 =  64k 0x30000, s2 = 4k, 0x30000 and
  the cached entry would be 0x30000,tg=4k as the combine logic also
  uses the aligned address
- Translation B: 0x31000 => also misses as the only cached entry
  is 0x30000, 4k

I think this is actually a bug and not just a TLB inefficiency, I need
to think more about it, but my initial thought is not to align the
iova until it’s used by a stage so it can use its granule.

Ah, that’s a bug, I will fix it, NESTED should use stage-1 granule.

Thanks for pointing that out, I will think more about it but I sense
that we would need to modify where we align the iova, for translation
and lookup.
