That is not all that different from an "Intel" device showing up
in my "AMD" guest, or that my "modern" virt guest is exposing an
Intel machine board from 2005, or that what we advertize as a
"q35" machine is actually a "p35" machine, or many other wierd
virt things.

If we're a mmgmt app provisioning a guest, we have to choose what
watchdog to create - either the old one which works everywhere
that currently has a driver, or the new one will will work in
far fewer places. We'll have to wire up guest OS info about
watchdogs into osinfo, and then wire up all the mgmt apps to
query this and take action based off it. All possible, but it
still feels like a huge waste of time to me.

Daniel
