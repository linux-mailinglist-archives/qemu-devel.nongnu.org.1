I see.

Can you make an argument why the reason for RCU draining does not apply
in failover_add_primary()?

If it doesn't apply, capturing the argument in a comment would be nice.

If it does apply, a FIXME comment seems in order.

Also, RCU draining / BQL dropping vs. non-draining/dropping behavior of
non-static functions should be documented in function comments.

All this can be done on top.

Makes sense.
