AMD hasn't supported that leaf in QEMU (cpu_x86_cpuid()).

Igor's concern is right, as there is no way to ensure how the software
will behave (just like Windows doesn't respect the x86 spec). It is
least risky to consider this property as the 1st category, because the
particular CPU model supports this leaf, and software that runs
properly on the corresponding bare metal certainly won't complain about
0x1f or even prefer to have 0x1f in Guest (also as in your Windows
example).

Disable "cpuid-0x1f-enforce" by default is also fine for me. If you find
it's not easy to add 0x1f for the CPU models, I can add 0x1f into CPU
models in the future with my other cache model work, to help you fill in
the last piece that Igor suggested.

Zhao
