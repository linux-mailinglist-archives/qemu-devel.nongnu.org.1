It would be per new model and right now there are only a handful of
bits that have to be blocked; so it wouldn't be particularly bad.

It's a common way to launch a guest if you're not interested in
migration (which is obviously the case for SNP right now), so it's
more like "why not". :)

Yeah, and if you mix that with knowledge of what KVM can/cannot
virtualize that doesn't exist in the processor (which isn't that
much), then you end up with something a lot like patch 2

It would be nice if the policy enforcement were changed to allow the
TSC deadline timer and X2APIC bits (you probably don't want TSC
adjust, that's the right call; and virt SSBD is not accessible because
you use V_SPEC_CTRL instead). But then there would be no way to find
out if the change actually happened.

Yep, I think I'll include that patch as the maintainability doesn't seem ba=
d.
