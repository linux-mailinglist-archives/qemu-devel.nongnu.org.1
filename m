ARM should have that too now, if that's what you're talking about.

Said that, for quite some time I was wondering whether upstream should be
focused on some solution that will work out for convergence, where I
ultimately chose postcopy.  That's also why I was asking whether you
considered postcopy.

It'll be more focused for everyone if we can have one major solution over
this problem rather than spreading the energy over a few.

If we want to do some change here anyway, I'd think it better we do it in
the best form rather than keep adding caps.

For now "stick with postcopy" is still one way to go, but not sure whether
it applies in your setup.  Otherwise I'd consider we sync more for huge
VMs.  I mean "throttle only for each sync, sync for each iteration" may
make sense in the old days, but perhaps not anymore.  That sound like the
real root cause of this issue.
