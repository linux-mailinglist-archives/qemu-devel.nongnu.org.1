Good to hear that you will be around!

I leave it to you whether you want to add yourself as reviewer of patches to
MAINTAINER's 9pfs section.

For other things like adding a virtio-9pfs-freebsd subsection or something,
it's probably a bit too early.

Both ways are fine with me in this case. Do as you find appropriate.

Yeah, that was on nit level as well. It's fine to leave the name, as FreeBSD
is currently the only supported one.

Ah, I was misinterpreting your comment as if it were "racily defining" the
macros. Maybe change the comment to something like "... can only emulate their
intended behaviour (racily) ...".

Thanks!
