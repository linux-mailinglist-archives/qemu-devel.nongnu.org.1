The host admin can merely shuffle workloads around, hoping that
a different packing of workloads onto machines, will reduce power
in some aount. You might win a few %, or low 10s of % with this
if you're good at it.

The guest admin can change the way their workload operates to
reduce its inherant power consumption baseline. You could easily
come across ways to win high 10s of % with this. That's why it
is interesting to expose power consumption info to the guest
admin.

IOW, neither makes the other obsolete, both approaches are
desirable.

There's a tradeoff here in that info directly associated with
backends threads, is effectively exposing private QEMU impl
details as public ABI. IOW, we don't want too fine granularity
here, we need it abstracted sufficiently, that different
backend choices for a given don't change what sensors are
exposed.

I also wonder how existing power monitoring applications
would consume such custom sensors - is there sufficient
standardization in this are that we're not inventing
something totally QEMU specific ?

Note, this feature is already released in QEMU 9.1.0.

IMHO the so called "pure" form is misleading to applications, unless
we first provided  some other pratical way to expose the data that
we would be throwing away from RAPL.
