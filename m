Another thought or two...

From a QEMU community POV we have no license problem no matter what,
so from a legal POV this risk free for us.

The licensing question is purely one for application developers consuming
our work who want to avoid GPL for some reason.

Lets say my interpretation is wrong, or even that it is right, but the
app developers disagree, or are none the less unhappy in some way. What
impact would this have for QEMU ?

Code generation is practically free once the generator is written, so we
just run it twice, storing the output in git on different branches with
parallel tags, once with comments and once without. eg

The "main" branch (and associated versioned vX.Y.Z tags) in qemu-go-qapi.git
provide the full QAPI go source + copied QAPI comments under MIT-0 AND
GPL-2.0-or-later

The "minimal" branch (and associated vX.Y.Z-minimal tags) in qemu-go-qapi.git
provide only the  QAPI go source, without any comments under MIT-0 only.



With regards,
Daniel
