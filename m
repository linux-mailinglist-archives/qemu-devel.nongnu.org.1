Informally we have approximately three groups of platforms

 * Tier 1: fully built and fully tested by CI. Must always be
           kept working & regressions fixed immediately

 * Tier 2: fully built and partially tested by CI. Should
           always be kept working & regressions fixed quickly

 * Tier 3: code exists but is not built or tested by CI.
           Should not be intentionally broken but not
	   guaranteed to work at any time. Downstream must
	   manually test, report & fix bugs.

Anything else is "unclassified" and any historical code
remnants may be removed.

It is somewhat tricky to define unambiguous rules for each tier,
but this doc takes a stab at it. We don't need to cover every
eventuality. If we get the core points of view across, then it
at least sets the direction for maintainers/contributors/users.
Other aspects can be inferred with greater accuracy than today.

This came out of the discussion about recent unnoticed breakage
in NetBSD builds and what maintainers are expected todo about
it (if anything)

+OS Support Tiers
+----------------
+
+While the QEMU code targets a number of different OS platforms, they don't
+all get the same level of support from the project. This applies to
+contributor & maintainer expectations, CI automation and requirements
+for merge gating.
+
+Tier 1
+~~~~~~
+
+These platforms attain the highest level of quality offered by
+the QEMU project.
+
+ * Builds and all tests pass at all times in both git HEAD and releases
+
+ * Builds for multiple build configuration are integrated in CI
+
+ * Runs all available tests frameworks (unit, qtest, iotests, functional)
+   in CI
+
+ * Merging code is gated on successful CI jobs
+
+This covers
+
+ * Linux (x86_64, aarch64, s390x)
+
+Responsibilities:
+
+ * Contributors MUST test submitted patches on one of Tier 1 platforms.
+
+ * Contributors SHOULD test submitted patches on Tier 1 platforms
+   by running a GitLab CI pipeline in their fork.
+
+ * Maintainers MUST request contributors to fix problems with Tier 1
+   platforms.
+
+ * Maintainers MUST test pull requests on Tier 1 platforms
+   by running a GitLab CI pipeline in their fork.
+
+ * Maintainers MUST co-ordinate fixing regressions identified
+   post-merge immediately.
+
+
+Tier 2
+~~~~~~
+
+These platforms are considered to be near Tier 1 level, but are
+lacking sufficient automated CI testing cover to guarantee this.
+
+ * Builds and all tests pass at all times in both git HEAD and releases
+
+ * Builds for multiple build configuration are integrated in CI
+
+ * Runs some test frameworks in CI
+
+This covers
+
+ * Linux (mips64el, ppc64el, riscv64)
+
+ * FreeBSD (x86_64)
+
+ * macOS (aarch64)
+
+ * Windows (x86_64)
+
+Responsibilities:
+
+ * Contributors MAY test patches on Tier 2 platforms
+   by running a GitLab CI pipeline in their fork
+
+ * Maintainers SHOULD request contributors to fix problems with Tier 2
+   platforms.
+
+ * Maintainers MUST test pull requests on all Tier 2 platforms,
+   by running a GitLab CI pipeline in their fork.
+
+ * Maintainers MUST co-ordinate fixing regressions identified
+   post-merge quickly.
+
+
+Tier 3
+~~~~~~
+
+These platforms have theoretical support in the code, but have
+little, or no, automated build and test coverage. Downstream
+consumers (users or distributors) who care about these platforms
+are requested to perform manual testing, report bugs and provide
+patches.
+
+ * Builds and tests may be broken at any time in Git HEAD and
+   releases
+
+ * Builds are not integrated into CI
+
+ * Tests are not integrated into CI
+
+ * Merging code is not gated
+
+This covers:
+
+ * NetBSD
+ * OpenBSD
+ * macOS (except aarch64)
+ * FreeBSD (except x86_64)
+ * Windows (except x86_64)
+ * Solaris
+
+Responsibilities:
+
+ * Contributors MAY test patches on Tier 3 platforms manually
+
+ * Maintainers MAY request contributors to fix problems
+   on Tier 3 platforms
+
+ * Maintainers MAY test patches on Tier 3 platforms manually
+
+ * Maintainers SHOULD NOT accept patches that remove code
+   targetting Tier 3 platforms even if currently broken
+
+ * Downstream vendors SHOULD test RC releases on Tier 3 platforms
+   and provide bug reports and patches to address problems
+
+Note: if a Tier 3 platform is found to be significantly broken,
+no patches are contributed for a prolonged period, and there is
+no sign of downstream usage, it is liable to be moved to
+"Unclassified" and thus be subject to removal.
+
+
+Unclassified
+~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+These platforms are not intended to be supported in the code
+and outside the scope of any support tiers.
+
+  * Code supporting these platforms can removed at any time
+  * Bugs reports related to these platforms will generally
+    be ignored
+
+This covers:
+
+ * All 32-bit architectures on any OS
+ * Any OS not listed above
+
+Responsibilities:
+
+ * Maintainers MAY decline patches that add code targetting
+   unclassified platforms
+
+ * Maintainers MAY accept patches that remove code targetting
+   unclassified platforms
