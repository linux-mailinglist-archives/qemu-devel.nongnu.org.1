Ah..

How about one more change on top of above change to disconnect properly for
TLS?  Something like gnutls_bye() in qio_channel_tls_close(), would that
make sense to you?

In general, I think it'll be good we fix this from the source rather than
bypassing an error reported by gnutls facilities. We'll see what we can do
to help (this includes Fabiano), but the hope is we can figure out the
right way soon.

Thanks,
