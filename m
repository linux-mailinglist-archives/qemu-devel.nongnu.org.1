Ha, so it STARTED parsing console= and broke. Oops. (It was there so I'd 
notice...)

I'm happy to do it the "right" way if I know what that is. I just 
stumbled around and got it to work.

I'm attempting to regression test as many targets as I can to get 
consistent basic behavior out of:

   https://landley.net/bin/mkroot/0.8.11/

I'm trying to get a new release out with the 6.12 kernel which is why 
I'm revisiting this now.

I've even got a test script that runs all the targets under qemu 
(booting them in parallel even) and checks that A) they boot and run 
userspace, B) they can talk to an emulated hard disk, C) they can talk 
to an emulated network, D) the clock gets set reasonably, E) it knows 
how to exit the emulator. You'd be surprised how many regressions there 
are in just that...

Speaking of which, is there a way to get or1k to exit the emulator? I 
told the kernel to reboot but it says "reboot failed, system halted" and 
hangs instead of exiting qemu. (My testroot runs qemu under "timeout -i 
10" to kill it after 10 seconds of inactivity, I.E. nothing written to 
stdout, but it still counts as a failure on one of the criteria.)

Happy to do it properly. Almost all the other targets can do console=, 
the FIXME was there to highlight the fact it didn't work right. 
(Silently working for the WRONG REASON is still bad when regression 
testing.)

Most of the other targets _don't_ use builtin initramfs, so you can swap 
them out "aftermarket" as it were. When it's separate you can examine 
and edit the contents without rebuilding the kernel...

I updated my mkroot config:

   https://github.com/landley/toybox/commit/fb3ca98e2faa

I.E. changed the FIXME to ttyS0, removed BUILTIN=1 so it's no longer 
statically linking the initramfs image, and yanked the builtin DTB, and 
the result works with v9.2.0-rc1.

Still doesn't know how to exit qemu, though. (Is there a kernel symbol I 
can add to 6.12, or does qemu still not have an exit mechanism for this 
board yet?)

(FYI: be2csv is a shell function to convert bash's brace expansion 
syntax to a comma separated value list, and then csv2cfg is another 
shell function that turns the CSV into https://lwn.net/Articles/160497/ 
. The CSV is shipped as docs/linux-microconfig in the tarball if you're 
curious. That's how a 400 line bash script can build a Linux system that 
boots to a shell prompt for a dozen architectures. The or1k config is 
now 2 lines, for example. 3 with the "if or1k" check. The variables it 
assigns to are documented around line 190.)

I specify it explicitly to be consistent across architectures.

Yup, I just had to remove workarounds for old qemu that are no longer 
needed. Thanks for the help. (If you do teach qemu to exit at some 
point, please let me know...)
