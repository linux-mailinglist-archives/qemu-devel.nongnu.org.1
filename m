Good catch! This is a left-over from an earlier version. Now that the
bitmap shall be used as the working bitmap, it cannot be read-only. I'll
change it to BDRV_BITMAP_DEFAULT in v3 of the series.

The issue here is (in particular) present when the target does COW, i.e.
in qcow2 diff images, allocated clusters which end up with partial data,
when we don't have the right cluster size. Patch 4/4 adds the check for
the target's cluster size.

I don't think so. How should we know if the target already contains data
from a previous full sync or not?

Those caveats when using diff images are unfortunate, and users should
be warned about them of course, but the main/expected use case for the
feature is to sync to the same target multiple times, so I'd hope the
cluster size check in patch 4/4 and mentioning the edge cases in the
documentation is enough here.

It's true for any provided bitmap: it will be disabled when the mirror
job starts, because we manually set it in bdrv_mirror_top_do_write() and
then in mirror_exit_common(), the bitmap will be enabled.

Okay, I'll require that it is enabled at the beginning.

Thank you for the review!
