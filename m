How are you going to make this one work? 'migration-test --level 3'
vs. 'migration-test --level 3 -m slow' vs. 'migration-test -m slow'

The only way I can see is to not have a level 3 at all and just use -m
slow.

I'm not sure that works semantically for level 4. Because the reason one
runs flaky tests is different from the reason one runs the other
tests. So we probably don't want to run a bunch of tests just to get to
the broken ones.

But we don't need to spend too much time on this. I hate the idea of
flaky tests anyway. Whatever we choose they'll just sit there doing
nothing.

This is not right. Checking /dev/kvm at configure time doesn't ensure it
will be present at test runtime. It also doesn't account for builds with
CONFIG_KVM=n or builds without both KVM and TCG. This needs to be done
inside the test.

I think the best we can do is have a qtest_migration_level_<ARCH> and
set it for every arch.

Also note that we must keep plain 'migration-test' invocation working
because of the compat test.
