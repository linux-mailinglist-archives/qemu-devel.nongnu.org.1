Error reporting from gnutls was improved by:

  commit 57941c9c86357a6a642f9ee3279d881df4043b6d
  Author: Daniel P. Berrangé <berrange@redhat.com>
  Date:   Fri Mar 15 14:07:58 2024 +0000

    crypto: push error reporting into TLS session I/O APIs

This has the effect of changing the output from one of the NBD
tests.

Reported-by: Thomas Huth <thuth@redhat.com>

NB, wrt qemu-stable this will be for the 9.1 stable branch once
that is created, no earlier releases will need this.
