The thing that made QEMU pick 0x90000300 as the first serial
terminal is that the current code
 (1) loops through calling openrisc_sim_serial_init() starting
     lowest address first and
 (2) calls "serial_hd(OR1KSIM_UART_COUNT - uart_idx - 1)"
     to get the QEMU chardev.

If you do that then the uart that gets serial_hd(0) is 0x90000300.
This is completely unrelated to the order of nodes in the dtb,
or to any logic that the guest uses to select a UART: it's what
means that if the user only passes one "-serial foo" that's the
UART they're configuring. It happens that if the guest code
is doing the "pick the first node in the DTB" then the current
code will give them the UART that QEMU thinks of as the "first"
serial port. But if the guest code is doing any of a bunch of
other reasonable things then it will pick a UART that isn't what
QEMU is currently calling the "first" serial port.

 We want all of these to be true:
 * serial_hd(0) is the lowest-address UART
 * serial_hd(0) is listed first in the DTB
 * serial_hd(0) is the /chosen/stdout-path one
 * the /aliases/serial0 alias points at serial_hd(0)
   (and then up in ascending order for serial1, etc)

(I would probably reword the commit message a bit to make it
clear that this is what we're trying to achieve and what we
think the commit does.)

thanks
