Hmm. Now I'm a bit confused.

Initially I thought it's just this patch, 1/3, "target/hppa: Fix OS reboot issues",
to which I replied, is the one which should perhaps go to -stable.  But now I see
it is the whole series, all 3 changes, which are needed.

And for 7.2, things are a bit more interesting in this context: seabios-hppa version
in 7.2 is 6, it changed to version 7 in qemu 8.0, and changed further by this patchset.
There isn't much differences between seabios-hppa 6 and 7, so it's probably okay to
have it of version 7 in qemu-7.2-stable too (esp. since the change in there is another
bugfix, with debian 12 as a reproducer).

So, just to confirm: do we update seabios-hppa to this commit 673d2595d4f773cc266cbf
(version 8) in both stable-7.2 and stable-8.0? :)

The changes in there seems to be okay anyway, should be good to have in -stable.

Besides, I'm having sort of difficult time cherry-picking the commit which updates
seabios-hppa submodule and hppa-firmware.img file, - git tells me there's a conflict
(even when applying to stable-8.0 branch) but I see no changes to this areas in-
between (yes, a conflict when applying to 7.2 is expected).  So I ended up in
doing:

staging-8.0$ git cherry-pick -xs 34ec3aea54368a92b62a55c656335885ba8c65ef

Recursive merging with submodules currently only supports trivial cases.
Please manually handle the merging of each conflicted submodule.
This can be accomplished with the following steps:
  - go to submodule (roms/seabios-hppa), and either merge commit 673d2595
    or update to an existing commit which has merged those changes
  - come back to superproject and run:

       git add roms/seabios-hppa

    to record the above merge or update
  - resolve any other conflicts in the superproject
  - commit the resulting index in the superproject

Yes, this moves us to the right contents of both the submodule and the binary
file (the same as on master), but I don't see why it goes the way it goes.


Besides, it looks like this is the first change to submodules within qemu-stable
series..


Thanks,
