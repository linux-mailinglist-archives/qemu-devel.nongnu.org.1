Mmm. I think there's a difference between:
 * we think this category of AI generated changes is
   sufficiently low-risk to the project and sufficiently
   useful to be worth awarding it an exception
and
 * we think that this category of AI generated changes
   is one we can't trust contributors not to just send
   in anyway, so we give it an exception in the hope they
   might at least tell us when they're doing it

The commit message for this patch is making the first
argument; if we really think that, that's fine, but I
don't think we should make the change with the former
argument as justification if really we're doing it
because we're worried about the second. And I'm definitely
sceptical that we should change our policy just because
we think people are going to deliberately breach it if
we do not...

thanks
