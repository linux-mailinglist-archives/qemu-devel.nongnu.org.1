Live migration can fail if dirty memory copy does not converge.  CPR does not.
cpr-transfer can fail if it fails to create a new container.  cpr-exec cannot.
cpr-transfer can fail to allocate resources.  cpr-exec needs less.

cpr-exec failure is almost always due to a QEMU bug.  For example, a new feature
has been added to new QEMU, and is *not* forced to false in a compatibility entry
for the old machine model. We do our best to find and fix those before going into
production. In production, the success rate is high. That is one reason I like the
mode so much.

Question 2 is about minimizing downtime by starting new QEMU while old QEMU
is still running.  That is true, but the savings are small.

mgmt re-sends the hot plug commands to the qemu monitor.  Same as for live
migration.

That also works, and is a technique I have used to reduce guest pause time.

That is up to the mgmt layer, to know how QEMU was originally started, and
what has been hot plugged afterwards.  The fast qom-list-get command that
I recently added can help here.
