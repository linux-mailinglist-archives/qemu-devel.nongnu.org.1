A deliberate approach to explore some before we go all in could mitigate
the risk of taking on too much technical debt.

We obviously need to write instances of each interesting class of things
to ferret out the problems, and design good interfaces.  I'd recommend
to write few instances, ideally one, then let them mature some before we
create many more of them.  Prioritize gaining experience over quantity.
