Good to know I'm not the only one thinking that.

It's okay - after your cleanup it's much better at least to me.  The only
thing to avoid these, AFAIU, is more careful design level reviews in the
future, and more documents state the facts and keep in history (and
obviously why remove-fd was needed was not documented).  Now we carry them.
