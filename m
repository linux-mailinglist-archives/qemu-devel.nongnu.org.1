It's not a bad series, unfortunately. I replied with my own comments
and I stand by them.

I don't mind if you want to drop the #ifdef (which shows how a flag
could be used and the code-size impact). But other than that, I am
firm on this for now. I've already applied it to my tree and a membuf
implementation with tests and without a power-of-two limitation is
important for my current work on distros and expo.

As you know there have been many arguments from the EFI guys about
sandbox and you have already rejected my sandbox-focussed EFI-memory
series for your tree. If I were actually a guru, that wouldn't have
happened.

I see that Jerome has created some tests, which is good.

So really, you should consider applying the full PXE series so that
Jerome can build on that and add support for non-CMDLINE PXE in lwip
in a way that you would like.

OK I sent a PR.

OK. I am finding it more and more slow and painful. Since we are
talking about Patchwork, I noticed some patches assigned to me in
there, so I've assigned them to you. I'll try to look there more
often.

Simon
