I've had a look at what bits of the QMP schema are depending on the
above defines which libvirt uses.

In many cases libvirt could restrict the use of given command/property
to only supported architectures. We decided to simply probe the presence
of the command because it's convenient to not have to filter them any
more

- query-gic-capabilities
    - libvirt already calls this only for ARM guests based on the
      definition

- query-sev and friends
  - libvirt uses presence of 'query-sev' to decide if the binary
    supports it; patching in a platofrm check is possible although
    inconvenient

- query-sgx and friends
  - similar to sev

-query-cpu-definitions and friends
  - see below

Indeed and libvirt already uses this in few cases as noded above.

I wonder how this will work if libvirt is probing a binary. Libvirt does
not look at the filename. It can't because it can be a
user-specified/compiled binary, override script, or a distro that chose
to rename the binary.

The second thing that libvirt does after 'query-version' is
'query-target'.

So what should libvirt do once multiple targets are supported?

How do we query CPUs for each of the supported targets?

Will the result be the same if we query them one at a time or all at
once?

As noted filename will not work. Users can specify any filename and
create override scripts or rename the binary.

Ah I see you had a similar question :D
