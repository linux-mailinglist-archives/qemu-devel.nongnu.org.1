It is a regression in 10.0.4 indeed.  But it already lasted for
2 stable releases (10.0.4 & 10.0.5).  So by reverting the above
mentioned two changes in 10.0.6, we'll make yet another regression,
now when migrating from 10.0.[45] to 10.0.6. This is why I thought
it might be an idea to keep just one regression in 10.0.x, so to
say.  Especially since these changes already fixes issues with
existing guests, so by reverting them, we'll bring them back to
10.0.x.

It is an either-or combination.  It is not bad either way, I'm just
thinking what is best currently.

And with my limited understanding of the migration issue in the context
(for which I asked for clarification some 5 or 6 times already), it
feels to me like "pretending" these above 2 mentioned above patches has
always been part of 10.0.x, - declare that migration wont work from
10.0.[1-3] (or [1-5]?) to subsequent versions, and be done with it.

And modify the 2 properties introduced by:

6529f31e0d target/i386: add compatibility property for pdcm feature
e9efa4a771 target/i386: add compatibility property for arch_capabilities

to be part of pc_compat_9_2 machine, not 10.0..

Hopefully it's understandable what I mean.

Again, I asked about this some 5 times already, with no single

Ugh.  Confusion++ :)  As you wrote yourself right above, "Paolo added
compat options in pc_compat_10_0, so it should be picked up to stable
10.1".  This point "2" is exactly this case I'm talking about.  Two
commits:

6529f31e0d target/i386: add compatibility property for pdcm feature
e9efa4a771 target/i386: add compatibility property for arch_capabilities

should be picked up for 10.1.x.

This "2" point is not (yet) about 10.0.x.

For 10.0, there are 2 either-or options: either we revert, or we
pretend these has always been in 10.0.x and compensate, like I described
in my previous email in this thread (to which you're replying) and
re-describing now.

It's a good (hopefully) lesson for me myself, - I blindly picked up
a change which felt like an innocent (I even mentioned that in a commit
- it's a "cleanup patch") - just so a subsequent change in this area
applies cleanly.  But it wasn't a cleanup, and it wasn't trivial at
all.  So I must be much more careful the next time.  I'm talking about
3d26cb65c2 "Move adjustment of CPUID_EXT_PDCM..".

Speaking of the other change - it fixed a real bug which I hit myself,
and I had no idea it's tricky - actually no one had this idea until
e9efa4a771 "property for arch_capabilities".  So yes, this is a "sh*t
happens" case :)


Ok.

So, back to the situation and the plan (two of them).


1. It looks like we agree we should pick

6529f31e0d target/i386: add compatibility property for pdcm feature
e9efa4a771 target/i386: add compatibility property for arch_capabilities

to 10.1.x, to make migration from older versions to 10.1.x work.


2.  For 10.0.x, we've two options:

  2.a.  Revert
     e9efa4a771 "do not expose ARCH_CAPABILITIES"
     3d26cb65c2 "Move adjustment of CPUID_EXT_PDCM"
   as you initially suggested and already reviewed.

   This will make 10.0.[45] "bad" wrt migration, and will re-create the
   issues these 2 commits fixed, but will make next 10.0.x as good as
   initial 10.0.0 wrt migration.

  2.b.  Instead of reverting these two which are already in 10.0.[45],
   pretend 10.0 always had these 2 commits, and adjust subsequent
   qemu versions just like we did with 2 "add compatibility property"
   changes, but make it to be 9.2-compat property, not 10.0-compat
   property.

   This - as far as I can see - will make 10.0.[0-3] to be "bad" wrt
   migration, but not subsequent 10.0.x ones.  And will keep the bugs
   fixed in 10.0.x too.

But again, I don't understand the migration logic well, so don't know
if it even makes sense.  2.b, if deemed to be good, will be the first
in history (I think) to introduce compat properties for past machine
types.

Please excuse me for so much text :)

Thank you!
