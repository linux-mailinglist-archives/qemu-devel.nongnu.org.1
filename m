Yes.  The capacity is not back with the device to reissue.
On an MH-MLD/SLD we'd need to prevent it being added (not shared) to multip=
le hosts,
this is kind of the temporal equivalent of that.

No - or at least the device should not be doing that.  The FM might try
again, but only once it knows try 1 failed. For reasons of this aligning
with MHD case where you definitely can't offer it to more than one host,
I think we should not do it.  Whether we should put any effort into blocking
it is a different question.  User error :)

Note, the host must not remove a log entry until it has dealt with it
(sent a response) so there is no obvious reason to bother with a retry.
Maybe a booting host would reject all offered extents (because it's not rea=
dy
for them yet), but then I'd want the FM to explicitly decide to tell the de=
vice
to offer gain.

Whilst this is a custom interface, the equivalent FM API does say.

"The command, with selection policy Enable Shared Access, shall also fail w=
ith Invalid
Input under the following conditions:
=E2=80=A2 When the specified region is not Sharable
=E2=80=A2 When the tagged capacity is already mapped to any Host ID via a n=
on-Sharable
region
=E2=80=A2 When the tagged capacity cannot be added to the requested region =
due to deviceimposed
restrictions
=E2=80=A2 When the same tagged capacity is currently accessible by the same=
 LD"

Little fuzzy because of the whole pending vs 'mapped / accessible' wording =
but
I think intent is you can't send again until first one is dealt with.
