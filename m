It's hard to tell, I don't know EHCI but there's a TODO comment near that 
error so maybe there's some EHCI feature not emulated that you may need to 
implement in QEMU there. I guess you'd need to check the EHCI 
specification or the docs of the actual chip that is emulated for info on 
how this should work.

Also to get more debugging info to see what's happening you can add 
--trace enable="usb*" (or see qemu/hw/usb/trace-events for the list of 
trace points available that could be enabled individually) in case you 
were not aware of that. There are several ways to enable trace points, see 
QEMU docs on that. Apart from the simple enable=pattern these can also be 
controlled from QEMU monitor or put the list in a text file and use that 
with --trace to enable several of these.
