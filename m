Right.  That was the plan when drafting this, the hope is spinning will
almost not happen, and even if it happens it'll finish soon (migration is
completing, it means network mustn't be so bad), unless the network is
stuck exactly at when we send the bye().

I agree.  The issue is if so, migration code needs to be always be prepared
with a possible async op even if in 99.9999% cases it won't happen... we
need to complicate the multifd logic a lot for this, but the gain is
little..

This series still used patch 1 to fix the problem (rather than do real BYE
on preempt channels, for example) only because it's the easiest, after all
it's still a contract in tls channel impl to allow premature termination
for explicit shutdown()s on the host.

If we want to do 100% graceful shutdowns, we'll need to apply this to all
channels, and the async-possible model can definitely add more complexity
more than multifd.  I hope it won't be necessary.. but just to mention it.

I recall one of your future series on TLS would start to enable async for
all channels?  In all cases, we definitely don't want to have this call to
be relevant to the blocking mode of the channels.

Would it make sense to introduce a _sync() version of it, but keep the
original bye(), leaving the rest until a real async user appears?

I can also at least drop this patch as of now, because we can still wish it
almost always be synchronous.  However we have risk forgetting that forever
and hit it a few years later..

Thanks,
