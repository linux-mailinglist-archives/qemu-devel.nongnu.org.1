Yes, sorry for the typo.

In terms of code, it doesn't change anything. we could reuse SysEmuTarget.
I just think it's more clear to have the enum defined next to the 
structure using it, compared to have this buried in generated code that 
can't be grepped easily.
(git grep SYS_EMU returns nothing, so people have to remember it's 
converted from a Json, and that naming is different).
IMHO, DRY principle should not always be followed blindly when it hurts 
code readability.

That said, my editor is able to find the generated definition as well, 
so I don't really mind reusing SysEmuTarget if we think the code 
readability is not worth the duplication.

However, I think it's a problem to compare strings to find this, when it 
can be set at compile time, in a file that will have to stay target 
specific anyway.
