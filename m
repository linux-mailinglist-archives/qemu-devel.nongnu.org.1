Looks like I missed some things when I looked at it, probably minor or
a matter of preference in the great scheme of things. It might still
be worth mentioning them here.

In patch 19 we are testing exposed clocks and AFAICS there are no
qtest APIs for that. We can probably add a qest API for that though.

In patch 9 we are using internal APIs exposed by the generic flexcom
device to check that device selection works as expected. I don't see
how we can reimplement that with qtest, this is a classic example of
what unit tests can enable vs functional testing.

There are also a few things that are a bit cumbersome to do with
qtest. In patch 13 and 16 we introduce i2c and spi echo test devices
to test i2c/spi transactions. I've noticed that device qtests use an
existing i2c peripheral for tests. We could add the i2c and spi test
devices to qemu and have them enabled by default. Or continue using
existing spi/i2c peripherals for testing spi/i2c controllers for
qtests which I personally don't like because it requires knowledge of
specific peripherals.

That being said, I'll go ahead and switch to qtests, if only to better
understand advantages / disadvantages and separate this patch from the
bigger device unit tests discussion.

I still think that writing device tests as unit tests is better:
 - devices can be tested independently
 - we can test more, including internal behaviour and APIs, error paths, et=
c.
 - enable sanitizers by default for device tests*

I wonder what people think and what would be a path to enable device
unit tests. What would we need to prove, besides converting existing
device qtests to unit tests, which I can certainly help with.

*I was surprised to see that sanitizers are not enabled by default on
unit tests when host dependencies are available, what is preventing
that?
