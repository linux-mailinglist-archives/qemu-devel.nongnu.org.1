Yes.

It's also much faster than writing to isa-debugcon

Thanks for the pointer.

Yes, it's a ring buffer.  Size is configurable, default
is 32 pages aka 128k.

Correct.

There is a lock to make sure parallel access (inside edk2, when setting
up SMP) doesn't corrupt the log.  It is probably possible for qemu to
just grab that lock while it reads the buffer.

I'd expect the typical use case would be more like figuring why the
machine doesn't boot in case the firmware ran into some problem early
enough that reporting it to the console is not yet possible but
seriously enough that it can't continue booting.  The firmware
typically sits in a 'hlt' loop then and doesn't write more data to
the log.

Requires coding some knowledge about OVMF internals into qemu.

take care,
