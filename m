I would flip it around and ask why would documentation not be held
to the same standard as code, when it comes to licensing and legal
compliance ?

This is all copyright content that we merge & distribute under the
same QEMU licensing terms, and we have the same legal obligations
whether it is "source code" or "documentation" or other content
that is not traditional "source code" (images for example).

I can understand that desire, and it is an admittedly tricky situation
and tradeoff for which I don't have a great answer.

As a starting point we (as reviewers/maintainers) must be broadly
very tolerant & accepting of content that is not perfect English,
because we know many (probably even the majority of) contributors
won't have English as their first language.

As a reviewer I don't mind imperfect language in submissions. Even
if language is not perfect it is at least a direct expression of
the author's understanding and thus we can have a level of trust
in the docs based on our community experience with the contributor.

If docs have been altered in any significant manner by an LLM,
even if they are linguistically improved, IMHO, knowing that use
of LLM would reduce my personal trust in the technically accuracy
of the contribution.

This is straying into the debate around the accuracy of LLMs though,
which is interesting, but tangential from the purpose of this policy
which aims to focus on the code provenance / legal side. 



So, back on track, a important point is that this policy (& the
legal concerns/risks it attempts to address) are implicitly
around contributions that can be considered copyrightable.

Some so called "trivial" work can be so simplistic as to not meet
the threshold for copyright protection, and it is thus easy for the
DCO requirements to be satisfied.


As a person, when you write the API documentation from scratch,
your output would generally be considered to be copyrightable
contribution by the author.

When a reviewer then suggests changes to your docs, most of the
time those changes are so trivial, that the reviewer wouldn't be
claiming copyright over the resulting work.

If the reviewer completely rewrites entire sentences in the
docs though, though would be able to claim copyright over part
of the resulting work.


The tippping point between copyrightable/non-copyrightable is
hard to define in a policy. It is inherantly fuzzy, and somewhat
of a "you'll know it when you see it" or "lets debate it in court"
situation...


So back to LLMs.


If you ask the LLM (or an agent using an LLM) to entirely write
the API docs from scratch, I think that should be expected to
fall under this proposed contribution policy in general.


If you write the API docs yourself and ask the LLM to review and
suggest improvements, that MAY or MAY NOT fall under this policy.

If the LLM suggested tweaks were minor enough to be considered
not to meet the threshold to be copyrightable it would be fine,
this is little different to a human reviewer suggesting tweaks.


If the LLM suggested large scale rewriting that would be harder
to draw the line, but would tend towards falling under this
contribution policy.

So it depends on the scope of what the LLM suggested as a change
to your docs.

IOW, LLM-as-sparkling-auto-correct is probably OK, but
LLM-as-book-editor / LLM-as-ghost-writer is probably NOT OK

This is a scenario where the QEMU contributor has to use their
personal judgement as to whether their use of LLM in a docs context
is compliant with this policy, or not. I don't think we should try
to describe this in the policy given how fuzzy the situation is.

NB, this copyrightable/non-copyrightable situation applies to source
code too, not just docs.

With regards,
Daniel
