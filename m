Yes, that could be very noticable for the guest.

bdrv_open() being synchronous is a problem in general. It is somewhat
mitigated in some block drivers like qcow2 by creating a coroutine that
does the real open and an AIO_WAIT_WHILE_UNLOCKED() call that waits for
the coroutine, but processes other events, too (though it doesn't
process events in iohandler_ctx, like new QMP commands). But at least in
the common case, bdrv_open() is relatively fast anyway.

I guess the easiest way to deal with it in the luks block driver would
be offloading the calculations to a task in the thread pool and using
AIO_WAIT_WHILE_UNLOCKED() to wait for its completion. We could combine
it with the qcow2 approach to cover the read request(s?) for the image
file, too.

Yes.

The problem is that block_crypto_read_func() calls bdrv_pread().

When called outside of a coroutine, it creates a coroutine, takes the
graph reader lock and calls bdrv_co_pread().

When called from a coroutine, it's just a thin wrapper that calls
bdrv_co_pread() directly without creating a new coroutine and without
taking the graph lock, but calling bdrv_co_pread() still requires that
you hold the lock. So we need to make sure that either the graph lock is
already taken when the function is called from coroutine context, or we
must take it here.
