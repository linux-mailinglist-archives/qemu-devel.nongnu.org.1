Every time I've replied to any message in this thread, I've gotten a
response:

| +Your message to pl@kamp.de couldn't be delivered.

Red Hat IT says that it is unlikely to be Red Hat's SPF settings, and
suspects that it is instead something caused by whatever Peter is
using to bounce mail from his alias Peter Lieven <pl@kamp.de> to his
Office 365 account.  As I appear to be unable to contact Peter (even
my use of direct email, bypassing the list, and using a personal
account instead of my Red Hat email) about this issue, I'm wondering
if Peter is still an active contributor to the project.

But while typing this email, to see if RBD, iSCSI, and NFS need a new
entry in MAINTAINERS, I did a search through the list archives, where
the last email I found from Peter was
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2023-01/msg00574.html,
which asked to update MAINTAINERS to his new address, and that has not
made it in so far...
