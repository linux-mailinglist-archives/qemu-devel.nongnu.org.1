Since I wasn't able to attend the BOF, I delayed my reply until after
I could get some experience with Manos's code and make a list of
things to do in the immediate future. I think my recent patches reach
the point at which the work can be parallelized (and a list of
subsequent steps are at https://wiki.qemu.org/RustInQemu#TODO).

Here is my version:

9.2
--enable-rust is available and developers can build with it. Ideally
this results in feature parity, but we cannot yet be sure that this is
the case. (Current holes are documented in
https://wiki.qemu.org/RustInQemu#TODO)

10.x
--enable-rust is default.
Duplicates of existing code are allowed in order to gain experience
with the creation of bindings to C code, but should (probably must)
have feature parity with C code.
It is possible to build Rust devices that have a limited amount of
unsafe code in the device itself, especially during runtime as opposed
to initialization.

11.x
--enable-rust is mandatory and disabling it will drop support for
devices or boards.

Agreed. The blog post should also document some of the design decisions.

Yeah, based on the detection code that we added in "configure", it
seems that LLVM (and Rust) supports all of the targets in our support
matrix?

I am not sure of the benefits there. qboot has a bunch of hand-crafted
C macros to work in 16-bit mode, and does not even have a free()
function (it does have malloc() though). Rewriting qboot code in Rust
is unlikely teach us many lessons that are useful for the rest of
QEMU, and would not have substantial benefits in terms of memory
safety.

My main suggestion is to take it slowly. While the recent flurry of
posted patches may suggest otherwise, a lot of those were developed
over several months (sometimes years!) and the posted version is not
the first.

The other suggestion is for reviewers to not be afraid to say "I have
no idea what you're doing". If a reviewer does not understand how the
language is being used, the affected code must either have a clear
documentation explaining the design, or be rewritten.

Of course core bindings code will be more complex/complicated than we
all wish, but the important thing is to _absolutely_ get public APIs
right. Private implementation details can be subject to future
evolution and cleanup, while public APIs are much harder to change.
That said:

- bad public APIs tend to be larger red flags of technical debt in
Rust than in C

- we can look at what other projects (especially Linux) are doing, and
use that to make informed decisions. There aren't many projects doing
integration of Rust into massive C code bases, but we are not first.

- many of our core APIs (chardev, memory region ops, timers, etc.) are
fairly stable

- there are several patterns that are common across QEMU code (for
example Error**, or vtables), and therefore experience writing one set
of C<->Rust bindings will help with other areas of the code as well.

Things may be different in other areas. For example, block devices may
also suffer impedance mismatch between Rust async/await and C
coroutines.

I think that's relatively rare and we can cross that bridge when we
get there. The glib_rs crate exists, but I don't really like its
design, because it's very much tuned towards cloning C data to
Rust-managed memory and it hides the performance characteristics of
code that uses it. But if all we need is GArray/GPtrArray/GByteArray,
there's not a lot of code to write and there's no need for thunking.

That said, C<->Rust interoperability is something that has to be
tackled sooner or later for objects such as Error. I have my favored
approach (https://lore.kernel.org/r/all/20240701145853.1394967-4-pbonzini@r=
edhat.com/)
but it's not an easy subject. Again, let's take it slowly. It's okay
if the first devices cannot have a realize() function that fails, just
because we haven't figured out Error yet.

The posted patches have examples of both unit- and integration-testing
of Rust code.

Good idea, who does it? :)

Note that this is _not_ what we are doing right now. All dependent
crates are vendored and included in the QEMU tarball. However, this is
also why we are very conservative about adding new crates. Right now
it's basically only "bilge" and its dependency "arbitrary-int", a
crate for "readable bitfields".

Thanks for writing this down!
