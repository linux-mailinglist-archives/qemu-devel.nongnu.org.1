I don't really like the interleaving of file and socket logic at
multifd_recv_sync_main(), but I can live with it.

Waiting on multifd_recv_state->sem_sync is problematic because if the
thread has an error, that will hang forever.

Actually, I don't even see this being handled in _current_ code
anywhere, we probably have a bug there. I guess we need to add one more
"post this sem just because" somewhere. multifd_recv_kick_main probably.

Yeah, that could work. I think I'll blacklist all unused flags using the
invalid_flags logic.
