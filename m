Yes, there's no point. if we already have main and multifd channels,
what's left must be postcopy.

Well, but don't add it blindly if it doesn't make sense. The point was
to not end the conditional at 'else if' because that makes the reader
have to go look around the code to see what was already assigned. Here
we want just a plain:

else {
    channel = CH_POSTCOPY; 
}

Given the:

if (!mis->from_src_file) {

I think someone (back in 2017) thought it was possible to reach there
with from_src_file already set. I don't know whether that applied to
this path. In any case, for this function I believe the correct is
assert because we shouldn't have two channels arriving as main.

Maybe not, but we definitely cannot just ignore if it happens and we
also should not have an empty check that is always known to be true. So
either assert or remove the if entirely.

You're right, I missed the return statement.
