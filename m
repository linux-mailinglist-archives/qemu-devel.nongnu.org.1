I think it is better to distinguish saying "having a better performance 
is more important than being able to migrate this VM everywhere" from 
explicitly selecting all available offload features; the latter is lot 
of chores. More importantly, users may not just know these features may 
prevent migration; they may just look like performance features nice to 
have at first glance.

I don' think what a user would want are not individual performance 
knobs, but a user is more likely to need to express the platforms they 
would want to migrate VMs on. There are several possible scenarios in 
particular:
1) Migration everywhere
2) Migration on specific machines
3) Migration on some known platforms
4) No migration (migration on nowhere)

If a user chooses 1-3), QEMU may reject platform-dependent features even 
if the user requests one; in this way, we don't need the users to make 
things crystal clear, but we can expect QEMU does so.

If a user chooses 2-4), QEMU may enable all offloading features 
available on the specified platforms. Again, the user will no longer 
have to know each individual performance features. QEMU may also reject 
migration to platforms not specified to prevent misconfiguration.

The -platform proposal earlier corresponds to 3). However it has a 
downside that QEMU needs to know about platforms, which may not be 
trivial. In that case, we can support 1), 2), and 4).
