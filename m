Hi Thomas,

I would generally defer the decision about integrating the netboot code 
to someone with more insight than me, but for what it's worth, I am of 
the opinion that if we want to rework all of panics into returns, then 
it would make the most sense to also do the integration now so that we 
can avoid using jump altogether.  Unless I'm missing something simple, I 
don't think the panic/return conversion will be trivial, and actually I 
think it will be quite invasive since there are dozens of calls to panic 
and assert that will need to be changed.   It doesn't seem worthwhile to 
do all of these conversions in order to avoid using jump, but then still 
being exposed to possible problems caused by jumping due to netboot 
requiring it anyway.

Regards,

Jared Rossi
