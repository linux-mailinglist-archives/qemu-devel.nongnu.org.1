For deciding on the variant, I only looked at whether the caller holds
the graph lock or not.

Right, my patches are not enough to address that kind of problem.

Yes, I can mention something in the commit message, maybe:

Functions like qmp_blockdev_mirror() query the nodes to act on before
draining and locking. In theory, draining could invalidate those nodes.
This kind of issue is not addressed by these commits.
