That's not really a usage model QEMU currently supports. We generally
speaking model what the actual hardware does. In the same way,
if you were running CI on the real EVK board your CI would have
to deal with those devices being present.

Yeah; I haven't actually checked carefully whether there
are NXP specifics here, as that device-tree compat string
suggests. But it's almost certainly the same general principle:
there's a memory-mapped system counter which is the global
source of the system count, and each CPU consumes that count
and uses it to feed its generic timers and counters. So if
you mess with the enable on the memory mapped system counter
then this causes the CPU's timers/counters to stop ticking.

I modelled this similarly to the in-tree M-profile
sse-counter and sse-timer, where you link the timer to
the counter and there's an API that lets the timer know
when the counter is enabled/disabled, changes frequency, etc.
This needs changes to the timer and counter code in the CPU
itself. (You can get away without doing this if you assume
that the guest code never tries to actually disable the system
counter or pick a non-default frequency, which is typically true:
it will just want to set it up to a single standard config and
then leave it alone.)

this counter, IIUC. I suppose that QEMU doesn't support these idle states, =
it only seems to support WFI. But if it did, then this counter would wake u=
p the CPUs (if I'm not mistaken, I'm no expert here). It would be nice to b=
e able to boot the machine via U-Boot, and I wonder if that could fix the i=
dle states when there are PSCI handlers in the secure world. Again, this pr=
obably also requires the counter implementation. Looking into U-Boot, TF-A,=
 and OP-TEE is on my plan, but right now I'm focusing on direct kernel boot=
.

Hmm, if the system counter can generate interrupts then
it might be different from the Arm IP block in that
respect. I'd have to check the datasheet. Anyway, as
you suggest this is all something we can postpone until
we need to care about running EL3 firmware in the guest.
