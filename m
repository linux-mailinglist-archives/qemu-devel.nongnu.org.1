That was my first approach, I will rework it on the second version. The 
generated code should not exist in committed code at all.

It was initally tricky setting up the dependency orders correctly, so I 
first committed it and then made it a dependency.

That'd mean you cannot work on the rust files with a LanguageServer, you 
cannot run cargo build or cargo check or cargo clippy, etc. That's why I 
left the alternative choice of including a manually generated bindings 
file (generated.rs.inc)

Yes, vendor-the-world is a different topic than vendor e.g. two crates 
such as the dependencies I'm using here.

We'll see that as we progress. Might enable more platform support, for 
example. I have no definite answers here. Also, I know binary bloat is a 
big complaint from people with dislike of Rust, so I pre-emptively 
addressed it.
