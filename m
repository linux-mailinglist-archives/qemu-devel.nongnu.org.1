Yeah, this is mostly me being lazy - by the time I realized that
an enum would have been better, I didn't want to rewrite it, so I
just sent this RFC as is.

I'm fine with that, as long as we don't need to be able to
programmatically query that distinction. From an external
view, '= false' and <unset> would be undistinguishable
and both be considered 'insecure'.

It would mean we, as maintainers, would know what files
are yet to be evaluated for their security status which
is still useful.

Sigh, yes. No new burden.
