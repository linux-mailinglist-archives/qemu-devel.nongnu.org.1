I tried using bitfield-struct. The definitions are a bit less polished than
bilge but usage is the same, it is const friendly and has fewer
dependencies. I don't think there's one that's clearly better, but we can
look at the tradeoffs and decide.

To streamline expressions on bit flags maybe we could have a macro like
bits!(Interrupt: RX | TX) which expands to
Interrupt.RX.union(Interrupt.TX), where union() is a const function
(likewise for & or !). This should not be hard to write as a procedural
macro, it's just a recursive descent parser.

Understood. The nice thing to have would be to automatically derive the
PropertyInfo from the type of the field.
