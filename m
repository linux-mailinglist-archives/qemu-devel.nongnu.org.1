Since I missed this question in previous versions and seems no one have 
answered yet; so I add my answer here:

If the hack is intended to be temporary, it should be implemented with a 
compatibility property.

docs/devel/migration/compatibility.rst says "migration is only supposed 
to work if you use the same machine type in both source and 
destination." So it is fine to make a sensible change to the 
guest-visible behavior for newer machine type versions.

What's not tolerated is to break the existing versions. Please note that 
such a rule is applied for *each patch* instead of the entire series. It 
looks the patch series once creates a change of the ACPI table and patch 
"hw: arm: virt-acpi-build: add temporary hack to match existing 
behavior" reverts it. This prevents git bisect so should be avoided 
according to: docs/devel/submitting-a-patch.rst

I think making a change is fine as long as the rules described in the 
documentation are followed and it "makes sense" in general; I cannot 
really tell if it makes sense since I have rarely touched that 
particular code, but you can actually send a patch to make the change, 
possibily with the RFC tag, and ask for review.

Regards,
Akihiko Odaki
