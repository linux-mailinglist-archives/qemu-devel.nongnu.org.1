I think we shouldn't overly obsess[1] about 'xz', because the overwhealmingly
common scenario is that volunteer maintainers are honest people. QEMU is
in a massively better peer review situation. With xz there was basically no
oversight of the new maintainer. With QEMU, we have oversight from 1000's
of people on the list, a huge pool of general maintainers, the specific
migration maintainers, and the release manager merging code.

With a lack of historical experiance with QEMU maintainership, I'd suggest
that new RDMA volunteers would start by adding themselves to the "MAINTAINERS"
file with only the 'Reviewer' classification. The main migration maintainers
would still handle pull requests, but wait for a R-b from one of the RMDA
volunteers. After some period of time the RDMA folks could graduate to full
maintainer status if the migration maintainers needed to reduce their load.
I suspect that might prove unneccesary though, given RDMA isn't an area of
code with a high turnover of patches.

With regards,
Daniel

[1] If we do want to obsess about something bad though, we should
    look at our handling of binary blobs in the repo and tarballs.
    ie the firmware binaries that all get built in an arbitrary
    environment of their respective maintainer. If we need firmware
    blobs in tree, we should strive to come up with a reprodicble
    build environment that gives us byte-for-byte identical results,
    so the blobs can be verified. This is rather a tangent from this
    thread though :)
