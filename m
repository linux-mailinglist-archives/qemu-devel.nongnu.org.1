Creation on demand is fine when we want to create the thing only when
there is demand.

I guess it can also be okay when we want to create it always, but don't
want to decide when exactly (must be before first use), although I
suspect that's just lazy more often than not.

Yes.  Anything else invites abuse.

Yes, this abuses container_get() to get an "e500-ccsr", which is a
device, not a container.

By the way, intentation is confusing here.

I think it's worthwhile.

Makes sense.  Thanks!
