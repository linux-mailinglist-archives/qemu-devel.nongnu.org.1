Sounds good.

For the virtio-based ones, I don’t know whether the interface should 
allow to map virtqueues to threads, though (as virtio-blk allows now).  
It doesn’t make sense for FUSE because of the round-robin nature, but 
for other exports, I don’t know.

But I’m happy to not worry about that for now. :)
