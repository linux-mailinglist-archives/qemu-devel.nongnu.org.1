FWIW, I considered that the "exception process" would end up
being something like...

 * someone wants to use a particular tool for something they
   believe is compelling
 * they complain on qemu-devel that our policy blocks their
   valid use
 * we debate it
 * if agreed, we add a note to this code-proveance.rst doc to
   allow it


I would imagine that exceptions might fall into two buckets

 * Descriptions of techniques/scenarios for using tools
   that limit the licensing risk
 * Details of specific tools (or more likely models) that
   are judged to have limited licensing risk

it is hard to predict the future though, so this might be
too simplistic. Time will tell when someone starts the
debate...


IOW, my suggestion would be that the document simply tells
people to raise a thread on qemu-devel if they would like
to discuss need for a particular exception, and mention
that any exceptions will be documented in this doc if they
are aggreed upon.

IMHO the code-provenance.rst doc is what grants the exception, not
any individual person, nor any individual commit.

Whether we want to reference that a given commit is relying on an
exception or not is hard to say at this point as we don't know what
any exception would be like.

Ideally the applicability of an exception could be self-evident
from the commit. Realiyt might be more fuzzy. So if self-evident,
then it likely warrants a sentence two of english text in the
commit to justify its applicability.

IOW, a tag like AI-exception-granted-by doesn't feel like it is
particularly useful.

I'm not sure what you mean by 'case-by-case basis' ? I certainly don't
think we should entertain debating use of AI in individual patch series,
as that'll be a never ending burden on reviewer/maintainer resources.

Exceptions should be things that can be applied somewhat generically to
tools, or models or usage scenarios IMHO.

I would suggest only this last paragraph be changed


  This policy may evolve as AI tools mature and the legal situation is
  clarifed.

  Exceptions
  ----------

  The QEMU project welcomes discussion on any exceptions to this policy,
  or more general revisions. This can be done by contacting the qemu-devel
  mailing list with details of a proposed tool / model / usage scenario /
  etc that is beneficial to QEMU, while still mitigating the legal risks
  to the project.

  After discussion, any exceptions that can be relied upon in contributions
  will be listed below. The listing of an exception does not remove the
  need for contributors to comply with all other pre-existing contribution
  requirements, including DCO signoff.


With regards,
Daniel
