5 seems like a reasonable number. Unless people have the
path_grouping_policy set to failover, 5 path groups seems like more
than enough. You could make the argument that if users were configured
with failover (one path per path group) or had a number paths marked
marginal (and placed into marginal path groups), you could exceed 5
path groups. 8 would seems like a reasonable maximum then. It is
possible to have multipath devices with over 8 paths, but that's pretty
rare.
