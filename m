So there's two issues at play.

FreeBSD does maintain all our archival releases forever. They never change.
But, we don't have permanent links to them today. We start with one URL and
then migrate to a second one when they transition from supported to unsuppo=
rted.
We do this, in part, to make sure people upgrade. So in effect, this breaka=
ge
means that our notion is "working" in the sense that the FreeBSD project's =
goals
of making people "keep up to date."

This does, I realize, clash with the views that QEMU wants to have some sta=
ble
way to test images over time, even if the upstream's notion of supported or=
 not
changes.

One easy idea might be to 'prestage' the 'legacy' releases when they
are supported
on the 'legacy' server so that tests can be written with the legacy
path so that these
tests always work, now and in the future.

So, this is terrible from a FreeBSD point of view. We'd like it if
qemu always tested
all of our releases, as well as snapshots of the tip of the spear.
There's got to be some
way to have some shared responsibility that we can automate. FreeBSD could =
test
the most recent release of qemu against a bunch of images in our CI
cluster. But we
don't actually have a CI cluster we could put that into (our focus is
just a little different)
today. Ideally, your (3) above would happen as we rotate in new
versions and out old
versions of FreeBSD. But honestly, I'm the person (or one of the
people) that should
be keeping his eye on the ball, but we see how well that has worked
out. So the question
becomes is this a management failure (eg, someone/something needs to prompt=
 me
or others in the FreeBSD project to update it via reminders, release
checklists, etc)?
Or is it something that can fixed by automations somehow? I don't know...
