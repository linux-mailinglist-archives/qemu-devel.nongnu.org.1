looking back and at Daniels reply,
max/host are indeed are 'special' aka mutable as opposed to named cpu model=
s.

if we go by the books, 'host' and by extension 'max' should work with KVM a=
ccelerator.
But that (aka reducing it to isapc levels) should be done at 'host' cpu mod=
el code
and that part of code is not really aware (nor should be) of machine types.
I'm not sure, whether it's worth the effort and complexity.

I'd be fine with valid_cpu_types[] approach here, i.e. user will get
clear error that her is doing wrong thing trying 'host/max',
and printing suggestion how to remedy error should guide user
to the right config.
