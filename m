In physical systems yes - in QEMU not yet, though it's a quirk
of the available ids to get to the ACPI devices (which oddly
are PCI devices :()

Ah, looking up my description is unclear. I meant two optional parameters
pci-dev or acpi-dev - which one was supplied would indicate the type
of handle to be used.

Yes.  Slightly shortcut is that the UID is the bus number for all the
relevant devices so I can abuse that.  QEMU doesn't keep track of
the ACPI handles directly so this is the current cleanest solution.
