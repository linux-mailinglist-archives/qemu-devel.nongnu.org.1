A maintainer's life is easy when patches have a clear motivation. With
this patch series I'm not convinced there is a clear motivation, and
that makes me hesitate about applying them.

If it's okay with you, Tanish and Paolo, please hold on to the patches
and let's see how they fit into the larger goal of Rust tracing
support. If they help with that then I would be happy to merge them
together with Rust tracing patches.
