In terms of launching QEMU I'd imagine:

  $QEMU -machine pc-q35-9.1 -platform linux-6.9 ...args...

Any virtual machine HW features which are tied to host kernel features
would have their defaults set based on the requested -platform. The
-machine will be fully invariant wrt the host kernel.

You would have -platform hlep to list available platforms, and
corresonding QMP "query-platforms" command to list what platforms
are supported on a given host OS.

Downstream distros can provide their own platforms definitions
(eg "linux-rhel-9.5") if they have kernels whose feature set
diverges from upstream due to backports.

Mgmt apps won't need to be taught about every single little QEMU
setting whose default is derived from the kernel. Individual
defaults are opaque and controlled by the requested platform.

Live migration has clearly defined semantics, and mgmt app can
use query-platforms to validate two hosts are compatible.

Omitting -platform should pick the very latest platform that is
cmpatible with the current host (not neccessarily the latest
platform built-in to QEMU).


With regards,
Daniel
