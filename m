Not sure if I got this one. The HEST table is part of etc/acpi/tables,
which is already tested, as you pointed at the previous reviews. Doing
changes there is already detected. That's basically why we added patches
10 and 12:

	[PATCH v3 10/14] tests/acpi: virt: allow acpi table changes for a new table: HEST
	[PATCH v3 12/14] tests/acpi: virt: add a HEST table to aarch64 virt and update DSDT

What tests don't have is a check for etc/hardware_errors firmware inside 
tests/data/acpi/aarch64/virt/, but, IMO, we shouldn't add it there.

See, hardware_errors table contains only some skeleton space to
store:

	- 1 or more error block address offsets;
	- 1 or more read ack register;
	- 1 or more HEST source entries containing CPER blocks.

There's nothing there to be actually checked: it is just some
empty spaces with a variable number of fields.

With the new code, the actual number of CPER blocks and their
corresponding offsets and read ack registers can be different on 
different architectures. So, for instance, when we add x86 support,
we'll likely start with just one error source entry, while arm will
have two after this changeset.

Also, one possibility to address the issues reported by Gavin Shan at
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20250214041635.608012-1-gshan@redhat.com/
would be to have one entry per each CPU. So, the size of such firmware
could be dependent on the number of CPUs.

So, adding any validation to it would just cause pain and probably
won't detect any problems.

What could be done instead is to have a different type of tests that
would use the error injection script to check if regressions are 
introduced after QEMU 10.0. Such new kind of test would require
this series to be merged first. It would also require the usage of
an OSPM image with some testing tools on it. This is easier said 
than done, as besides the complexity of having an OSPM test image,
such kind of tests would require extra logic, specially if it would
check regressions for SEA and other notification sources.

Thanks,
Mauro
