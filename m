We want to be testing against latest packages because that reflects
what our users are likely to see on their own systems. IOW, having
failures after newly updated packages is a good thing - provided we
can easily identify what caused the breakage, to enable us to fix
it promptly - by promptly I mean same-day.

Only seeing breakage from new packages as long as a few months after it
happens is a bad thing. We benefit from fast detection and fast fixing.
In cases where the new package is broken, rather than QEMU, it is also
better to be able to report that back to the distro within days of them
rolling out the problem as it'll be fresh in their minds to fix.

With regards,
Daniel
