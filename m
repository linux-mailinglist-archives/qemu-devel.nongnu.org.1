Bringing this thread back from the dead, since I had an in-person
discussion on a key question below at KVM Forum this year and want
to record it here.

To recap the situation

 * The license of the code generator itself does not determine the
   license of the output generated code

 * The license of the inputs to the code generator, may or may
   not, determine the license of the output generated code depending
   on use context

The primary input to the code generator is the QAPI schema, which is part
of QEMU and thus licensed GPL-2.0-or-later.

The QAPI schema includes both the API definitions AND the API documentation
text.

We can make the case that as the QEMU public interface, consuming the
API definitions in the QAPI schema for the purpose of generating code
is "fair use", and thus the output generated code does NOT need to
match the GPL-2.0-or-later license of the QAPI schema. We can choose
the code license, and a maximally permissive license looks appropriate.

We want to have API documentation for the Golang bindings and the obvious
way to achieve this is to copy the API docs from the QAPI schema into the
Golang code. It is NOT reasonable to class such *direct copying* of docs
"fair use".  IOW, copied docs will be under GPL-2.0-or-later.

Thus if we pick MIT-0 for the Golang code, and copy across the QAPI docs,
the resulting  Golang QAPI project code would be under a compound license
term "MIT-0 AND GPL-2.0-or-later".

The concern was that this will limit the ability of downstream
applications to consume the Golang bindings, if they don't want their
combined work to contain GPL-2.0-or-later.

Ignoring whether this fear of GPL-2.0-or-later is sane or not,
in retrospect I believe that this concern in fact has no legal
basis.

The license of a compiled application binary is the union of all
the object files linked into it.

Notice I said "Object file" there, **NOT** "Source file".

This is the crucial distinction that makes the presense of
GPL-2.0-or-later docs a non-issue from a licensing POV.


When the compiler takes the "MIT-0 and GPL-2.0-or-later" license
.go source file, and builds an object file, it will be discarding
all the API documentation comments. IOW, all the parts that were
under GPL-2.0-or-later are discarded. The only parts of the source
file that get "compiled" are the Go language constructs which were
MIT-0 licensed [1].

IOW, we have a "MIT-0 and GPL-2.0-or-later" .go source file,
and an "MIT-0" object file.

Thus while there may be a human perception problem with the Golang
bindings being "MIT-0 and GPL-2.0-or-later", there are no legal
licensing limitations, as the combined work for a library or
application linking the bindings will only contain the MIT-0 part.

The GPL-2.0-or-later docs won't influence the license of the
combined work.

Note, this interpretation applies only to languages which are
compiled, not interpreted.

If we are generating python code for example, the there is
no "source file" vs "object file" distinction for licensing.
The combined work in a python app is under the union of all
the source file licenses.


TL;DR: I think you can re-add the documentation comments to
the Golang code generator, declare the resulting code as being
"MIT-0 AND GPL-2.0-or-later".

In the README.md file we need todo two important things:

 * Document our interpretation of the "combined work" license
   situation for applications consuming the project.
 * Declare that *ALL* manually written code contributions
   are exclusively MIT-0.

With regards,
Daniel

[1] NB, there are languages where some code comments can have semantic
    impacts on the compiled out. I don't believe that to be the case for
    any human targetted API docs that we would be copying over from the
    QAPI schema though in the Golang case.
