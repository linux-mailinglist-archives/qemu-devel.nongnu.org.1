Hi Bernd,
I wanted to check with you to see if you have thought more about
ASYNC_CANCEL support for FUSE-over-io_uring SQEs?

If you don't have time to implement it, maybe you could share your
thoughts on how one would go about doing this? That would be a nice
starting point if someone else wants to try it out.

Thanks,
Stefan
