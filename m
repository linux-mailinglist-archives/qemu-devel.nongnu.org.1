Thanks for the explanation. I missed the part where the ram_slots were being
used just to solve potential alignment issues and pc-dimms could occupy the same
space being allocated via machine_memory_devices_init().

This patch isn't far off then. If we take care to avoid plugging unaligned memory
we might not even need this spare area.

I was trying to refer to a situation we faced 3+ years ago in the powerpc machines,
where we were trying to add virtio-mem support there given that virtio-mem is/was
been seen (as far as I can remember anyways) as a more robust solution than
virtio-balloon + DIMM hotplug for guest memory management from the host point of
view.

I'm probably misrepresenting the whole situation though, it has been awhile :)


Thanks,
