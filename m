Hi Markus,

Logical Device.  I'll spell it out the first time. From the glossary:
"LD: Logical Device. Entity that represents a CXL Endpoint that is bound to
a VCS.  An SLD contains one LD. An MLD contains multiple LDs."

So what does that actually mean?  It's a number that identifies the
bit of a device that is presented to a given host at a particular
point in the PCI topology that we are faking from the underlying CXL
one.=20

I think best I can do is just spell out the acronyms. If people
want more they need to look at the spec :(

Time for a deeper explanation that probably no one ever wanted :)

=46rom a physical topology point of view think of something like:

vPPDs are virtual downstream ports that assign an LD ID.

These IDs should only be reported for events that are isolated=20
(as appropriate) to a head and/or LD and as you can see the hosts
don't actually know these IDs even exist hence there is no need to
report them via in band path.  If they don't take the values
that reflect the LD we are actually talking to, then we are
reporting someone else's error! Via out of band / switch CCI we
see the top diagram where we definitely need LD_ID and HEAD_ID
to make any sense of errors, particularly as the memory addresses
in the records are specific to Head/LD pair.
=20
The recommendation of the spec is don't set them for simple reporting
over inband mailboxes. Now you might think we don't have out of band
support upstream yet (my staging CXL tree does have both MCTP over
I2C and USB) but we do have the switch CCI and that can tunnel to
out of band interfaces (technically it's over PCI Vendor defined
messages but in practice it ends up the same from a 'what can I talk
to' point of view as something truely out of band like an I2C bus.
We don't actually have event queues on those yet though... When
we do we'll want this command to queue events there as well as on
for inband path.

So we are adding them now for 2 reasons.
1) The spec allows it even for boring inband event reporting
   (recommendation only to not do so) so we need to check the kernel stack
   reports correctly.
2) We will want to add event queues on the out of band interfaces and
   for those we'll need these IDs.

Yes. Though feels odd to reference the glossary for the definitions.
