Hi Alex,
 From my understanding the ram_device_mem_ops sets up the BAR access for 
a guest passthrough device. Unfortunately today an s390x KVM guest 
doesn't use and have support for these MIO instructions. We wanted to 
use this series as an initial test vehicle of the mmap support.

Thanks

Farhan
