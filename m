Don't forget that the machine can be running 5 migrations
of different VMs concurrently, and so may not be as quick
to finish sending traffic as we expect. Since QEMU's mig
protocol is essentially undirectional, I wonder if the
send buffer could still be full of VMstate data waiting
to be sent ? Perhaps its fine, but I don't like relying
on luck, or hard-to-prove scenarios.

Even if the migration code is relying on non-blocking sockets
for most of its work, at the time we're ready to invoke "bye",
perhaps the migration code could simply call

 qio_channel_set_blocking(ioc, true)

to switch the socket over to blocking mode.

If we leave the current code as-is, and relying on migration switching
to blocking mode first before calling bye, we'll be ok
