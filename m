I found a few:

* TYPE_X86_CPU properties "feature-words" and "filtered-features" have
  struct type X86CPUFeatureWordInfo.  Defined in target/i386/cpu.c
  x86_cpu_initfn().

* TYPE_X86_CPU property "crash-information" has union type
  GuestPanicInformation.  Defined in target/i386/cpu.c
  x86_cpu_common_class_init().

* TYPE_VIRTIO_BLK property "iothread-vq-mapping" has type
  IOThreadVirtQueueMappingList, which is a list of struct
  IOThreadVirtQueueMapping.  Property defined in hw/block/virtio-blk.c
  virtio_blk_properties[] using macro
  DEFINE_PROP_IOTHREAD_VQ_MAPPING_LIST defined in
  qdev-properties-system.[ch].

In case you're curious how I fond them...  First, I collected device
help:

    $ for i in `upstream-qemu -nodefaults -S -display none -device help | s=
ed -n 's/^name "\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p'`; do upstream-qemu -nodefaults -S -displ=
ay none -device $i,help; done >dev-help

Then I extracted the type names:

    $ sed -n 's/.*=3D<\([^>]*\)>.*/\1/p' <dev-help | sort -u

Most of them "obviously" name scalars, QOM children or QOM links.
There's also crap like "list".  The promising ones are the ones
conforming to QAPI naming rules for types.

Look for them in the schema, drop the enums, and what's left are
non-scalar properties.

Since the type names are whatever the developer made up on the spot, my
search *can* miss non-scalar properties.

I didn't look at targets other than x86_64.

Of the three instances I found, one uses such a qdev property machinery
(what you called "a slightly higher level wrapper"), and two do not.

Not sure what to recommend.
