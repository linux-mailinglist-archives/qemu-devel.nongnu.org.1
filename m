Oh, thanks for this info, my impression of this is stuck in my memory of 2022,
which is the time I wrote the qemu wrapper for riscv-gnu-toolchain,
So I'm still using a rather clumsy way to play with qemu.

It's really good to know this, and I definitely need to update the
script in riscv-gnu-toolchain :)

Yeah, I admit that, I always spend time updating the script for
mapping extension to
extension to qemu option...and it's hard to always be up to date.

One point here is that the ISA string is the official way to represent
the ISA configuration in RISC-V, it would be simpler if we can use the
same string to set up every tool.

To be honest, I was a little hesitant about adding the `arch=<profile>` syntax,
because as you said, `-cpu` is already supported.

My final decision was to add it for alignment with the toolchain interface,
but that's because I'm a toolchain developer.

The first two patches should be less controversial, so I'm okay with
that if we decide to get the first two first :)

The primary motivation for supporting zvl*b/VLEN syntax is to align
with the toolchain interface, allowing users to process both qemu and
the toolchain using a single string, and again, that is the official
way to describe that info in RISC-V ISA spec, so I adding this syntax
sugar in arch=<isa-str>.
