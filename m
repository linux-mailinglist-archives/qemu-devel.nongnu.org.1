Sorry, I was chasing the tail end of Sphinx fixes and fixing up the
standalone Python library which had quite a few problems with its CI, and I
figured I would then backport all of the various problems I encountered to
our CI here; I see you've already been tackling it while I was looking
away... sorry!

(Markus tried to warn me ...)

If there are no objections to moving to 3.9 as the minimum, I certainly
don't mind. Go right ahead and I'll clean up afterwards as part of my
"delint qapi" series in which I'd like to fix quite a few other things that
are currently wonky. In fact, moving to 3.9 as a minimum might make all of
that much easier for me and allow deeper cleanings.
