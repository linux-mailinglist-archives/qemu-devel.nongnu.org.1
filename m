Doesn't that rule out emulating misaligned access in s-mode if you want
to be profile compliant?

Nah, you misunderstand me. I don't care at all about profiles or
checking for compliance with one. I'm only interested in how my software
can check that some feature is (or is not) supported. This creating a name
for something implicit business is not a problem in and of itself, but
putting then into "riscv,isa" is a pointless activity as it communicates
nothing.

Right. That part is fine, but creating extensions for these things we
previously assumed present gives me the impression that creating systems
that do not support these features is valid. IFF that does happen,
removing the string from "riscv,isa" isn't going to be able to
communicate that the feature is unsupported. The commit message here
says:

Which is part of what prompted me here, since they cannot be handled in
the same way that "regular extensions" are.
