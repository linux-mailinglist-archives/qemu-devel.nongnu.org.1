Please double check whether TLS will send magics.  AFAICT, they should.

No.  We need to figure out a way to do that properly, and that's exactly
what I mentioned as one of the core changes we need in this series, which
is still missing.  We may or may not need an ACK message.  Please think
about it.

Please consider the case where multifd recv threads may get scheduled out
on dest host during precopy phase, not getting chance to be scheduled until
postcopy already started running on dst, then the recv thread can stumble
upon a page that was sent during precopy.  As long as that can be always
avoided, I think we should be good.
