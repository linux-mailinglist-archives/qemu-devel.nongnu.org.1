The talk's abstract:

    AMP Virtio: A New Virto Transport for AMP Systems, with Focus on
    Zephyr, Linux, and Xen

    Asymmetric multiprocessing systems are common in automotive,
    Industrial, and mobile markets and are entering the data center
    market as well.  The OpenAMP project strives to make AMP systems
    easier and more standards based.  The OpenAMP project is working on
    a new Virtio transport layer that can be used between cores that do
    not share a hypervisor.  Example systems include: * AMP SOCs running
    running Linux on Cortex-A and Zephyr on Cortex-M, * x86 and Arm
    systems connected via PCIe, both running Linux.  AMP Virtio can also
    be used in Xen and other hypervisors to reduce worse case latency
    and increase freedom of interference (FFI).  These aspects are
    critical in real-time and functionally safe systems.  This
    presentation will cover:
    * Why Virtio for AMP systems
    * What are the problems with the existing virtio transports for AMP
      systems
    * Outline of the transport proposal
    * Prototype software for Zephyr, Linux, and Xen
    * Show various topologies and use cases for Device and Driver
      placement
    * Show portability to other RTOSes and hypervisors.

You're interested in systems that contain multiple cores.  You want to
create a virtio transport to let these cores talk to each other.

Let's talk physical hardware.  The transport needs to go over some kind
of device.  The device could be pretty smart and provide the virtio
transport, or it could be really dumb and provide just enough to let
software running on the core implement the virtio transport.  What do
you have in mind?

You need QEMU to emulate one or more of the devices you have in mind.

Note: emulation is about the guest-facing part of the QEMU device model.
We'll get to the host-facing part in a minute.

Smart device: we know how to emulate virtio devices with various
connectors, such as PCI, CCW, MMIO.

Dumb device: ivshmem-doorbell could serve as a virtual dumb device.
Note that a physical ivshmem would be a bad idea; it's design is rather
poor.  Is this why you're interested in ivshmem?

As is, ivshmem-doorbell comes with a PCI connector.  You want an MMIO
connector.  Fair enough.

Once you have an actual dumb physical device, you're likely better off
emulating that instead of approximating it with ivshmem.

Approximating could still be useful as a stopgap.

I sidestepped an important problem so far: the "asymmetric" in AMP.
When your asymmetric system contains cores with different architectures,
QEMU can't emulate the entire system, because qemu-system-TARGET can
only emulate cores with achitecture TARGET.

I guess you want to work around this limitation by running multiple
qemu-system-TARGETs.  Trouble is you then need to connect them somehow.
ivshmem's host-facing part can connect its qemu-system-TARGET to other
processes, including other qemu-system-TARGETs, and the TARGETs need not
be identical.  Correct?

What if we had a qemu-system that wasn't limited to a single
architecture?  Would you still want to run multiple connected instances
then, or would you simply model your asymmetric system in a single one?
