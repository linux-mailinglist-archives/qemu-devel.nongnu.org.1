So I started looking into this, and I'm a bit unsure about what we want 
this API to look like. What I mean is there isn't a generic RTC 
abstraction in QEMU, likewise there isn't an "RTC" global variable you 
can easily use to hook up some sort of API or ops-like functions like 
cpu_accel does.

One simple solution I'm seeing is making an mc146818-specific API like 
mc146818rtc_synchronize_pre_resume(), and call that directly wrapped 
inside an ifdef CONFIG_MC146818RTC inside system/cpus.c. We can then 
check the sync-on-resume property inside of that helper and optionally 
just return from it if it's not set.

Any objections on this approach? Is there a better way to do this?

Thanks!
