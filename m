I can see usb-hub [PATCH 2], but not "ohci pci host adapter".  Peeking
at the change log below... dropped in v2?

This part isn't mentioned in the cover letter.

There's overlap with QAPI special feature 'deprecated'.

QMP command object_add has argument @qom-type, which is an enumeration
of (user-creatable) object types.  The proper way to mark one of these
deprecated is to tack feature 'deprecated' to it.  It is then subject to
policy set with -compat deprecated-input=XXX, and is visible in
query-qmp-schema.  Modern management applications should already know
how to deal with it there.

This is definitely how we should deprecate user-creatable objects.
Adding a second way to do it seems undesirable to me.

Trouble is QMP command device_add still mostly bypasses QAPI.  Its
argument @driver is a string.

QAPIfying device_add properly has been on our (unwritten) wishlist since
forever.  Kevin (cc'ed) explored it some not too long ago.

I figure you want the means to deprecate devices now rather than after
we figure out how to QAPIfy device_add.  That's fair.

I think we should limit this series just to devices.  It'll become
redundant if we ever succeed at QAPIfying device_add.  No need to worry
about that now.
