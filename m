I suggest emphasizing AI code completion as well (for example Copilot
integrated with Visual Studio Code does it). As such code is not generated
as a result of the prompt but by the "usual" code completion operation, the
developer might not be aware that this is actually AI generated code.

Best regards,
Yan.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; More detail is needed on what an &quot;AI code generator=
&quot; is. Coding<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; assistant tools range from autocompletion to linters to =
