DM_MPATH_PROBE_PATHS can only send I/O to paths in the active path
group, so it doesn't fail over to different path groups. If there are no
usable paths left in the current path group, but there are some in
another one, then the ioctl returns 0 and the next SG_IO would switch to
a different path group, which may or may not succeed. If it fails, we
have to probe the paths in that group, too.

Right. But if they fail with an immediate error, that's really what we
want because it means no I/O that is stuck for a long time.
