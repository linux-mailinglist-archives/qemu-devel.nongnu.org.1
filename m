Hi Gavin,

If the ultimate aim is to support multiple memory errors why not
just do that?  Been a while since I look at how that works, but 
the spec definitely allows it.  I think by just queuing up the errors
and updating the Error Status Address as each one is handled.
I think that's what GHESv2 ack is all about as it prevents the
RAS firmware updating the error record until it is acknowledged
at which point the RAS firmware can report the next one.

Or... Given the usecase above of a 64KiB host page and 4KiB guest
can we inject a single error record with multiple CPER entries and
just handle it all in one go?

Set the Error record header -> section count to 16 and provide
16 Memory Error Sections or equivalent.

Doesn't help with multiple errors in unrelated memory addresses but
maybe removes one problem case.

I've not checked all the information makes it to the right places
however or that we don't end up with a deadlock when multiple vCPU
involved.

If doing the more significant surgery this would involve, I'd
love to see Mauro's series land first as it cleans up a lot of
how HEST is handled etc.
