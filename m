Code that forces us to do arithmetic in order to properly allocate
memory and comes with a big comment explaining how we're dodging
compiler warnings is bad code in my book.

You fail to appreciate that before the RFC series, multifd already
allocated N for the pages. The device state adds another client, so that
would be another N anyway. The problem the RFC tried to solve was that
multifd channels owned that 2N, so the array was added to move the
memory into the client's ownership. IOW, it wasn't even the RFC series
that made it 2N, that was the multifd design all along. Now in hindsight
I don't think we should have went with the memory saving discussion.

Don't get me wrong, I'm very much in favor of what you're doing
here. However, I don't think it's ok to be backtracking on our design
while other people have series in flight that depend on it. You
certainly know the feeling of trying to merge a feature and having
maintainers ask you to rewrite a bunch code just to be able to start
working. That's not ideal.

I tried to quickly insert the RFC series before the device state series
progressed too much, but it's 3 months later and we're still discussing
it, maybe we don't need to do it this way.

And ok, let's consider the current situation a special case. But I would
like to avoid in the future this kind of uncertainty.

2*N, where N is usually not larger than 32 and the payload size is
1k. Yes, I'd trade that off no problem.

As you put above, I agree that the important bits of the original series
have been preserved, but other secondary goals were lost, such as the
more abstract separation between multifd & client code and that is the
ship that has sailed.

That series was not: "introduce this array for no reason", we also lost
the ability to abstract the payload from the multifd threads when we
dropped the .alloc_fn callback for instance. The last patch you posted
here now adds multifd_device_state_prepare, somewhat ignoring that the
ram code also has the same pattern and it could be made to use the same
API.

I did accept your premise that ram+compression is one thing while
device_state is another, so I'm not asking it to be changed, just
pointing out that the RFC series also addressed those issues. I might
not have made that clear back then.

What you have here is certainly an improvement from the current
state. I'm just ranting about the path we took here.
