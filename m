Hi Alex, thanks for your feedback!

The reason I wrote the memory access the way I did is the following: 
Regardless of the state of the CPU, MCD always wants to be able to 
access all memory spaces (here secure and non-secure).

For example, if the CPU is currently in secure mode I still want to be 
able to perform a memory access via the non-secure memory space. This 
access should be successful, if a non-secure memory address is requested 
and unsuccessful, if a secure memory address is requested.

I could not get this decoupled memory access to work using the existing 
cpu_memory_rw_debug(). It only works properly when using the current 
main memory space (e.g. secure when the CPU is in secure mode).

I did not want to make changes to the existing memory functions because 
I think I could not have checked for all repercussions.

Best regards

Nicolas
