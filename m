I have to add it to fdt where needed. For example on pegasos MorphOS 
checks the name of "/" and expects to find bplan,Pegasos2 which is how it 
identifies the machine. So we need a specific name property there which is 
one example when there will be explicit name property in the fdt. Maybe 
it's needed on some other nodes sometimes but normally the default will be 
sufficient but not always.

I put name first to match what OpenFirmware does which returns name first. 
SLOF seems to do everything backwards (maybe a result of parsing the fdt 
to build the device tree) and returns properties with inverted order so 
name is last on SLOF but even then the order is matched by putting name 
first when we return properties in the normal order otherwise it would not 
be in same order when reversed. I don't know if it's significant, some 
guests may expect to get a name first but most would probably look for the 
name not its position. The order now matches OpenFirmware and pegasos2 
SmartFirmware and SLOF backwards so I think name is now where it should be 
so I'd leave it first. The loop may become simpler if we don't skip 
phandle only name, the complexity is mostly from sometimes we need to skip 
both in a row.

I did some tests with SLOF. This is what I get from SLOF:

package 0x1e64a890 /vdevice/v-scsi@71000003:
         slof,from-fdt          0
         reg                    71000003
         device_type            "vscsi"
         compatible             "IBM,v-scsi"
         interrupts             [0x8 bytes, 2 cells]
         [000] 00001103 00000000
         ibm,#dma-address-cells 2
         ibm,#dma-size-cells    2
         ibm,my-dma-window      "q"
         #address-cells         2
         #size-cells            0
         name                   "v-scsi"

This is VOF before patch:

package 0x00001122 /vdevice/v-scsi@71000003:
         phandle                1122
         #size-cells            0
         #address-cells         2
         ibm,my-dma-window      "q"
         ibm,#dma-size-cells    2
         ibm,#dma-address-cells 2
         interrupts             [0x8 bytes, 2 cells]
         [000] 00001103 00000000
         compatible             "IBM,v-scsi"
         device_type            "vscsi"
         reg                    71000003

and this is VOF after patch:

package 0x00001122 /vdevice/v-scsi@71000003:
         name                   "v-scsi"
         #size-cells            0
         #address-cells         2
         ibm,my-dma-window      "q"
         ibm,#dma-size-cells    2
         ibm,#dma-address-cells 2
         interrupts             [0x8 bytes, 2 cells]
         [000] 00001103 00000000
         compatible             "IBM,v-scsi"
         device_type            "vscsi"
         reg                    71000003

Apart from SLOF returning properties backwards this now matches better. 
SLOF or other Open Firmware implementations don't return phandle property 
because that's what you pass to nextprop or getprop to get the property in 
the first place (listed next to package above) and it is returned by 
finddevice so not normally stored as a property. But if Linux would add it 
and it helps Linux to have it there already we can keep it, it did not 
break OSes on pegasos as they only parse properties they need and ignore 
the rest. So I can skip skipping phandle and add that back if it would be 
better for Linux but didn't removing it fixed a warning about it too?

By the way, phandle is identifying the node so can't we use the fdt offset 
for it so we don't have to add phandle properties? Or does offset change 
when editing the fdt? I think libfdt also uses offsets to identify nodes 
so maybe these should be somewhat stable.
