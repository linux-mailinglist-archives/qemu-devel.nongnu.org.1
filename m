The INTR pin corresponds to qemu_irq cpu_intr not the i8259_irq.

I could make that named to make it clearer, now it's the only output gpio 
so did not name it as usually devices that only have one output don't use 
named gpios for that.

I think the problem here is that i8259 does not provide an output gpio for 
this interrupt that the VT82xx could pass on but instead i8259_init() 
needs a qemu_irq to be passed rhat the i8259 model will set. This seems to 
be a legacy init function so the fix may be to Qdev-ify i8259 and add an 
output irq to it then its users could instantiate and connect its IRQs as 
usual and we don't need to create a qemu_irq to pass it to i8259_init().
