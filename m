We commonly assume "value is default implies user didn't touch it",
which is of course wrong unless it's a value the user cannot set.

I think QAPI's explicit 'unstable' and 'deprecated' flags have been a
success.  Their meaning is clear, and they come with documentation
(because adding them without won't compile).

Pushing QOM closer to QAPI when we can makes sense to me.
