With my RHEL hat on, 6 years gives an approximate alignment with
RHEL lifecycles, which have ended up being roughly 3 years apart.
RHEL-N, wants to support all machine types from RHEL-(N-1), so
in the worst case that gives up to 6 years worth of QEMU versions.

5 years could well be enough in many cases, depending on how
frequently RHEL rebases QEMU, but could also trip us up if the
timelines do something unexpected. So 6 years is a bit safer
from Red Hat's POV, if the community is willing.
