OK I've done that now as this also helps with some of the unint warnings 
but I could not get rid of all work arounds completely.

Maybe it depends more on the compiler than host. I still use gcc 10 with 
default -O2 level. Some people found that -O3 and LTO may help a bit but I 
test with default QEMU settings as that may be what most use.
