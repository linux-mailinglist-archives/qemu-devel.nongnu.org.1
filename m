Yep. The good part of "only set p->c if channel fully established" is that
then the migration thread fully owns the ioc as long as set, and no
overwritting possible.

It could be even simpler than that, iiuc.  Note that in the stack showed in
that commit message, it hasn't even reached the async handling:

    Src: (multifd_send_0)
    multifd_channel_connect
      multifd_tls_channel_connect
        multifd_tls_channel_connect
           qio_channel_tls_handshake
              qio_channel_tls_handshake_task <---- async handling provided here..
                qcrypto_tls_session_handshake
                  gnutls_handshake <-------------- but we're still at sync phase..
                       ...
                    recvmsg (Blocking I/O waiting for response)

IMHO it'll be much easier if we can remove those threads.  Please keep the
adventure there, just a heads-up that the async paths seem to have a close
dependency so far on gmainloop contexts, while the migration thread may not
provide that anymore (and I hope we don't introduce anything either; I
think it's better we stick with a full threaded model in migration rather
than event based).

Thanks.  I just sent the pull without them, as I don't yet have plan to
queue them so soon; I'll be accused to abuse the maintainership. :-)

If you think worthwhile, I can still repost them as formal patches later
and put there on the list.  If your explore on a bigger hammer works then I
think we can ignore these two patches.  But if you or anyone thinks we
could have these as good cleanups, we can also merge them first for 9.0 and
leave whatever else for later.

I think it'll still be properly released / called?

Just to make sure we're on the same page: qio_channel_tls_finalize() will
be called on the last ref released.  Then let's discuss error paths on how
this patch affects the last unref.

Before this patch, it will be called until multifd_send_channel_destroy()
as you said when cleanup, because that did the last unref (while your patch
has the "if" where you'll skip the cleanup even if error):

  multifd_send_channel_destroy
    socket_send_channel_destroy
      object_unref

After this patch, that object_unref() will be called in
multifd_channel_connect() directly, and the cleanup code, seeing
p->c==NULL, does nothing later.

I'll pick it up when posting the formal patches, thanks.

Let's see whether above will address your concern.  If not, we can move the
discussion over to that thread.
