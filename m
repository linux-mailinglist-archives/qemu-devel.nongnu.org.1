This patch series has been through months of review and<br>
refinement. It now has end-to-end Reviewed-by: tags and<br>
all code patches but one have Tested-by: tags. No significant<br>
issues have been found via review for some weeks.<br>
<br>
The patch set creates two new subsystems:<br>
hw/display/apple-gfx<br>
hw/vmapple<br>
so it doesn&#39;t fall within the responsibility of existing<br>
maintainers. How do we proceed to get this merged now that<br>
10.0 development is open?<br>
&lt;/meta&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
This patch set introduces a new ARM and macOS HVF specific machine type<br>
called &quot;vmapple&quot;, as well as a family of display devices based on=
 the<br>
ParavirtualizedGraphics.framework in macOS. One of the display adapter<br>
variants, apple-gfx-mmio, is required for the new machine type, while<br>
apple-gfx-pci can be used to enable 3D graphics acceleration with x86-64<br=
>
macOS guest OSes.<br>
<br>
Previous versions of this patch set were submitted semi-separately:<br>
the original vmapple patch set by Alexander Graf included a monolithic<br>
implementation of apple-gfx-mmio. I subsequently reviewed and reworked<br>
the latter to support the PCI variant of the device as well and submitted<b=
r>
the result in isolation. As requested in subsequent review, I have now<br>
recombined this with the original vmapple patch set, which I have updated<b=
r>
and improved in a few ways as well.<br>
<br>
The vmapple machine type approximates the configuration in macOS&#39;s own<=
br>
Virtualization.framework when running arm64 macOS guests. In addition to<br=
>
generic components such as a GICv3 and an XHCI USB controller, it<br>
includes nonstandard extensions to the virtio block device, a special<br>
&quot;hardware&quot; aes engine, a configuration device, a pvpanic variant,=
 a<br>
&quot;backdoor&quot; interface, and of course the apple-gfx paravirtualised=
 display<br>
adapter.<br>
<br>
There are currently a few limitations to this which aren&#39;t intrinsic,<b=
r>
just imperfect emulation of the VZF, but it&#39;s good enough to be just<br=
>
about usable for some purposes:<br>
<br>
=C2=A0* macOS 12 guests only. Versions 13+ currently fail during early boot=
.<br>
=C2=A0* macOS 11+ arm64 hosts only, with hvf accel. (Perhaps some differenc=
es<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0between Apple M series CPUs and TCG&#39;s aarch64 implementati=
on? macOS<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0hosts only because ParavirtualizedGraphics.framework is a blac=
k box<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0implementing most of the logic behind the apple-gfx device.)<b=
r>
=C2=A0* PCI devices use legacy IRQs, not MSI/MSI-X. As far as I can tell,<b=
r>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0we&#39;d need to include the GICv3 ITS, but it&#39;s unclear t=
o me what<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0exactly needs wiring up.<br>
=C2=A0* Due to a quirk (bug?) in the macOS XHCI driver when MSI-X is not<br=
>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0available, correct functioning of the USB controller (and thus=
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0keyboard/tablet) requires a small workaround in the XHCI contr=
oller<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0device. This is part of another patch series:<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0<a href=3D"https://patchew.org/QEMU/20241208191646.64857-1-phi=
l@philjordan.eu/" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://patchew.org/=
QEMU/20241208191646.64857-1-phil@philjordan.eu/</a><br>
=C2=A0* The guest OS must first be provisioned using Virtualization.framewo=
rk;<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0the disk images can subsequently be used in Qemu. (See docs.)<=
br>
<br>
The apple-gfx device can be used independently from the vmapple machine<br>
type, at least in the PCI variant. It mainly targets x86-64 macOS guests<br=
>
from version 11 on, but also includes a UEFI bootrom for basic<br>
framebuffer mode. macOS 11 is also required on the host side, as well<br>
as a GPU that supports the Metal API. On the guest side, this provides<br>
3D acceleration/GPGPU support with a baseline Metal feature set,<br>
irrespective of the host GPU&#39;s feature set. A few limitations in the<br=
>
current integration:<br>
<br>
=C2=A0* Although it works fine with TCG, it does not work correctly<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0cross-architecture: x86-64 guests on arm64 hosts appear to mak=
e<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0some boot progress, but rendering is corrupted. I suspect<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0incompatible texture memory layouts; I have no idea if this is=
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0fixable.<br>
=C2=A0* ParavirtualizedGraphics.framework and the guest driver support<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0multi-headed configurations. The current Qemu integration alwa=
ys<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0connects precisely 1 display.<br>
=C2=A0* State serialisation and deserialisation is currently not<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0implemented, though supported in principle by the framework.<b=
r>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0Both apple-gfx variants thus set up a migration blocker.<br>
=C2=A0* Rendering efficiency could be better. The GPU-rendered guest<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0framebuffer is copied to system memory and uses Qemu&#39;s usu=
al<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0CPU-based drawing. For maximum efficiency, the Metal texture<b=
r>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0containing the guest framebuffer could be drawn directly to<br=
>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0a Metal view in the host window, staying on the GPU. (Similar<=
br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0to the OpenGL/virgl render path on other platforms.)<br>
