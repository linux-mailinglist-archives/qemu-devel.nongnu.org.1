The loop you highlighted does at most 4 reads and errors out if it
doesn't read anything, so I don't think that's it. If it blocks,
something inside of ssh_channel_read() must do that.

Oh, right, I was confused with blocking mode for sftp and for the ssh
session. We have sftp blocking and the session non-blocking for the most
part.

Given that apparently it was always blocking, the patch doesn't make the
situation any worse. I'll apply it for 9.2.
