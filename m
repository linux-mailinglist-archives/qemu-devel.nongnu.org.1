Sure, I'm not implying the change affects non-TLS. I'm just arguing that
non-TLS behavior should not be taken into consideration because it
doesn't ignore any errors anyway.

The whole (and only) point I'm making is what happens when
e.g. multifd_send shuts down the connection prematurely due to a
bug. IIUC, premature_ok would make that be treated as normal EOF in
multifd_recv and that is a problem because any thread that sees an error
should terminate all others instead of just exiting.

Currently, GNUTLS_E_PREMATURE_TERMINATION doesn't abort migration, but
it does cause multifd_recv_terminate_threads() to be executed. The
change from this series will make it so that
GNUTLS_E_PREMATURE_TERMINATION never leads to
multifd_recv_terminate_threads(), while the correct behavior would be to
trigger cleanup always, except for the very last recv().

The multifd recv loop is where I don't want to have RELAXED_EOF. Except
for the last recv() call. Which of course we can't differentiate unless
we use something like gnutls_bye() of MULTIFD_FLAG_EOS as you suggest
below.

Indeed, if MULTIFD_FLAG_EOS is not seen, the recv thread could treat any
EOF as an error. The question is whether we can add that without
disrupting multifd synchronization too much.

There is no compat issue. For <=3D 9.2, QEMU is still doing an extra
multifd_send_sync_main(), which results in an extra MULTIFD_FLAG_SYNC on
the destination and it gets stuck waiting for the
RAM_SAVE_FLAG_MULTIFD_FLUSH that never comes. Therefore the src always
closes the connection before dst reaches the extra recv().

I test migration both ways with 2 previous QEMU versions and the
gnutls_bye() series passes all tests. I also put an assert at
tlssession.c and never triggers for GNUTLS_E_PREMATURE_TERMINATION. The
MULTIFD_FLAG_EOS should behave the same.
