Correct, libvirt hasn't got any impl for 'mapped-ram' yet, at least
not something merged.

Since this is new functionality, libvirt could go straight for the
'file' protocol / address type.

At some point I think we can stop using 'fd' for traditional migration
too and pass the socket address to QEMU and let QEMU open the socket.
