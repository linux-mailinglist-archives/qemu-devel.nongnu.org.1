I'm failing to see what real world technical problems QEMU faces
with a parameter being set to '1' by a mgmt app, when QEMU itself
treats all omitted values as being '1' anyway.

If we're trying to faithfully model the real world, then restricting
the topology against machine types though still looks inherantly wrong.
The valid topology ought to be constrained based on the named CPU model.
eg it doesn't make sense to allow 'dies=4' with a Skylake CPU model,
only an EPYC CPU model, especially if we want to model cache info in
a way that matches the real world silicon better.

As above, I think that restrictions based on machine type, while nice and
simple, are incorrect long term. If we did impose restrictions based on
CPU model, then we could trivially expose this info to mgmt apps via the
existing mechanism for querying supported CPU models. Limiting based on
CPU model, however, has potentially greater back compat issues, though
it would be strictly more faithful to hardware.

With regards,
Daniel
