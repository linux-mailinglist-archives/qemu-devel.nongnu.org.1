Fair point.

Possible counter-points:

* The default is almost always right for the casual user.  The
  exception, as far as I understand, is certain guest OSes refuse to
  play ball with certain devices when they have an MBR.

* The configuration interface isn't exactly casual-user-friendly to
  begin with.  @fat-type, what's that, and why do I care?  @floppy,
  what's that, and why do I care?

Anyway, you decide.

Yes, negative names should definitely be avoided for boolean options.
