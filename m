Yes, it makes sense. This conversion doesn't block the current patch. The
correctness has been guaranteed.

Then I understand we still need `assert!(bql_locked())` in assessor as
the doc said: "it is possible to assert in the code that the right lock
is taken, to use it together with a custom lock guard type, or to let C
code take the lock, as appropriate."
