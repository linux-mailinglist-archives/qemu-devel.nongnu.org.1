This matches the docs in which a figure shows area after CONFIG_MEMSIZE as 
VRAM extension area so 32MB is reserved for VRAM even if there's less on 
the card and the AGP window starts after that.

Question is if Radeon has BAR0 matching VRAM size because in that case if 
Rage128 has fixed 64MB and Radeon has size of VRAM for BAR0 then 
CONFIG_APER_SIZE can be half of BAR0 which would work for both. But if 
Radeon also has a fixed size BAR0 larger than actual VRAM (mathching max 
supported VRAM instead then current calculation is needed using VRAM size 
for radeon according to the FCode ROM I've tested. Changing 
CONFIG_APER_SIZE only for Rage128 should not break anything as I did not 
see anything using that so that would also work if we can't find out what 
Radeon has.
