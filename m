Didn't we change the hosting for our k8s runners recently ? They were
running on Azure, but I vaguely recall hearing that it was being
switched again.

Anyway, perhaps the cloud provider is over-committing the env such
that we have excessive streal time and thus not getting the full
power of the CPUs we expect.  I know gitlab's own public runners
will suffer from this periodically, due to the very cheap VMs they
host on.

With regards,
Daniel
