You mean that the first level will be indexed by only one CPUClass (or 
few if we support a heterogeneous system).

I think it's still OK though. It's not like we will need more code when 
having few entries.

That's the best option in my opinion. gdbstub won't work well with such 
a system anyway, and fixing it will need something similar to 
GHashTable. But if I would fix gdbstub for a heterogeneous system, I 
would add a field to CPUClass instead of having a GHashTable keyed with 
tuples of CPUClass pointers and register numbers. It should be fine 
considering that CPUState already has gdbstub-specific fields like gdb_regs.
