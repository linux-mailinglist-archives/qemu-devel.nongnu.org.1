that's was my concern/suggestion in reply to cover letter

(PS: It looks like I'm having email receiving issues (i.e. not getting from

It's likely /me who to blame for asking to invent generic
device-set QMP command.
I see another application (beside ARM CPU power-on/off) for it,
PCI devices to simulate powering on/off them at runtime without
actually removing device.

wrt command,
I'd use only 'id' with it to identify target device
(i.e. no template matching nor QMP path either).
To enforce rule, what user hasn't named explicitly by providing 'id'
isn't meant to be accessed/manged by user later on.=20

potentially we can invent specialized power_set/get command as
an alternative if it makes design easier.
But then we would be spawning similar commands for other things,
where as device-set would cover it all. But then I might be
over-complicating things by suggesting a generic approach.=20

is there some kind of QMP command to check what does a device support,
or at least what properties it supports? Can we piggy-back on that?

We still do have a few legacy uses of cpu index (CLI|HMP), but
I'd avoid using cpu index or something similar in new interfaces.
