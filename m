We have two parallel structures: QAPI modules and reST sections.

QAPI modules are for developers working on the QAPI schema[1].

reST sections are for readers of the documentation generated from the
QAPI schema.

We intentionally refrained from tying the two together more than
necessary.

The generated documentation is in an order defined by the include
directives.  To get the order you want, you may have to juggle include
directives, and maybe even split up modules.  If this ever gets too
bothersome, we'll provide some other way to order things[2].

You can then add any section structure you want.  You could even start a
section in the middle of one module, and end it in the middle of a later
module.  That would be silly, of course.  My point is: the section
structure need not mirror the module structure.

What does this mean for structuring the generated documentation's index?
If we want to structure it, we should use section structure, not module
structure.

Good observation.  I'd expect readers will want to use the index to look
up the names present in the external interface (commands and events).
Once they found them, they'll likely need to look up types mentioned
there, but they'll want to do so by following links, not going back to
the index.

Hiding types by default makes sense to me.  How exactly to do that is up
to the developer.  Even something as simple & stupid as a link to an
alternate index page could work.

Me neither.  See my argument above.

Yes, please :)

I'm not sure such an index is useful.

[1] Why are modules useful for developers?

The QAPI schema used to be monolithic: one input file
(qapi-schema.json), one output file of each kind (qapi-commands.c,
qapi-events.c, qapi-introspect.c, qapi-types.c, qapi-visit.c, ...).

A single input file is unwiedly, and defeats the MAINTAINERS file.  So
we added support for splitting it up into modules (commit a719a27c824
"qapi: Add a primitive to include other files from a QAPI schema file",
May 2014), and over several years moved *everything* from
qapi-schema.json to submodules it includes.

A single output file per kind eventually took us to "touch the QAPI
schema, recompile the world".  So I changed it to generate one output
file per module for the kinds where that makes sense (commit 252dc3105fc
"qapi: Generate separate .h, .c for each module", Feb 2018).


[2] If the order within a module makes the generated documentation hard
to read, it'll probably make the source file hard to read, too.  So fix
that.
