Yes, I don't think it's a requirement that they live along the C
files. Using rust/hw/... as you did is fine.

Ok, it's good that you agree because that's what I was worried about. :)

Ehh, as you say below it's complicated. Sometimes worse is better.
Personally I wouldn't have minded keeping the v4 approach as a "known
evil"; but if you can make the Cargo subprojects work, that would be
fine for me. What I don't like is the vendoring and handwritten (I
think?) meson.build, I think that's worse than the v4.

No I meant comments where we have known instances of undefined
behavior. The two I had in my emails are

(in pl011_init):
// TODO: this assumes that "all zeroes" is a valid state for all fields of
// PL011State. This is not necessarily true of any #[repr(Rust)] structs,
// including bilge-generated types. It should instead use MaybeUninit.

(before the call to qemu_chr_fe_accept_input):
// TODO: this causes a callback that creates another "&mut self".
// This is forbidden by Rust aliasing rules and has to be fixed
// using interior mutability.

Why do they have to be #[used]? You have

+                #[used]
+                static TYPE_NAME: &::core::ffi::CStr =3D $tname;
+                $tname.as_ptr()

but since the cstr crate (and c"" literal) promise to return a
&'static CStr, I thought it could be just

    $tname.as_ptr()

About traits, I meant something like

pub unsafe trait ObjectType: Sized {
     const TYPE_NAME: &'static CStr;
}

So that you can put the trait declaration in the pl011 crate and the
type_info! macro can do

<$t as ObjectType>::TYPE_NAME.as_ptr()

(also for the parent).

Ah, I see. Anyhow, I've been looking at the Linux kernel's pinned-init
crate (https://rust-for-linux.com/pinned-init) and it provides a
Zeroable macro including #[derive] support. So that has gone lower in
my priority.

I'd still like to give someone else the burden. :) Writing our own
constructor macro would be more work for little gain.

Ah, I meant that it applies to both direct use:

pub static CLK_NAME: &CStr =3D c"clk";

and arguments to macros (for example type_info).

I think it's worth trying it anyway.

Ok, thanks!
