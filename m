Actually, we do parse it, but only in "make check".  See
docs/meson.build.  The cleanup series I just sent covers it.

Unfortunately, this adds another case for you.  In master:

    # @executable: Identifies the firmware executable. The @mode
    #              indicates whether there will be an associated
    #              NVRAM template present. The preferred
    #              corresponding QEMU command line options are
    #                  -drive if=none,id=pflash0,readonly=on,file=@executable.@filename,format=@executable.@format
    #                  -machine pflash0=pflash0
    #              or equivalent -blockdev instead of -drive. When
    #              @mode is @combined the executable must be
    #              cloned before use and configured with readonly=off.
    #              With QEMU versions older than 4.0, you have to use
    #                  -drive if=pflash,unit=0,readonly=on,file=@executable.@filename,format=@executable.@format

My series cleans this up to

    # @executable: Identifies the firmware executable.  The @mode
    #     indicates whether there will be an associated NVRAM template
    #     present.  The preferred corresponding QEMU command line options
    #     are
    #
    #     ::
    #
    #         -drive if=none,id=pflash0,readonly=on,file=@executable.@filename,format=@executable.@format
    #         -machine pflash0=pflash0
    #
    #     or equivalent -blockdev instead of -drive.  When @mode is
    #     @combined the executable must be cloned before use and
    #     configured with readonly=off.  With QEMU versions older than
    #     4.0, you have to use
    #
    #     ::
    #
    #         -drive if=pflash,unit=0,readonly=on,file=@executable.@filename,format=@executable.@format

This uses ReST markup for literal blocks.  There are two forms.

1. A paragraph containing just "::" starts a literal block.

2. A paragraph ending with "::" also starts one.

In either case, the block's contents is indented.

See https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickref.html#literal-blocks
for more.

I think you need to switch literal mode on when you detect a qmp-example
directive or a literal block, and record the line's indentation.  switch
it off at the first line that is no more indented than the recorded
indentation.
