I think hand coded some specific handling for special case is acceptable 
when it's unavoidable. However, an auto-adaptive interface for general 
cases is always better than hand code/hard code something. E.g., current 
QEMU implementation hardcodes the fixed0 and fixed1 information based on 
TDX 1.5.06 spec. When different versions of TDX module have different 
fixed0 and fixed1 information, QEMU will needs interface to get the 
version of TDX module and maintain different information for each 
version of TDX module. It's a disaster IMHO.

For this specific #VE reduction case, I think userspace doesn't need to 
do any hand coding. Userspace just treats the bits related to #VE 
reduction as configurable as reported by TDX module/KVM. And userspace 
doesn't care if the value seen by TD guest is matched with what gets 
configured by it because they are out of control of userspace.
