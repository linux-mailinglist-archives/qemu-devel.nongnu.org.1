I'm not convinced about calling this "not backward compatible".

We're always free to add new commands, and there's never any
guarantee that you can execute a given command under every
possible QEMU configuration.

IOW, adding 'dump-skeys' and having it always return an error
on non-s390x targets is valid IMHO, and I wouldn't call that
a backwards compatibilit problem.

Apps shouldn't assume that just because a command is reported
in introspection, it can be used in any scenario. An app is
expected to itself understand the behaviour of any given command
sufficiently well, to know when they can execute it, or be prpared
to accept errors.

That's not the case though. We've added plenty of conversions of
HMP to QMP, while declaring them unstable. We might have missed
that in some cases, but that's just a bug, and we can fix that
any time by adding the 'unstable' feature tag to the schema.

Debug only, unstable commands are totally valid for QMP. There's nothing
that requires them to be inherantly HMP only.

QAPI modelling can benefit many debug only, unstable commands, but we
can also still just return printf formatted strings as documented here:

  https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/devel/writing-monitor-commands.html#writing-a-debugging-aid-returning-unstructured-text


I remain convinced that we should eventually delete the HMP impl as it
exists today, and just provide a QMP client whose interactive interface
matches what HMP provides today. There's no compelling need for HMP to
run inside QEMU, if QMP exposes all the required functionality.

IMHO we don't need to invent new terms for this.

"unstable" is sufficient as it expresses that the command's
inputs and outputs are liable to change their format, which
is the case for most of the historical debug only commands.

Daniel
