I don't like the extra cast to fdt64_t. Strictly speaking, casting into 
uint64_t * is undefined in the standard and the compiler is free to 
optimize it as an aligned access after the cast. clang and gcc does not 
perform such an optimization, but it is better to avoid such a construct 
if possible.* It is unfortunate that libfdt requires it.

Nevertheless, I won't object to use fdt64_ld() and fdt32_ld(). That's 
what the upstream provides anyway.

Akihiko Odaki
