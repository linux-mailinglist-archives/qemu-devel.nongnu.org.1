What URI?  I know you mean the migration URI, but will readers know?
Elsewhere, we use "migration URI".

Hmm.  That's no good, either: we may not *have* a migration URI since
commit 074dbce5fcce (migration: New migrate and migrate-incoming
argument 'channels') and its fixup commit 57fd4b4e1075 made command
migrate argument @uri optional and mutually exclusive with @channels.

I think we better use more generic terminology here.  Let's have a look
at migrate's documentation for inspiration:

    ##
    # @migrate:
    #
    # Migrates the current running guest to another Virtual Machine.
    #
    # @uri: the Uniform Resource Identifier of the destination VM
    #
    # @channels: list of migration stream channels with each stream in the
    #     list connected to a destination interface endpoint.
    #
    [...]
    # Notes:
    [...]
    #     4. The uri argument should have the Uniform Resource Identifier
    #        of default destination VM. This connection will be bound to
    #        default network.
    #
    #     5. For now, number of migration streams is restricted to one,
    #        i.e. number of items in 'channels' list is just 1.
    #
    #     6. The 'uri' and 'channels' arguments are mutually exclusive;
    #        exactly one of the two should be present.

Perhaps "saves the state to the migration destination"?

>>> +#     directly exec's a new version of QEMU on the same host,
>>> +#     replacing the original process while retaining its PID, and
>>> +#     loads state from the URI.  Guest RAM is preserved in place,

"loads the state from the migration destination"?

We should also fix up existing uses of "migration URI": @mapped-ram,
@cpr-reboot, @tls-hostname.  Not this series' job.  I'll report it
separately.

Maybe "the command to start the new QEMU process"?

Hmm.  @cpr-exec-args is documented like this:

    # @cpr-exec-args: Arguments passed to new QEMU for @cpr-exec mode.
    #    See @cpr-exec for details.  (Since 9.1)

Is it a good idea to keep the details with @cpr-exec?  Let me try not
to.  Replace the "Arguments for the new QEMU process..." paragraph by

    #     The new QEMU process is started according to migration parameter
    #     @cpr-exec-args.

Then document cpr-exec-args like

    # @cpr-exec-args: Command to start the new QEMU process for MigMode
    # @cpr-exec.  The first list element is the program's filename, the
    # remainder its arguments.

What do you think?

Naming the thing "-args" feels questionable.  It's program and
arguments.

For what it's worth, QGA command guest-exec has them separate:

    # @path: path or executable name to execute
    #
    # @arg: argument list to pass to executable

The name @path is poorly chosen.

qmp_guest_exec() then prepends @path to @arg to make the argv[] for the
execve() wrapper it uses.

I figure you'd rather not have them separate, to keep migration
parameters simpler.  Name it @cpr-exec-command?

Worth spelling that out in the doc comment?

With clear errors, no further documentation is needed.  Good :)
