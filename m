Top-posting (Gasp!) to share a gitlab URL where this script is now located.

https://gitlab.com/jsnow/repology-dashboard#

GPL2.0-or-later, barely polished, a bit hacky. Have fun! This script
outputs more data than you've ever wanted to stdout, json and csv.
Suggestions/patches welcome if you find the script useful but clunkily
written (it is clunkily written.) The repo contains all of the sample
output in a data/ folder you can nose around if desired.

I currently have no appetite for trying to get this into qemu.git as a
maintainer scrichvrches nightmarespt, but maybe you do - in which
case, be my guest and change absolutely whatever you want to make it
happen, I do not care and have no pride on the matter. O:-)

--js

P.S. would it maybe be worth reproducing the summary table as-is in
our developer manual as something linked to from the platform policy
page? It will rot over time, but it's still potentially a quite useful
reference and I don't know where else to put it. I know we have a
wiki, but I think the wiki is not really a great source of information
for our project as *most* pages there are quite rotted.
