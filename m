Well, that discussion was related to patch 5 and my understanding is that:
 1. Having @format=3Draw,size=3DxMB forwarding the size to the underlying
VVFAT is not easily doable with our current block architecture.
 2. The @size option for format=3D"raw" is misleading. It should have
been @sliced-size or something close to it. However, it's too late to
change it (or we need to deprecate it in a few releases, but then
outside the scope of this patch).
 3. We want to avoid confusing mistakes, such as forgetting
@format=3Dvvfat and having @size then recognized by @format=3Draw (the
default). Naming the new option differently ensures a clear error.

Side note, I agree that @fat-size is confusing so I'll rename it @fs-size i=
n V3.

Yes, I forgot about that one (though linked to patch 2). If we don't
change the default size of floppy, the existing command lines will
stay as is, hence introducing a new mandatory option is a bad idea.
Overall the tradeoff is "simple default CLI" vs "non-conditional
defaults". Both have pros and cons and I don't have a strong feeling
about which ones should be prefered. So, I'll let you, the
maintainers, decide which one is the best for QEMU, its block devices
and vvfat future ;)
