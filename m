I preferred not having two solution because if they work the same problem
out, then it potentially means one of them might be leftover at some point,
unless they suite different needs.  But I don't feel strongly, especially
if cpr-exec is light if cpr-transfer is there.

As an open source project, Libvirt using it means the feature can be
actively used and tested.  When e.g. there's a new feature replacing CPR we
know when we can obsolete the old CPR, no matter -exec or -transfer.

Close sourced projects can also be great itself but naturally are less
important in open source communities IMHO due to not accessible to anyone
in the community.  E.g., we never know when an close sourced project
abandoned a feature, then QEMU can carry over that feature forever without
knowing who's using it.

It's the same as when Linux doesn't maintain kabi on out-of-tree drivers to
me.  It's just that here the open source virt stack is a huge project and
QEMU plays its role within.

Yes this could be better to justify how small change cpr-exec would need on
top of cpr-transfer, but I'd still wait for some comments from Dan or
others in case they'll chime in, just to avoid sinking your time with
rebases.
