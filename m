Hello Peter,

ok. migrate_has_error() looks safe to use in that case. It works fine
with all the prereq VFIO cleanups (that I didn't send yet) and errors
in the setup of dirty tracking are reported correctly to the migration
core subsystem.

Yes. The socket is closed before calling close_return_path_on_source()
and ms->rp_state.from_dst_file becomes invalid, the shutdown silently
fails (we should maybe report error in qemu_file_shutdown()) and the
return-path thread does not exits.

> IOW, the close() of to_dst_file will not

Yes, that's how I understand the comment :

     /*
      * If this is a normal exit then the destination will send a SHUT
      * and the rp_thread will exit, however if there's an error we
      * need to cause it to exit. shutdown(2), if we have it, will
      * cause it to unblock if it's stuck waiting for the destination.
      */

It's the first time that I look at this code :/ I can't tell. Here is
the closing section :

         qemu_mutex_unlock(&s->qemu_file_lock);
         /*
          * Close the file handle without the lock to make sure the
          * critical section won't block for long.
          */
         migration_ioc_unregister_yank_from_file(tmp);
         qemu_fclose(tmp);
     }


Thanks,

C.
