Yes what you said makes sense, even if we may need to change more than
that..

Currently we'll dump the total amount of mem first before dumping the
ramblocks, that is this line:

        qemu_put_be64(f, ram_bytes_total_with_ignored()
                         | RAM_SAVE_FLAG_MEM_SIZE);

RAMBLOCK_FOREACH_MIGRATABLE() is used in ram_bytes_total_with_ignored(),
hence we need to keep using it for the loop later or the total size will
stop matching..

So if we change, then we'll at least also need to change there.  Either of
such change will be an ABI change.. that goes back to the "common migration
challenge" on compatibilities of old snapshot taken to be loadable on new
QEMUs..  Sad. :(

We do not write to those chunks.. See:

static void pss_find_next_dirty(PageSearchStatus *pss)
{
    RAMBlock *rb = pss->block;
    unsigned long size = rb->used_length >> TARGET_PAGE_BITS;
    unsigned long *bitmap = rb->bmap;

    if (migrate_ram_is_ignored(rb)) {
        /* Points directly to the end, so we know no dirty page */
        pss->page = size;
        return;
    }
    ...
}

So essentially those blobs (bitmap + page chunks) will be reserved but kept
as-is, afaict.  RAM iterator jumps over them.

Likely that's a good news, at least what you raised as concern isn't a
problem so far, it's only the image storage that will be wasted keeping
them zeros.

Yep; that's how I see it too, only that the checks are actually not
safe or at least causing more trouble than help..

Side note: not sure if you noticed, the 2nd check was removed here:

    migration: allow private destination ram with x-ignore-shared

That commit was to enable some share=off memory loading from a share=on
memory snapshot use case, which is pretty interesting.

If we do not have the compatibility issue to consider, I agree with you
that all over ram.c we should only care about "not-ignored", rather than
"migratable".

Now we need to evaluate how bad it is with the current status quo, and
whether we will need a property enabling new streams doing the right thing.
So we can choose to keep this as-is, but introduce a flag only if necessary
and confident we should remove this overhead.
