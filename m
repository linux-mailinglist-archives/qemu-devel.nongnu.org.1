I think you meant cross-migrate=off, which is the current behavior.

I am not suggesting forcing cross-migrate=on or even making it default. 
I have shown four possible scenarios earlier[a]:

1) Migration everywhere
2) Migration on specific machines
3) Migration on some known platforms
4) No migration (migration on nowhere)

Taking the discussion with Peter, I amend 4) as follows:
4*) Migration on one platform (checkpoint/restore)

cross-migrate=on is a complete solution for 1).
2) is dealt with another proposal of mine.[b]
3) can be solved with the -platform proposal by Daniel.[c]
4*) is what QEMU currently implements.
