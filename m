I'm not sure I understand it well either. I think what I was asking about 
is the same as what Thomas asked if this could be avoided to make it 
necessary to allocate two separate ops for this. Looks like from now on 
this ops struct should really loose the endianness value and this should 
be assigned when the ops is added to the io region because that's where it 
decides which endianness is it based on the property added in this series. 
But I don't know if that could be done or would need deeper changes as 
what later uses this ops struct might not have access to the property and 
if we have a single ops struct it may need to be copied to set different 
endianness intstead of just referencing it. So I'm not sure there's a 
better way but I think this change makes an already cryptic boiler plate 
even more confusing for people less knowledgeable about QEMU and C 
programming so it makes even harder to write devices. But as long as it's 
just a few devices that need to work with different endianness then it 
might be OK. But wasn't that what NATIVE_ENDIAN was meant for? What can't 
that be kept then?
