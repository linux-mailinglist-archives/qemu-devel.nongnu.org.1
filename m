Virtio devices are not the only one who will need to be extended to 
support such a scenario.
What happens when a disk or network card is added to the machine?
Should it be shared?
Should it be mapped only for one cpu address space?
Should address spaces be mixed or independent?
Per cluster, per cpu, per architure?

Having a concrete prototype will allow us to answer to those questions, 
and many others, and find solutions for the situations we meet.

An important mantra will be to keep that compatible with existing 
command line (potentially extending it to support those new use cases, 
in both the existing *and* the new binary).

The last thing we want to introduce is "yet another QEMU".
