I didn't forget but I lacked the time in this release cycle. Sorry
about that.

I have one quick comment though. There are already a few models
implementing SPI controllers in QEMU. When I skimmed through the
patches, I was surprised to see no use of the available SSI
framework. Doesn't the current framework fit your needs ?

Please take a look at files in : include/hw/ssi/* hw/ssi/*

Same comment for the Serial EEPROM model. This device is generic
and not POWER specific. It should be possible to attach the device
model on other machines and different SPI bus provided by QEMU.
This doesn't mean rewriting everything, but the "HW" interface
probably needs to be reworked. It would make it easier to write
unit test (see ests/qtest/) and ease the review also.

Thanks,

C.
