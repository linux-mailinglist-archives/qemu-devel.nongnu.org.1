User-visible changes between releases need to be documented in release
notes and the manual.  Don't for changes within a release, instead
update documentation to reflect the new state of things.

Regardless, do explain the change in the commit message.

Specifics are more helpful than such generalities, so let me try despite
my relative ignorance of the subject matter.

1. Update the description of @deprecated-props to match the new code.
Ask yourself what people need to know to use this interface.

2. Explain in the commit message how semantics of @deprecated-props
change in this patch.
