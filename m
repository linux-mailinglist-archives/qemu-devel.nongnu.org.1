Ok, I see what you mean - you would like the xchg to be an
xchg_release essentially.

There is actually one case in which skipping the xchg has an effect.
If you have the following:

- one side does

  s.foo =3D 1;
  qemu_event_set(&s.ev);

- the other side never reaches the qemu_event_reset(&s.ev)

then skipping the xchg might allow the cacheline for ev to remain
shared. This is unlikely to *make* a difference, though it does
*exist* as a difference, so I will review the patch, but I really
prefer to place it last.  It's safer to take a known-working
algorithm, apply it to all OSes (or at least Linux and Windows), and
only then you refine it. It also makes my queue shorter.

Ok, nice.  So it's really just NetBSD in the end.

Understood.  For me it wasn't really about performance, but more about
understanding exactly which reorderings can happen and what
synchronizes with what. Load-acquire/store-release are simpler to
understand in that respect, especially since this use of condvar,
without the mutex in reset, is different from everything else that
I've ever seen.
