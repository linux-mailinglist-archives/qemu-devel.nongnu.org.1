In v1 most of the commenters said they would prefer to see FEAT props
instead of IDREG field props. I think we shall try to go in this
direction anyway. As you pointed out there will be some cases where FEAT
won't be enough (CTR_EL0 is a good example). So I tend to think the end
solution will be a mix of FEAT and ID reg field props.

Personally I would smoothly migrate what we can from ID reg field props
to FEAT props (maybe using prop aliases?), starting from the easiest 1-1
mappings and then adressing the FEAT that are more complex but are
explictly needed to enable the use cases we are interested in, at RedHat:
migration within Ampere AltraMax family, migration within NVidia Grace
family, migration within AmpereOne family and migration between Graviton3/4.

We have no info about other's use cases. If some of you want to see some
other live migration combinations addressed, please raise your voice.
Some CSPs may have their own LM solution/requirements but they don't use
qemu. So I think we shall concentrate on those use cases.

You did the exercise to identify most prevalent patterns for FEAT to
IDREG fields mappings. I think we should now encode this conversion
table for those which are needed in above use cases.

From a named model point of view, since I do not see much traction
upstream besides Red Hat use cases, targetting ARM spec revision
baselines may be overkill. Personally I would try to focus on above
models: AltraMax, AmpereOne, Grace, ... Or maybe the ARM cores they may
be derived from. According to the discussion we had with Marc in [1] it
seems it does not make sense to target migration between very
heterogeneous machines and Dan said we would prefer to avoid adding
plenty of feat add-ons to a named models. So I would rather be as close
as possible to a specific family definition.   

Thanks

Eric
