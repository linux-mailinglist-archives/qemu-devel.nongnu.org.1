Hi Alex, Peter, Pierrick:


Thank you all again for the outstanding feedback.


As Peter said in mail 
[1](https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/CAFEAcA92dTDn+Zf-GZVv9zQ3_mwJHZY5hrkdgrRyE7XUio4Sjw@mail.gmail.com/):

And Alex's guidance in another 
mail [2](https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/87jz0gxw01.fsf@draig.linaro.org/):

You nailed the core problem. I hadn't properly thought through the 
separation of concerns, leading to a device that was doing work it 
shouldn't. As Alex pointed out in [2], this architectural refactoring 
allows us to build a generic iommu-testdev to ensure good code re-use. 
This elevates the work from a single-purpose tool into a framework that 
can benefit all IOMMU implementations, which I understand is a far more 
valuable contribution.


Furthermore,  Pierrick's comment in mail 
[3](https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/792a06cd-302c-46a5-997c-026cb67f8f2e@linaro.org/):

Also as Alex said in mail 
[4](https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/87ecqoxohg.fsf@draig.linaro.org/):

The goal is to avoid "accidentally rewriting a driver." Instead, we 
should start simple and provide "targeted unit tests." The idea of 
setting up a simple, static state ("a page or two") to verify atomic 
features and edge cases that are hard to trigger in a dynamic OS is 
exactly the right philosophy for this framework.


Based on this, my plan for V3 maybe now much clearer:

- Refactor the device: It will be renamed iommu-testdev and become a 
"dumb," generic DMA engine. All architecture-specific logic, including 
the construction of page tables and other structures, will be moved into 
the qtest.

- Abstract for reuse: Following Peter's and Alex's advice, the 
table-building logic will be abstracted into reusable helper functions 
within the libqos/ library.

- Limit the initial scope: As you all suggested, the first set of tests 
will be simple unit tests, focusing on the core paths like different 
security states and translation stages


One final question to manage the scope of this large refactoring: my 
plan is to implement the generic iommu-testdev framework in V3, but 
provide only the SMMUv3-specific qtest helpers and tests for now. We can 
leave the implementation for other architectures (like VT-d) to future 
work. Does this seem like a reasonable approach?

Thanks again for helping to shape this work.

Best regards,

Tao
