An AMP SOC is one use case.  A PCIe card with an embedded Cortex-M would 
be another.

On top of ivshmem.  It is not the only use case but it is an important one.

I just gave a talk on this subject at EOSS.  If you would like to look 
at the slides they are here:

Thanks,
Bill

>> Now for ivshmem-flat.  We want to expand this model to include MCU like CPUs and RTOS'es that don't have PCIe.  We focus on Cortex-M because every open source RTOS has an existing port for one of the Cortex-M machines already in QEMU.  However they don't normally pick the same one.  If we added our own custom machine for this, the QEMU project would push back and even if accepted we would have to do a port for each RTOS.  This would mean we would not test as many RTOSes.
