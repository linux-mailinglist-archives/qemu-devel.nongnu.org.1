It's odd that the commit message is longer but there are a few reasons:
1. It describes why the old documentation is wrong. Some of such 
statements are replaced with the reference to docs/devel/memory.rst to 
make them shorter.

2. It contains information that is already described in the existing 
documentation for context.

In this particular case, the owner is already described in 
docs/devel/memory.rst extensively.

I wrote the title looking at other comments that describes the owner as 
"the object that tracks the region's reference count", which implies the 
region's reference count is part of the owner.

But it is confusing to to describe the owner as "the object that tracks 
the region's reference count" in the first place. A memory region has 
its own reference count that can be used to express references internal 
to the owner (and actually used in the following patch).

With v6 I have just sent, I changed to describe the owner as "the object 
that keeps the region alive". The title of this function now says "add a 
reference to the owner of a memory region".

I replaced "add 1 to ~'s reference count" with "add a reference to" to 
make in concise (to fit into 80 columns in particular). I think it's 
fine not to mention the use of counter as it is an implementation detail 
users don't have to care.

With v6, I also noted that this function does nothing when the owner is 
not present in the comment body as suggested.

I modified the comment to tell that this function may destroy the owner 
along with the memory region in v6.
