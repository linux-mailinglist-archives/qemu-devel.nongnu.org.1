The major challenge when I was working on that (as far as I can still
remember..): some devices are created at early stage of QEMU startup, which
can happen before the vIOMMU is created and realized.  Then it can be
challenging to re-parent those devices to be childrens of the vIOMMU, or we
may need a way to create vIOMMU always earlier than those..

Yes, we can go for a lightweight solution.
