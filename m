My bad. I misunderstood your point. It will be fixed by using APIs from
"hw/registerfields.h" as suggested by Philippe in another reply.

   ...
   FIELD(ACPI_GEBS, MULTIPLE_CORRECTABLE, 3, 1)
   FIELD(ACPI_GEBS, ERROR_DATA_ENTRIES, 4, 10)

   then use FIELD_DP32() to only set the correct bits.

Thanks,
Gavin
