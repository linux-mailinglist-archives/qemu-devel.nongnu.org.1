Yes, it's good to make everything clear and I think it's better to
include your extra patch into this series to help maintainer review/pick
in one goes.

I see. I think it's enough to document missing CPUIDs in comment.

v1 is not the final product, then I think it's not necessary to upstream
it. For example, these Intel CPU models are basically all targeted at
the final products. But unluckily, engineering samples may have bugs so
we have to add or remove features based on what the final products
support. So if the final product is clear from the beginning, there's no
need to take intermediate steps.

BTW, even with v2, user can still enable smap by +smap.

Could we make Shijidadao-Client as a v2 of Shijidadao-Server, and create an
alias for this v2?

.alias = "Shijidadao-Client"

Then we could rename Shijidadao-Server to Shijidadao, and its v2 is for
client.

The main use case for CPU models is to easy migration across mixed CPU
clusters [*]. So, IMO, not all products require a model.

Thanks for your patience and sorry for my late reply.
