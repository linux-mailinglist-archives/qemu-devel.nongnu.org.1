A bit of history: POSIX defined ioctl() because of the old Solaris
STREAMS interface, that ended up deprecated in Issue 7 (2004) and
removed in Issue 8 (just released this year).  So POSIX no longer
specified a signature for ioctl().  Admittedly, it DID add a new
interface posix_devctl() designed to be a "portable" replacement for
what ioctl() did (by being a new interface, there is no longer a
question on what type it has), with the intent that libraries will
eventually implement it (perhaps as a wrapper around the real ioctl),
and that one uses 'int' for the command, and replaces the varargs of
ioctl with a more direct specification of pointer and length.

Arguably, that's a bug in glibc for being self-inconsistent.

And there's more of the history, which didn't become apparent until
64-bit architectures became common, but where we now have fallout like
this thread.

For the record, despite POSIX having picked a signed type, I am
totally in favor of an unsigned type in any of our uses.

Maybe s/POSIX/older POSIX/ (given that newer POSIX does not specify
