Agreed with above analysis,
we shouldn't have host_cpu_enable_cpu_pm() as kvm_arch_get_supported_cpuid
gets us MWAIT already.

filling in cpu->mwait.ecx is benign mistake which likely doesn't
trigger anything if CPUID_EXT_MONITOR is not present.
But for clarity it's better to add an explicit check there as well.

There is no problem with warning, I'd even say it's a good thing.
But you are right reordering just masks the issue.

As for expected behavior, if user asked for "-overcommit cpu-pm=on"
there are 2 options:
   * it's working as expected (mwait exiting is enabled successfully with CPUID MONITOR bit set)
   * QEMU shall fail to start.
