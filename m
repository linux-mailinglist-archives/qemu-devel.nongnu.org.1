I did some quick test with running MorphOS demo iso with pegasos2 which 
plays a startup sound. Without this patch the sound is choppy when using 
alsa backend but correct with the patch applied. I don't know how to test 
underruns or overruns but since the sound is not choppy with this patch I 
think this is handled better than in poll mode. When stopping and 
restarting QEMU with stop/cont in monitor while sound is playing I once 
got this error after stopping:
alsa: Failed to write 1648 frames from 0x55eb1fe09500
alsa: Reason: File descriptor in bad state
but other than this error sound seems to stop and continue and did not get 
more errors on subsequent start stop. I don't know if this is enough 
testing or what this means but that's the best I could do for now. I think 
since sound is very much broken without this patch this is an improvement 
in any case. If some problem is discovered later it can be fixed but at 
least this makes it usable with alsa without extra command line tweaking 
as the default is completly unusable.
