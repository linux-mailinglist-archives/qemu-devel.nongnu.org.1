Thank you for taking me through this history, I see the intent of
designing the embedded device structure in this way!

Very cool! May I ask a few more questions? :-) The feedback on this
series looks very positive, and it seems you were almost close to merge
it at the time. What ultimately led you to decide against it? If we
revisit the issue of Rust's private/pub visibility, I'm curious if we
would face the same dilemma again.
