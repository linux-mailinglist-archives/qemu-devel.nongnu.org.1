Positively!

Or rather several QMPs.

qemu-ga's protocol differs in certain details for historical reasons.  A
new one should not.

QMP supports introspection via query-qmp-schema.  This enables clients
to deal with a wide range of server versions.  You don't need this if
your interface never changes (a rather bold assertion), or your client
always targets one specific version.  If you need it, I'm happy to
advise on how to use it.
