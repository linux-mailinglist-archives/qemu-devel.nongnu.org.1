Agreed, but also need to drop the fuzz_dma_read_cb().
However given the first thing that is checked by the only in tree fuzzing
code is whether we are dealing with RAM, I think that's fine.

I had the same thought originally but couldn't convince myself that there
was no route to end up with a different MR here. I don't yet
have a good enough grip on how this all fits together so I particularly
appreciate your help.

With hindsight I should have called this out as a question in this patch set.

Can drop passing in cache as well given it is no longer used within
this function.

Thanks,

Jonathan
