Yes, delegating the FDT creation to the device, instead of having each machine
to create the (mostly) same FDT code over and over again, is something that
I've considering for awhile.

I keep postponing it mainly because I would like to verify with the DT folks if
there's a guarantee that a given device/CPU DT is always the same, i.e. a device
DT is always the same regardless of the machine. I have a guess that that this is
indeed the case but a confirmation would be nice .... Conor, care to comment?


In this refactor we could then create FDTs by passing along a memmap pointer and
a fdt pointer, as you've suggested.


All this said, there's no need to do such FDT refactory all at once. I think I'll
start with the most common devices between RISC-V boards and go from there.

Thanks,

Daniel
