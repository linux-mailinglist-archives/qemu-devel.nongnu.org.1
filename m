Thanks for checking, so this bug happens when you have mapping for file,
and the clusters are not contiguous.

For example, a file with clusters `12, 13, 15`, here when trying to
read from cluster 15, it will get the offset in the file by using 
the formula `cluster_size * (15-12)` (`12` is the first cluster).

This is of course is not correct, and will result in error reading the
file from outside the range.

The reason it wasn't clear when you tested it, is that since I'm
modifying `large2.txt`, and its the last file in the disk, when trying
to allocate new clusters, coincidentally, the new clusters are allocated
after the last cluster of that same file, so the issue wasn't triggered.

I'll modify the test to use the other file, so that we can trigger the
issue.

I'll also modify the other suggestions you had in the other patches and
submit a new version.

Amjad
