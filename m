Looks like a hack. So we have bdrv_co_is_zero_fast() which do pass want_zero=false to block-status. But in case of mirror, which want to check the whole disk, we actually want want_zero=true, and detect it by offset=0..

Isn't it better to add a kind of bdrv_is_zero_middle_speed() (which means, don't try to read the data to check, but be free to use suboptimal lseek call or something like this), which will pass want_zero=true, and use it from mirror? Mirror case differs from usage in qcow2 exactly by the fact that we call it only once.


Another doubt (really weak): can this one extra lseek be so slow, that mirror becomes worse?
Den, is it right, that problems about slow lseek (that we experienced several years ago) were about qcow2-internals, and nothing related to mirror itself? May one lseek call on mirror target break something?
