Stalls present without this patch and they are much worse than with your
patch. Without your patch - unmaping stalls for 50-100ms, with your
patch - unmapping stalls for 2-20ms.

There are no stalls at all with patches from Alex, unmapping finishes
instantly and performance is ideal.

Correct, scanout commands are blocked.

Running pretty much any VK application with venus reproduces the
problem. A simple reproduction case is to run vkmark with venus, it
would noticeably stall between switching benchmark modes and when app quits.

With native contexts the problem is much more visible. Running any
Desktop Environment (KDE Plasma in my case) on guest with amd/intel nctx
would be freezing badly by moving application window around desktop.
