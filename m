I don't know. But even if not, the only thing customers can actually 
reason about is a combined hash of firmware + kernel + initrd + cmdline. 
Whether we assemble that using an edk2 IGVM plus parameters or by 
generating an IGVM from a "proprietary format" such as the edk2 BIOS 
blob plus a generated kernel hash page does not really make a difference 
from the user's point of view.

The flow will be the same: You use ukify to generate a FUKI from source 
files and get a FUKI plus precalculated hashes.

If your distro embraces UKIs today, they should IMHO also embrace 
prebuilt FUKIs. Whether they are building their IGVM on the fly but 
precalculate the hash for that on-the-fly generated image ahead of time 
or whether they embed an IGVM is not terribly important I think.

The main difference between the 2 approaches is that dynamic generation 
allows you to have multiple different environment builds in a single 
FUKI. That way you can for example support UKI addons [1]

You can only (sensibly) handle them with on the fly generation.

IGVM would replace the region list I think. Before making that jump, I 
would like to see it actually work though.
