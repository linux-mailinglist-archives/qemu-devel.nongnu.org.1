Hah, decided to send offlist, but forget to clear CC. Sorry. However, nothing secret here.

Moreover, interesting, what do all think about a cpr-exec variant with loading QEMU as library instead of doing exec.

I mean, may be you may quickly answer "don't try, you'll have to bring more than 100 commits from different series", or visa-versa "we have downstream based on 7.2 too, so it's possible" (OK, seems the latter answer is not possible, as iommufd code just absent in v7.2).

I read the discussion on cpr-exec, seems the main problem was the security constraint, that we don't want to allow exec call in seccomp profile. Didn't you consider a variant with loding the library instead of exec?
