Of course, I didn't mean to imply that. I just saying that using /tmp
would have been fine with me and I don't want to get in the way.

Interesting, good to know.

Here we have each of the 5 migration archs taking up some amount of
memory + each of the 3 supported arches for ivshmem. They all could be
running in parallel through make check. In practice there's maybe less
overlap due to timing and not all CI jobs building all archs, but still.

Or just leave ignore_shared untouched for the ppc series.
