I think now we understand each other. Let me try to rephrase: We're
trying to add a QEMU "debug" monitor which is used to debug the emulated
system. The debug monitor is built on the MCD API as the debug protocol
and QMP as the transport protocol and runs in parallel to the QEMU
monitor which is used to control the emulator. Since the QEMU monitor is
also built on QMP, we can reuse as much as possible from its QMP code
but have to be careful not to add any coupling that goes beyond the
transport layer.

If I understood you correctly, I would feel prepared to go to work and
try it out. If problems come up, I would get back to you.

There are two types of connections in MCD. mcd_open_server_f opens the
connection to the MCD implementation, i.e. mcdserver, and initializes
mcdserver's core database. The actual debugging is performed over core
connections opened by mcd_open_core_f. Each core connection will be
identified by a pointer to a mcd_core_st object in the MCD API and by an
uint32_t holding a unique identifier over the RPC protocol.

In homogeneous multi-core systems, we can get away with one server
connection and multiple core connections. In heterogeneous systems, we
need multiple server connections since most likely multiple debuggers
have to be connected to QEMU simultaneously.

While there are use-cases to opening multiple connections to the same
core at once, I would propose to keep this is as a future option but not
to include this in the initial commits since it considerably complicates
things.

Since both gdbserver and QMP monitor run in the main thread, I don't see
a reason why not to run the mcdserver in there as well.

As there are no explicit locks in gdbstub.c, I assume they are enforced
by QEMU's infrastructure.

No, none that I'm aware of.
