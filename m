The PowerNV did run with 64 CPUs at some point. Boot was slow bc of
contention in some areas when starting the secondaries. When stabilized,
perf was decent.

I think that a realistic goal for book3s is to support 2 sockets * 2 cores
* 4 threads on PowerNV and 16 vCPUs on pseries, this to exercise the various
ways to IPI on the different HV implementations.

May be there is some value to store a CPU siblings under the PowerPC
CPU descriptor. IT could be useful for instructions that apply to the
current CPU but for others requiring a PIR value, you will have to
find a starting point in the CPU list, so it won't make much difference
I think.

Thanks,

C.
