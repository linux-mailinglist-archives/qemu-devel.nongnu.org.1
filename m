That's right. I will try to see whether it is possible to do a dev->hotplug=
ged
check here.

Why do we need IORT mappings to be refreshed during hotplug?
AFAICS, the mappings are created per host bridge Ids. And how is this
different from a host machine doing hotplug?

We had some discussion on this "at least one vfio-pci" restriction
for accelerated mode previously here.
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/Z6TtCLQ35UI12T77@redhat.com/#t

I am not sure we reached any consensus on that. The 3 different approaches
discussed were,

1. The current one used here. At least one cold plugged vfio-pci device
   so that  we can retrieve the host SMMUV3 HW_INFO as per current
  IOMMUFD APIs.

2. A new IOMMUFD API to retrieve HW_INFO without a device.=20

3. A fully specified vSMMUv3 through Qemu command line so that we
   don't need HW_INFO from kernel.

We're going with option one for now, but completely blocking hotplug
because of it  feels a bit too restrictive to me.

The real issue (for now), as I see it, is that we need some way to remember
the Guest SMMUv3 <-> Host SMMUv3 mapping after the guest has booted.
That way, even if all devices tied to a Guest SMMUv3 get hot-unplugged,
QEMU can still block attaching a device that belongs to a different Host
SMMUv3.

Thanks,
Shameer
