=== vhost-user devices in Rust on macOS and *BSD ===

'''Summary:''' Extend rust-vmm crates to support vhost-user devices 
running on POSIX system like macOS and *BSD

VIRTIO devices can be emulated in an external process to QEMU thanks to 
the vhost-user protocol, which allows QEMU to offload the entire 
emulation to a daemon. This is done through an AF_UNIX socket used as a 
control path between the frontend (i.e. QEMU) and the backend (i.e. the 
vhost-user daemon). QEMU will share guest memory with the daemon, 
provide all the information for data path setup, and notification 
mechanisms.

Moving the emulation of VIRTIO devices to a separate process from QEMU 
offers significant advantages, primarily in terms of safety, if a device 
crashes, we can restart it without affecting QEMU. Additionally, this 
approach simplifies updating device implementations, allows development 
in other languages (such as Rust as we do in the rust-vmm community), 
and enhances isolation through seccomp, cgroups, and similar mechanisms.

The rust-vmm community already provides several crates (e.g. vhost, 
vhost-user-backend, etc.) to implement a vhost-user backend in an 
external daemon. For example, these crates are used by virtiofsd 
(virtio-fs vhost-user device) but also by all vhost-user devices 
maintained by the rust-vmm community in the rust-vmm/vhost-device 
workspace. These crates work great on Linux, but unfortunately they use 
some Linux-specific system calls such as epoll(7) and eventfd(2) that 
make them impossible to use on other POSIX systems.

The goal of this project is to make sure that we can use rust-vmm's 
vhost and vhost-user-backend crates on other POSIX systems besides 
Linux. If time permits, we could also fix up simple devices such as 
vhost-device-console or vhost-device-vsock to run on any POSIX systems.

'''Tasks:'''
* Becoming familiar with QEMU and vhost-user devices
* Run QEMU with a vhost-user device on macOS or FreeBSD/OpenBSD as 
covered in the FOSDEM 2025 talk
* Analyze rust-vmm crates (vmm-sys-util, vhost, vhost-user-backend) to 
understand which components are Linux-specific
* Replace epoll(7) with alternatives such as 
https://github.com/smol-rs/polling
* Automatic fallback to pipe()/pipe2() if eventfd(2) is not available as 
QEMU already does
* Handle any other cases discovered during the analysis
* Adapt a simple device such as vhost-device-console or 
vhost-device-vsock to test that everything works on macOS or 
FreeBSD/OpenBSD
