Ah yes, the SVM_SEV_FEAT_DEBUG_SWAP feature is the one I couldn't remember
the name of in my quoted text above, that break our apps when the kernel
suddenly set it by default (thankfully now reverted in Linux with
5abf6dceb066f2b02b225fd561440c98a8062681).

Yes, the difficulty in diagnosis is the big thing I'm worried about from
a distro supportability POV. The DEBUG_SWAP issue caused us a bunch of
pain and that's before CVMs are even widely used.

I agree that hardcoding checks in QEMU is pretty unpleasant, and probably
not something that I'd want us to do. I'd want QEMU to be able to live
query the kernel's default initial VMSA, if it were to be reporting
differences vs the IGVM provided VMSA. I dn't think there's a way to
do that nicely though - i only know of ftrace probes to dump it informally.

I guess if we know & document what subset of the VMSA QEMU /can/ directly
control, that at least narrows down where to look if something does change
or go wrong.

I'll delegate to Paolo for an opinion on the possiblity of new (or
updated) ioctls to provide the full VMSA data.

If we can't directly set the full VMSA, then next best option is a
more formal way query to VMSA. That way libvirt could report on
what the default initial kernel VMSA state is, which could be useful
debug info for any bug reports.

With regards,
Daniel
