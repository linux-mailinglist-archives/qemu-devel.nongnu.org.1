They can't invalidate the instruction currently being executed?
I'll experiment a bit more.

Okay. I suspect *most* of the time even the strict SMC archs would
not be writing to the same page they're executing either. But I can
start with the !SMC.

Interesting.

Yeah, actually Linux is throwing the messages a bit more recently
at least on distros that enable page clearing at alloc for security,
because that clearing is a big chunk that can happen in critical
sections.

Thanks for the suggestion, I'll give it a try.

Thanks,
