Yes, I think it makes sense to maintain that information upstream.  It
is useful information to have.  Even if upstream isn't going to enforce
something qemu could print useful hints.

So, the question is whenever we want go for a simple bool, or go for a
bitfield giving more detailed information.  Bits I think could be
useful:

  (1) OBJECT_STATUS_DEPRECATED
      Stuff we actually want remove.  Very few cases, maybe usb-hub.

  (2) OBJECT_STATUS_UNSAFE
      "not very maintained".  Probably need a better name for this.

  (3) OBJECT_STATUS_OUTDATED
      Old device where newer / better alternatives exist.

Looking at the USB host adapters I'd attach 2+3 to ohci and 3 to uhci
and ehci.  In general there is a lot of overlap for (2) + (3) though.

We might also have recommendation bits such as:

  (4) OBJECT_STATUS_VIRTUALIZATON
      Devices recommended for virtualization use cases
      (all virtio, xhci, ...).

When doing it at ObjectClass not DeviceClass level we get introspection
support for (almost) free, so I'd do it for ObjectClass even if the vast
majority of users will be devices.

Sounds like having OBJECT_STATUS_DEPRECATED makes sense even if we don't
have any device actually using that.

take care,
  Gerd
