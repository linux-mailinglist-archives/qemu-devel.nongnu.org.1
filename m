This seems pretty new hardware features.  I didn't check in depths but what
you said makes sense.

It may not matter much (where I also see your below comments), but just to
mention another solution to avoid this read is that we can maintain
RAMBlock->receivedmap for precopy (especially, multifd, afaiu multifd
doesn't yet update this bitmap.. even if normal precopy does), then here
instead of scanning every time, maybe we can do:

  /*
   * If it's the 1st time receiving it, no need to clear it as it must be
   * all zeros now.
   */
  if (bitmap_test(rb->receivedmap, page_offset)) {
      memset(page, 0, ...);
  } else {
      bitmap_set(rb->receivedmap, page_offset);
  }

And we also always set the bit when !zero too.
    
My rational is that it's unlikely a zero page if it's sent once or more,
while OTOH for the 1st time we receive it, it must be a zero page, so no
need to scan for the 1st round.

Do you have a rough estimate on how slow that could be? It'll be good to
mention some details too in the doc file in that case.

Right, that complexity may not be necessary, in that case, maybe such
suggestion is fine.
