Can you give more context on what exactly you're doing that it reads the
entire disk image just to resize it? This sounds completely unexpected
and if it does, there may be a different problem to be solved.

In my test, for a raw image, I see a single ftruncate() call, which is
unnecessary, but shouldn't cause any measurable time difference for the
qemu-img run. qcow2 has a little more code in QEMU to figure out that
there is nothing to do, but it doesn't involve any syscall and certainly
not reading the whole image.
