I hope migration tests are not too obstructive yet so far :) - this
discussion is still within a context where we might add one more slow test
in CI, and we probably simply should make it a -m slow test.

E.g. unix is missing, and I'm not sure which we use for e.g. kubevirt.

And note that even if unix shares the socket iochannel with tcp, it may not
work the same.  For example, if you remember I mentioned I was looking at
threadify the dest qemu receive side, i have a draft there but currently it
has a bug to hang a unix migration, not tcp..

So IMHO it's not easy to justify which we can simply drop, if we still want
to provide some good gating in CI.  And I won't be 100% surprised if some
other non-migration PR (e.g. io/) changed some slight bit that unix is
broken and tcp keeps working, for example, then we loose some CI benefits.

This is true.  We can try to discuss more on which is more important; I
still think something might be good to be added on top of above.

There's also the other way - at some point, I still want to improve
migration-test run speed, and please have a look if you like too at some
point: so there's still chance (average is ~2sec as of now), IMHO, we don't
lose anything in CI but runs simply faster.

On RH side Bandan is looking at it, but he's during a long holidays

IIUC it's hard to say - when the test is in CI maintainers can catch them
already before sending a formal PR.

If the test is run by default in make check, a developer can trigger a
migration issue (with his/her patch applied) then one can notice it
introduced a bug, fix it, then post the patches.  We won't know whether
that happened.

So one thing we can do (if you think worthwhile to do it now) is we shrink
the default test case a lot as you proposed, then we wait and see what
breaks, and then we gradually add tests back when it can be used to find
breakages.  But that'll also take time if it really can find such tests,
because then we'll need to debug them one by one (instead of developer /
maintainer looking into them with their expertise knowledge..).  I'm not
sure whether it's worthwhile to do it now, but I don't feel strongly if we
can still have a reliable set of default test cases.
