I had an impression that you mixed up "finalize()" and "free()" in the
context of our discussion.. let us clarify this first before everything
else below, just in case I overlook stuff..

MR is very special as an object, in that it should have no free() hook,
hence by default nothing is going to be freed when mr->refcount==0.  It
means MRs need to be freed manually always.

For example:

(gdb) p system_memory->parent_obj->free
$2 = (ObjectFree *) 0x0

It plays perfect because the majority of QEMU device model is using MR as a
field (rather than a pointer) of another structure, so that's exactly what
we're looking for: we don't want to free() the MR as it's allocated
together with the owner device.  That'll be released when the owner free().

When dynamic allocation gets into the picture for MR, it's more complicated
for sure, because it means the user (like VFIOQuirk) will need to manually
allocate the MRs, then it requires explicit object_unparent() to detach
that from the device / owner when finalize().  NOTE!  object_unparent()
will NOT free the MR yet so far.  The MR still need to be manually freed
with an explicit g_free(), normally.  Again, I'd suggest you refer to the
VFIOQuirk code just as an example.  In that case this part is done with
e.g. vfio_bar_quirk_finalize().

        for (i = 0; i < quirk->nr_mem; i++) {
            object_unparent(OBJECT(&quirk->mem[i]));
        }
        g_free(quirk->mem);

Here quirk->mem is a pointer to an array of MR which can contain one or
more MRs, but the idea is the same.

AFAICT, the property list is exactly what you're saying.  IIUC normally an
object will be properly finalized()ed + free()ed when the parent object is
finalize()ed.  Here MR is just special as it bypasses all the free() part.

Agree.  However note again that in whatever case cross-device MR links will
still require explicit detachment or it's prone to memory leak.

I don't think it's too late. :)

IMHO if that statement is true, then QEMU will gradually become not
maintainable anymore with tons of such code nobody understands and nobody
can touch.  To me it can destine its death soon afterwards if so, sooner or
later.

OTOH, it'll be harder to justify or change indeed if some piece of code
stays longer in-tree.  So I agree with you even if we want to change
anything around this we should be with extreme cautions, and I don't think
we should merge anything like this too late of a release, just to give it
time to expose and break things.

Let's stick with this model; so far I still think this is the right thing
to do, and I'm happy to know that you seem to at least agree (irrelevant of
whether we should move on with a change).

IMHO we need to do this. Please recheck this after reading above on
finalize() v.s. free().  Here object_unparent() is needed because the MR is
allocated by the owner, it means only the owner knows how to free() it
(again: MR's own free()==NULL).  Then if we want to free it properly, we
need to detach it from the owner object first, hence object_unparent().

I think we can do that, or we don't.  It's the same as whether we want to
explicitly detach links for an embeded MR: if it's not explicitly done, we
can rely on the finalize() of the MR to do so.

In all cases, object_unparent() will still be needed because it will do
more things than memory_region_del_subregion(): it removes the property
link itself.

This is also one reason why I keep thinking what I suggested might be good:
it covers not only mr->subregions and also mr->container, it means the
detachment has no ordering constraints on which mr is finalize()ed first
(in this case, either the container mr or the child mr).

Let's see how you thinks after you read above first.  I hope we can get
more onto the same page at least on the context.

So far I still prefer using mr->refcount as less as possible.  Now it plays
the only role as "whether this MR is put onto an owner property list", and
for all the rest refcounts on MR it should always routes to the owner.  I
still think we need to be extremely cautious on further complicating this
refcount.  It's already complicated indeed, but hopefully this model is the
best we can trivially have right now, and so far it's clear to me, but it's
always possible I overlooked something.

Thanks,
