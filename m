We need to make sure it matches the hardware behaviour. Otherwise it
might break other operating systems. Looking at the history, we used
to break e1000 on various operating systems: windows, BSD, minix,
windriver ....

emulator so we need to make sure the function matches hardware
behaviour before it can be merged.

One way is to test via real hardware or involve Intel Engineers.
