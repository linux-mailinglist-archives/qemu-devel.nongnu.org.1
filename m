When you referred to "an object", do you mean the MR being finalized here?

IIUC when the MR reaches its finalize(), it should mean it's not live
anymore.

We have two forms of MR usages right now: either embeded in another Object
/ Device, or dynamically, like VFIOQuirk.

When used embeded, the MR is only finalized when being removed from the
object's property list, that should only happen when the object / device
triggered finalize().  Since the MR will use the owner->refcount so I
suppose it means the MR is not live anymore.

When used dynamically, object_unparent() is needed but that should only
happen when the object / owner is during finalize(), per document:

        If however the memory region is part of a dynamically allocated
        data structure, you should call object_unparent() to destroy the
        memory region before the data structure is freed.  For an example
        see VFIOMSIXInfo and VFIOQuirk in hw/vfio/pci.c.

Then the MR is also not live.

Yes, the MR will not vanish during finalize() of the owner object. However
I don't think it's "live"?  Again, it's based on my definition of
"liveness" as "taking one refcount of its owner", here the owner refcount
is zero.  IOW, I don't expect it to be accessible anywhere from any address
space (e.g. address_space_map()), because they'll all use
memory_region_ref() and that'll ultimately stops the owner from being
finalized.
