A lot of the current reliability issue is timeouts -- sometimes
our CI runners just run really slow (I have seen an example where
between a normal and a slow run on the same commit both the
compile and test times were 10x different...) So any test
that is not a fast-to-complete is much much more likely to
hit its timeout if the runner is running slowly. When I am
doing CI testing for merges "migration test timed out again"
is really really common.

We do not have infinite CI resources, unfortunately. Migration
is competing with everything else for time on CI. You have to
find a balance between "what do we run every time" and "what
do we only run when specifically testing a migration pullreq".
Similarly, there's a lot of iotests but we don't run all of them
for every block backend for every CI job via "make check".

Long test times for tests run under "make check" are also bad
for individual developers -- if I'm running "make check" to
test a target/arm change I've made I don't really want that
to then spend 15 minutes testing the migration code that
I haven't touched and that is vanishingly unlikely to be
affected by my patches.
