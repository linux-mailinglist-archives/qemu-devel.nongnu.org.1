We have sv64 defined in QEMU. Not sure if it's already a thing or not ....
it seems to me that ppl cares to sv57 mostly, so perhaps my sv64 worry
unjustified.

Just took a look in how we're validating satp for profiles and we're
allowing a higher satp mode than the profile mandates, issuing warnings
if the satp mode is set to a lower mode than the profile value.


So I guess the way we would like people to use rva23s64 with sv57 would be:

-cpu rva23s64,sv57=on

max CPU is using satp_mode = sv57. Since sv64 is mostly a placeholder then I
believe it's all good. Perhaps we could add a satp_mode_latest value for these
situations.
