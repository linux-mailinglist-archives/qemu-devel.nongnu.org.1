OK I get your point now.  However this doesn't look right, instead I start
to question why we need to send mr->addr at all..

As I said previously, AFAIU mr->addr should only be updated when there's
some PCI config space updates so that it moves the MR around in the address
space based on how guest drivers / BIOS (?) set things up.  Now after these
days not looking, and just started to look at this again, I think the only
sane place to do this update is during a post_load().

And if we start to check some of the memory_region_set_address() users,
that's exactly what happened..

  - ich9_pm_iospace_update(), update addr for ICH9LPCPMRegs.io, where
    ich9_pm_post_load() also invokes it.

  - pm_io_space_update(), updates PIIX4PMState.io, where
    vmstate_acpi_post_load() also invokes it.

I stopped here just looking at the initial two users, it looks all sane to
me that it only got updated there, because the update requires pci config
space being migrated first.

IOW, I don't think having mismatched mr->addr is wrong at this stage.
Instead, I don't see why we should send mr->addr at all in this case during
as early as SETUP, and I don't see anything justifies the mr->addr needs to
be verified in parse_ramblock() since ignore-shared introduced by Yury in
commit fbd162e629aaf8 in 2019.

We can't drop mr->addr now when it's on-wire, but I think we should drop
the error report and addr check, instead of this patch.

Thanks,
