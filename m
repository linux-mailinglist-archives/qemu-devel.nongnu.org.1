Just to confirm – this means we will have to do an allocation for each 
write request.  I think this should still be cheaper than the current 
memcpy(), but still wanted to ask back whether you agree.

(We could have a pool of buffers, but that would most definitely be a 
premature optimization – and I hope our memalloc algorithm can do that 
internally just fine.)
