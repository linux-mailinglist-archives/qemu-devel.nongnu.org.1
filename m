Thanks for sharing your insights.
I think there is definitely value in what you offer, and I'm trying to 
think how we could extend it in the future easily, without having 
another callback when a new event appear. In my experience on plugins, 
the least callbacks we have, and the simpler they are, the better it is.

Maybe we could have a single API like:

enum qemu_plugin_cf_event_type {
	QEMU_PLUGIN_CF_INTERRUPT;
	QEMU_PLUGIN_CF_TRAP;
	QEMU_PLUGIN_CF_SEMIHOSTING;
};

/* Sum type, a.k.a. "Rust-like" enum */
typedef struct {
     enum qemu_plugin_cf_event_type ev;
     union {
         data_for_interrupt interrupt;
         data_for_trap trap;
         data_for_semihosting semihosting;
} qemu_plugin_cf_event;
/* data_for_... could contain things like from/to addresses, interrupt 
id, ... */

...

void on_cf_event(qemu_plugin_cf_event ev)
{
	switch (ev.type) {
		case QEMU_PLUGIN_CF_TRAP:
			...
		case QEMU_PLUGIN_CF_SEMIHOSTING:
			...
		default:
			g_assert_not_reached();
	}
}

/* a plugin can register to one or several event - we could provide a 
QEMU_PLUGIN_CF_ALL for plugins tracking all events. */
qemu_plugin_register_cf_cb(QEMU_PLUGIN_CF_TRAP, &on_cf_event);
qemu_plugin_register_cf_cb(QEMU_PLUGIN_CF_SEMIHOSTING, &on_cf_event);

This way, a single callback can be registered for one or several events. 
And in the future, we are free to attach more data for every event, and 
add other events (TB_FALLTHROUGH, TB_JUMP, etc).

You're right, and the current cflow plugin is more a demonstration of 
using existing API than an efficient solution to this problem.
For cflow detection specifically, I think we can do better, by adding 
instrumentation right where we chain/jump between tb, and of course, 
tracking other events like you did in this series.
