On that point...

No new pure HMP commands please.  We consider implementation of the
QMP command to be the mandatory first step in any patch series. Any
HMP command must follow and must be implemented by calling the QMP
command handler.

The generic set/get design feels convenient because you don't
need to create new commands, but it has significant downsides
both for QEMU and the users of QEMU.

From a QEMU POV the main burden is that we loose understanding
of how users of QEMU are consuming our interface / functionality
at a conceptual level and at the low level. This in turns means
we either struggle to offer a stable API, or our hands are tied
behind our back for future changes.

Consumers of QEMU are similarly exposed to the raw low level
details which has many downsides

 * If QEMU ever changes impl, but retains the conceptual
   functionality, apps are broken.
 * If a given feature is more complex than a single property,
   apps will be invoking a whole set of commands to set many
   props to achieve a given task.
 * If certain sequences of prop changes are needed, apps
   have no guidance on the ordering dependancies - which
   might even change between QEMU versions
 * If setting one prop fails, apps may need to manually
   rollback previous prop changes they made
 * The schema is unable to describe what functionality is
   now available since device properties are invisible.
 * If two devices expose the same functionality, but via
   different properties, apps have inconsistent interfaces

I'm highly sceptical that exposing 'device_set' is a good
idea.

Note, querying whether a device supports a property is conceptually
quite different from querying whether QEMU supports a given operation,
because it requires apps to first connect the dots between the low
level property change, and the conceptual effect the want to produce.
