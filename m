Add CC Lukas.

From technical point, I agree Zhijian's comments. We can probably do
this gradually.
In my side, I know some local companies build thier HA/FT product based on =
COLO.
In this case, I think most of them already forked QEMU upstream code
to a private repo for internal mantained.
It may caused some upgrade issues in the future.

And another part is Lukas covered pacemaker project integrated COLO,
and I don't know users status for pacemaker.
Maybe Lukas can input some comments?

For the implementation, COLO not only have migration part of code(it
is the core of COLO), it also including network and block replication
for co-working.
If we remove migration related code need to consider how to handle
other parts, network maybe change to general QEMU netfilter?  block
replication ?

For the COLO framework unit test,  I think it need to add some "#if
defined(qtest)" in migration code for testing(COLO proxy/netfilter
already have independent qtest).

Chen
