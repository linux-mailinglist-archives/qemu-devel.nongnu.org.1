There were more problems with splitting the qemu_api crate related to
bindgen. Basically, you would want the system emulator bindings to
contain only those things that aren't already part of the common
bindings. But the system emulator headers will obviously include common
headers, too, so this becomes tricky.

If you don't do this, you get two bindings for the same type, but the
binding types won't be compatible with each other etc.

This approach of just building two separate libraries was a lot easier.
Apart from the obvious inefficiency, I just hate the need for
rust_dependency_map everywhere to make the library show up with the
neutral 'qemu_api' name in both cases. Maybe there is a better approach
where this could be defined for the library itself rather than for each
user, but I couldn't find one. meson is still black magic to me.
