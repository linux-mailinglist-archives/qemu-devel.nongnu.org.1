Reading this again, I think we're mixing two concepts here.

With this 6 year cut off, we're declaring the actual *removal* date,
not the deprecation date.

A deprecation is something that happens prior to removal normally,
to give people a warning of /future/ removal, as a suggestion
that they stop using it.

If we never set the 'deprecation_reason' on a machine type, then
unless someone reads this doc, they'll never realize they are on
a deprecated machine.

When it comes to machine types, I see deprecation as a way to tell
people they should not deploy a /new/ VM on a machine type, only
use it for back compat (incoming migration / restore from saved
image) with existing deployed VMs.

If we delete a machine on the 6 year anniversary, then users
don't want to be deploying /new/ VMs using that on the
5 year anniversary as it only gives a 1 year upgrade window.

So how long far back do we consider it reasonable for a user
to deploy a /new/ VM on an old machine type ? 1 year, 2 years,
3 years ?


How about picking the half way point ?  3 years ?

ie, set deprecation_reason for any machine that is 3 years
old, but declare that our deprecation cycle lasts for
3 years, instead of the normal 1 year, when applied to
machine types.

This would give a strong hint that users should get off the
old machine type, several years before its finally deleted.
