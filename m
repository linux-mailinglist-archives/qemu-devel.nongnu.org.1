The main reason for the SYSREG_ prefix was to make implementation of the
query interface easier; I'll see if we can implement it differently. (We
might want to think about how we handle it differently anyway.)

Did you forget to include [1]? :)

I agree that a lowercase conversion wouldn't make things too hard to
find in the docuementation.

For KVM, this works with -cpu max as well, as it falls through to -cpu
host implicitly. aarch64_host_initfn() is basically split into KVM and
HVF parts, so HVF will already do the right thing (i.e. not support it),
as will tcg (which uses a separate init function.)

The kernel making something writable, but we haven't updated
cpu-sysreg-properties.c via the script. As I'd expect regs/fields to be
added to sysreg much earlier than KVM making them writable, we'll
probably not see much of this warning in practice (only if you run a
really old QEMU version with a cutting-edge kernel.) This has mostly
triggered for me when I had messed up something while writing the code
:)

This is not user-input triggered, so maybe we should log it differently,
as the user can't really fix this themself?
