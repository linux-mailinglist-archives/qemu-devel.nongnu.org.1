There's also the `tracing` framework
https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/ that is quite nice for
defining tracing events **and** spans for logs. I find it confusing
that it still ties tracing events with log level filters though
(info/warn/error/debug/trace).

Perhaps this is also a good opportunity to restructure QEMU's logging
in general. As was said in other threads about tracing, most log items
are essentially traces, except guest_error, unimp and maybe I'm
missing a few others.

If we align QEMU's general logging to use log levels, we can convert
guest error logs to "Error" level logs of type: "guest", and unimp
logs to "Error" logs of type "unimplemented". Or, "Warn" instead of
"Error". Then, all trace_* items become straightforwardly Trace level
log items.

Then, all we have to do in the Rust side is implement a `tracing`
subscriber that consumes these traces and pushes them into QEMU's C
implementation.
