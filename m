We may do the following. But it's still confusing:

- If any of these cpu-pm features are available, we should not fail the
guest.  Meanwhile, users are not able to easily identify which features
are available and enabled, so that user may still get false assumptions.

- We may print out the capabilities that are enabled from
kvm_vm_enable_cap(), but seems this is not QEMU style.

- Since KVM commit 0abcc8f65cc ("KVM: VMX: enable X86_FEATURE_WAITPKG in
KVM capabilities"), WAITPKG is advertised to the guest by default, thus
it's not much meaningful to tight enable_cpu_pm with this feature.  But
before this logic is removed from QEMU, look at this case: WAITPKS is
available while none of KVM_X86_DISABLE_EXITS_xxx are available, we
don't fail the guest, but the behavior of the guest is exactly the same
with or without "cpu-pm=on".
