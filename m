What I'm saying is that you shouldn't have "TCG reset" and
"KVM reset" that are totally different code paths, but that the
reset function should be doing "reset the CPU", and then the
KVM codepath makes specific decisions about "for KVM these
particular things should be the kernel's reset settings" and
then passes that state over to the kernel.

The idea is that you only overwrite specific state where
you've decided "actually the kernel is the authoritative
source for what the reset state for these registers is".

The way this code path in Arm works is:
 * we reset all the QEMU-side CPU state struct in arm_cpu_reset_hold()
 * kvm_arm_reset_vcpu() calls kvm_arm_vcpu_init() which inits
   the KVM side vcpu
 * kvm_arm_reset_vcpu() calls the sequence write_kvmstate_to_list()
   followed by write_list_to_cpustate() which does "for the system
   registers specifically, read the values (and which registers we
   have) from KVM, and write them to the QEMU CPU state struct".
   We do this because on Arm we've said that the system registers
   in particular have the kernel as their authoritative source.
   (IIRC x86 makes QEMU the authority for its similar registers,
   so it has to do even less in its kvm_arch_reset_vcpu().)
 * the generic CPU core code will call kvm_arch_put_registers()
   before starting the vCPU, which copies whatever is in the QEMU-side
   CPU state struct into KVM

The upshot is that QEMU is the authority and arm_cpu_reset_hold()
defines the reset value for all CPU state by default. (For instance,
reset values for general purpose registers are set there.) But for
specific parts of the state where we want KVM to be the authority,
kvm_arm_reset_vcpu() gets to override that by filling in the CPU
state struct by asking the kernel what its values are.

What I'm trying to suggest here is that we don't want different
architectures to end up doing things differently. There are
multiple different design patterns that will work, but it will
be easier to work on QEMU if we can standardise on doing it
the same way across architectures.
