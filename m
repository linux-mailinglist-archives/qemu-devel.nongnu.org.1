I'm not convinced there's any need to introduce the new "channel header"
protocol messages. The multifd channels already have an initialization
message that is extensible to allow extra semantics to be indicated.
So if we want some of the multifd channels to be reserved for device
state, we could indicate that via some data in the MultiFDInit_t
message struct.

That said, the idea of reserving channels specifically for VFIO doesn't
make a whole lot of sense to me either.

Once we've done the RAM transfer, and are in the switchover phase
doing device state transfer, all the multifd channels are idle.
We should just use all those channels to transfer the device state,
in parallel.  Reserving channels just guarantees many idle channels
during RAM transfer, and further idle channels during vmstate
transfer.

IMHO it is more flexible to just use all available multifd channel
resources all the time. Again the 'MultiFDPacket_t' struct has
both 'flags' and unused fields, so it is extensible to indicate
that is it being used for new types of data.


With regards,
Daniel
