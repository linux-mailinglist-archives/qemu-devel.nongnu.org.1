This is not getting installed in enough scenarios IMHO.

My current workflow is commonly

  $ ./configure --target-list=x86_64-softmmu
  $ make
  $ ./scripts/qmp/qmp-shell-wrap 
   /var/home/berrange/src/virt/qemu/build
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "/var/home/berrange/src/virt/qemu/scripts/qmp/qmp-shell-wrap", line 7, in <module>
      from qemu.qmp import qmp_shell
  ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qemu.qmp'

Even if I add in a call to 'source build/pyvenv/bin/activate'
after 'make', I'm still missing the qemu.qmp python module.

AFAICT, qemu.qmp only gets installed in the venv if you run
'make check', and IMHO that should not be expected for the
above usage scenario.

Likewise I can no longer run any of the test programs directly
without first having run 'make check'. eg what I would currently
do is:

   $ ./configure --target-list=x86_64-softmmu
   $ make
   $ cd build/tests/qemu-iotests
   $ ./check 300

I don't generally run 'make check' as frequently as I
'configure && make' as it adds alot of time which is
not needed usually.

In general I find it tedious having to remember to run
'source build/pyvenv/bin/activate' in every terminal
window where I might want to run a QEMU script that relies
on python. It is also fairly undesirable too, as I use the
same terminal window for various purposes, that activating
the QEMU venv can interfere with non-QEMU python usage.

I would find it helpful if we provided a "run" script in the
root dir of the build directory that contained the following

  $ cat build/run
  #!/bin/sh

  set -e

  HERE=$(realpath $(dirname $0))
  source $HERE/pyvenv/bin/activate
  exec "$@"

Which would be used as a wrapper to execute scripts with the
right environment. That would let us keep the simpler workflow,
and avoid polluting the global terminal environment with the
qemu venv.

eg to be used as

   $ ./configure --target-list=x86_64-softmmu
   $ make
   $ cd build/tests/qemu-iotests
   $ ../../run ./check 300

or

  $ ./configure --target-list=x86_64-softmmu
  $ make
  $ ./build/run ./scripts/qmp/qmp-shell-wrap
