It's not about typing but reading it. The verbose struct definitions are 
hard to follow and makes board code look more complex than it should be.

I tend to get such requests to clean up unrelated things whenever I try to 
change anything in PPC Mac emulation which I also complain about and think 
is not reasonable to ask. But I did not ask for unrelated cleanup here and 
changing the patch so you don't do this:

-DEFINE_MACHINE("none", machine_none_machine_init)
+static const TypeInfo null_machine_types[] = {
+    {
+        .name           = MACHINE_TYPE_NAME("none"),
+        .parent         = TYPE_MACHINE,
+        .class_init     = null_machine_class_init,
+    },
+};
+
+DEFINE_TYPES(null_machine_types)

but instead add the .interfaces field to a variant of DEFINE_MACHINE once 
and keep the one line definition is not something unreasonable to ask. I 
think you can ask your friends to not make a mess in the shared house 
while having a party or at least clean up after that. Adding one more 
parameter to the macro is also simple to do so I don't get why you're so 
opposed to this.
