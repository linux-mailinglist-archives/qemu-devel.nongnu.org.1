Manos,

I understand your desire to make fast progress, at the same time I can't
stress enough the importance of building on a shared design. Each
architectural decision we make now - whether about trait hierarchies, macro
designs, or API patterns - will significantly impact future maintenance and
development work.

The suggestions about how to split the implementation into smaller patches
aim to facilitate smaller and easier discussions about specific aspects,
and they are only examples and in no way the only possible solution.
However, with respect to design choices I think I pointed out major issues
that can't be treated simply as wanting to "do everything at once".
Dismissing design discussions as mere disagreements about style, or
responding confrontationally that you will address "bits that are wrong and
not much else" won't help us move forward. Code reviews, especially for
core APIs, necessarily include discussion of design choices and language
usage.

This isn't the first time our technical discussions have become tense, and
we're talking past each other at this point. My suggestion is that you try
to explain your point of view to a third person, that can help you
understand the patch review process and what is requested of both code
contributors and reviewers.

Thanks,

Paolo
