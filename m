I don't really like this because it perpetuates a state where we have
parallel implementations of devices that have to be kept in sync.

If we're re-writing C devices in Rust, we need to be able to promptly
drop the C impl once the Rust impl is feature complete. Keeping 2 impls
is a general maint burden, as well as an ongoing vmstate compatibility
danger if a change in one impl is not matched by an identical change
in the other impl.

IMHO having Rust declared supported in QEMU should be aligned with being
able to drop C impls of any ported devices.

With regards,
Daniel
