For these profiles we would block them from running into RV64I because it's not
the right base ISA. We should add a RV64E CPU for them.

Same thing with any 32 bit profiles that we might add in the future - rva22u64
isn't compatible with any 32 bits ATM.

It doesn't, because it's an user problem. We're wasting too much time trying to
sandbag weird command lines. "-cpu rv64,rva22u64=false" is a nonsense command
line that will give a nonsense CPU.

A failsafe solution I see for it is to forbid profile support for rv64. But this
is too extreme because "-cpu rv64,rva22u64=true" is a valid use, and a way more
common use, that would be cropped out because we want to babysit a minority of
users doing nonsense.

IMO we should let users use profiles with any capable CPU and document properly
what it means to do stuff like "-cpu rv64,rva22u64=false".

And now that I thought more about it, there's no gain for the 'max' CPU to support
profiles (all extensions enabled by default) but -cpu max,rva22u64=false will still
be possible. I guess I'll remove profile support for 'max' CPU.

We can make aliases. '-cpu rva22u64' would be an alias for '-cpu rv64i,rva22u64=true'.
Same thing with every other profile we end up adding.
