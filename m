Yes, that's unfortunate, but we don't duplicate other QAPI enums because
of it.

Treating DRY as dogma would be foolish.

It's not just the duplication, it's also the conversion between the two
enums.

> However, I think it's a problem to compare strings to find this, when it can be set at compile time, in a file that will have to stay target specific anyway.

Converting from string to enum at first practical opportunity makes the
code simpler more often than not.
