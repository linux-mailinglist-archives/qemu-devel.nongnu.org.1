Yes, I share the same concern.  I think migration decided to go already
with as much thread model as possible that it can.

And I paused that attempt to move load() into a thread, as of now, finding
it's still non-trivial to work out the major issue: after dest load became
a thread, it means it can't take BQL for too long otherwise it blocks the
monitor.

It means we can't take bql for _any_ IO operation because it can stuck at
any IO waiting for the iochannel / NIC, aka, any qemu_get*() API invoked.

Meanwhile we still trivially need the bql from time to time, either in
pre_load() / post_load(), or some of VMStateInfo->get().  But still I can't
blindly take them, as in any VMStateInfo->get(), it can invoke qemu_get*()
itself.

So I am not sure whether what we can get from that is worthwhile yet on the
effort to make it work..

It'll face the same challenge here on whether we can join() in the main
thread.  IOW, job-cancel can take time which can also potentially block
qemu from quitting fast.
