In terms of closed source projects, effectively they don't exist from a
QEMU maintainer's POV. Our deprecation & removal policy is designed so
that we don't need to think about who is using stuff.

When QEMU deprecates something, any users (whether open source or closed
source) have 2 releases in which to notice this, and make a request that
we cancel the deprecation, or change their code.

Libvirt is special in the sense that we'll CC libvirt mailing list on
changes to the deprecated.rst file, and we'll often not propose
deprecations in the first place if we know libvirt is using it, since
we can ask libvirt quite easily & libvirt people pay attention to QEMU.

With regards,
Daniel
