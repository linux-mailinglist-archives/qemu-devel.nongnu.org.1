It's the 30th, sorry if this is late but I just saw it today.  +Alistair 
and Daniel, as I didn't sync up with anyone about this so not sure if 
someone else is looking already (we're not internally).

I'm not 100% sure this is a sane GSoC idea, as it's a bit open ended and 
might have some tricky parts.  That said it's tripping some people up 
and as far as I know nobody's started looking at it, so I figrued I'd 
write something up.

I can try and dig up some more links if folks thing it's interesting, 
IIRC there's been a handful of bug reports related to very small loops 
that run ~10x slower when vectorized.  Large benchmarks like SPEC have 
also shown slowdowns.

=== RISC-V Vector TCG Frontend Optimization ===

'''Summary:''' The RISC-V vector extension has been implemented in QEMU, 
but we have some performance pathologies mapping it to existing TCG 
backends.  This project would aim to improve the performance of the 
RISC-V vector ISA's mappings to TCG.

The RISC-V TCG frontend (ie, decoding RISC-V instructions 
and emitting TCG calls to emulate them) has some inefficient mappings to 
TCG, which results in binaries that have vector instructions frequently 
performing worse than those without, sometimes even up to 10x slower.  
This causes various headaches for users, including running toolchain 
regressions and doing distro work.  This project's aim would be to bring 
the performance of vectorized RISC-V code to a similar level as the 
corresponding scalar code.

This will definitely require changing the RISC-V TCG frontend.  It's 
likely there is some remaining optimization work that can be done 
without adding TCG primitives, but it may be necessary to do some core 
TCG work in order to improve performance sufficiently.
