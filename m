This is configured in the .rst file, not in code. I just happened to use a
different level in my test document.

For initial merge, I'll probably enable the new generator on QMP only while
I work on namespace support.

Yep, it will come along with the inliner later.

Always happy to take HTML/CSS patches from someone with a strong opinion.
For now, though, ...

Easy to change!

Yeah, inliner is all or nothing.

I have a patch for this in my kvm forum branch, along with "convert
everything into actual cross-references". Will send afterwards.

Yes, but I did figure out why and I do have a solution planned now. It's
something I had to work around for "The members of..." pointers.
