Ah, I understand. Conditional just make sense if you don't support "partial success", and you want to delete target image in case of failure. And create a new one, to restart incremental job.

But anyway, this all could be simply achieved with bitmap-copying/merging API, if we allow to pass user-given bitmap to the mirror as working bitmap.

Good. It's a golden rule: never make public interfaces which you don't actually need for production. I myself sometimes violate it and spend extra time on developing features, which we later have to just drop as "not needed downstream, no sense in upstreaming".
