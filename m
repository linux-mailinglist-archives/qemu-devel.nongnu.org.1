virtqueue_fill is called first with elem2. So vq->used_elems[2 %
vq->num] is filled with the needed information of the descriptor:
index, len and ndescs. idx function parameter is ignored.

Optionally, virtqueue_push is called. It checks if
vq->used_elems[vq->used_idx] is valid. valid can be elem->in_num +
elem->out_num > 0, and reset them on every used ring write. If it is
not valid, this is a no-op. Currently, it is not valid.

Same process for elem1.

virtqueue_fill is the same for elem0. But now virtqueue_flush gets
interesting, as it detects vq->used_elems[0] is used. It scans for the
first not-used element, and it finds it is vq->used_elems[3]. So it
needs to write an used elem with id =3D 2 and the corresponding length.

Maybe it is interesting to implement ways to improve the look for the
last used descriptor, but if any I'd go for a bitmap and always on top
of the basis series.

The algorithm has not been tested, so maybe I've missed something.
