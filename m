So basically a user's guide.

That's something I plan to write after the code is ready.

Hmm, this patch set does not bring ability to use multiple VFs
in a single VM - that ability is already in QEMU even without this
patch set.

As Yanghang has measured the downtime improvement happens even
with a single VF, although with more VFs one can additionality see
the scalability benefits of this patch set.

The biggest advantage is obviously the downtime performance.

I'm not sure if there are any obvious disadvantages (assuming
the setup supports the multifd migration in the first place),
besides maybe slightly bigger memory usage for in-flight buffers?

But we have an option for capping that if someone is concerned
about it.

I've added descriptions of these 3 new migration handlers to
docs/devel/migration/vfio.rst.

They are also described in struct SaveVMHandlers in include/migration/register.h
and also in the commit messages that introduce them.

> new threads,

A total of two of these, their function is described in docs/devel/migration/vfio.rst
and also in the commit messages that introduce them.

I think you meant "new data type for multifd channel" here but that's
in migration core, not VFIO.

I can certainly include all these in the new version cover letter if that's
easier for a new reader.

Looking at the source file for this page at docs/devel/migration/features.rst
the "multifd" section should appear on this page automatically after
I added it to docs/devel/migration/vfio.rst.

If we are to drop/skip adding the "x-migration-load-config-after-iter"
option for now then let's do it now so the next version could be already
tested in its target shape.

After this "x-migration-load-config-after-iter" option is proposed
once again in QEMU 10.1 cycle then it obviously will be forward ported
to whatever the code looks at that point and tested again.

The patch itself is not going to suddenly disappear :) - it's on the
mailing list and in my repository here:
https://gitlab.com/maciejsszmigiero/qemu/-/commit/6582ac5ac338c40ad74ec60820e85b06c4509a2a
