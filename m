Fair.  The sane way to avoid that is keeping constructors super-simple.
Ideally, not call anything.  Next best, not call anything but simple
initialization functions from well-known system libraries, and our own
portability wrappers for them.

Oh yes.  So much simpler, easier, and safer than constructors.

More evidence for us abusing constructors.

The constructor audit I'd like to see: dumb them down to super-simple, ...

... so nobody will need to put debug prints there.

I suggest to record our low opinion on constructor abuse in the commit
message.  As is, it almost sounds as if we considered it normal.
Starting threads there definitely isn't!
