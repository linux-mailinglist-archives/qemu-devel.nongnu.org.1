Thread that never landed in my mailbox actually and it is quite

Yes this was introduced for security reasons. In a nutshell, the idea is
to *not* follow symlinks in any element of the path being opened. It thus
naturally starts at the export root for which we have an fd.

>=20

Can you elaborate on the "things being move on host side" ? With
an example of code that breaks on the client side ?

Correct.

>=20

The problem is how to have the guest know about such changes, e.g. in
order to invalidate a stale cache entry. 9P doesn't provide any way for
host->client notification.
