No; but the version of this series as sent also does not add "The members
of ..." stubs, which would be a regression. I didn't necessarily intend for
this to be merged as-is; more of a "part one, with additional tricky
elements that require more careful thought isolated into separate patches
for later".

where "later" means "in v2" or "as a follow-up series as we stage things in
a development branch before final submission for inclusion to
origin/master" or whatever the actual mechanism is. I don't have a strong
vision there, really; I just wanted to nail down the basics out in the open
even if that was just between you (Markus) and I and we have a gentleman's
agreement that it looks tentatively OK.

What I've named things like allow-oob that aren't features, but ought to be
documented. We may well decide to promote them to real-deal special
features, or maybe not. My work-in-progress branch currently just adds
"dummy" features to document them. We can discuss this later alongside the
patch that implements this.

&gt;<br>
&gt; Hi!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; This series is a very, very barebones implementation for the new QAPI<=
br>
&gt; doc generator. It does not have many features that I presented on at K=
VM<br>
&gt; Forum; the point of this patch set is instead to present a stripped do=
wn<br>
&gt; basis for ongoing work so we can discuss on-list with full context of<=
br>
&gt; the code available to do so.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The documentation this series generates is *not suitable* for replacin=
g<br>
&gt; the current document generator, it has a few glaring omissions - on<br=
>
&gt; purpose - those features have been factored out intentionally so they<=
br>
&gt; can be reviewed with fuller context and more careful review.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; What this series does:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; - Adds the new &quot;Transmogrifier&quot; rST generator to qapidoc.py,=
 which<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0generates an in-memory rST document using qapi-domain dire=
ctives.<br>
&gt; - Adds a test document that showcases this new transmogrifier.<br>
<br>
Note to other reviewers: transmogrifier output is<br>
docs/manual/qapi/index.html.<br>
<br>
&gt; What this series very notably does not do (yet):<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; - &quot;ifcond&quot; data for anything other than top-level entities i=
s not<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0considered or rendered. This means &quot;if&quot; statemen=
ts for features and<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0members are entirely absent.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; - The inliner is not present at all. This series renders only<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0documentation exactly as it is exists in the source files.=
