This seems true, and I also remember something when I looked at this
previously but maybe nobody tried to fix it.  ARM seems to be correct on
that field, otoh.

Is it possible we fix KVM on x86?

kvm_handle_error_pfn() has the fault context, so IIUC it should be able to
figure that out too like what ARM does (with get_vma_page_shift()).

What is the major benefit of reporting in QEMU's stderr in this case?

For example, how should we consume the error reports that this patch
introduces?  Is it still for debugging purpose?

I agree it's always better to dump something in QEMU when such happened,
but IIUC what I mentioned above (by monitoring QEMU ramblock setups, and
monitor host dmesg on any vaddr reported hwpoison) should also allow anyone
to deduce the page size of affected vaddr, especially if it's for debugging
purpose.  However I could possibly have missed the goal here..

Yes IMHO it'll always be helpful to separate it if possible.
