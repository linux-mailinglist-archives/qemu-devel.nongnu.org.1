MemoryRegions used to "piggyback" on their owners instead of using their
own reference counters due to the circular dependencies between them,
which caused a few problems. Stop piggybacking, showing that the
circular dependencies are actually broken.

Problems with piggybacking
==========================

Piggybacking obscured the fact that a MemoryRegion used memory allocated
to its owner, as it didn't take a reference to the owner.

It also created another circular reference when an owner referred to its
MemoryRegion via memory_region_ref(). This could happen in two
scenarios:

- A subregion and its container had the same owner. In this case, the
  container would use memory_region_ref() to take a reference to the
  subregion.

- An owner called address_space_map() with a guest-controlled address
  that points back to its MemoryRegion. This scenario is similar to what
  MemReentrancyGuard handles.

Avoiding such a circular reference required checking if the referrer is
the owner, complicating the code further.

Insight
=======

This change challenges the underlying assumption that circulare
dependencies exist and can be tolerated. The deletable MemoryRegions are
of hotpluggable devices. A device and its MemoryRegion have the
following dependencies:

QOM tree -> Device
Container -> MemoryRegion
Device <-> MemoryRegion

Techniques like piggybacking or a hypothetical garbage collector can
finalize the device and the MemoryRegion once the QOM tree and container
lose their dependencies. However, these methods are fundamentally
insufficient because the MemoryRegion and the device have finalizers,
and they do not respect the dependencies these objects may have during
finalization.

As long as the object model based on the device and the MemoryRegion is
correct, one of them should lose its dependency on the first,
establishing a valid finalization order. Understanding this allows using
standard reference counting, which is immune to the problems of
piggybacking.

Analysis reveals that the device no longer depends on the
MemoryRegion after unrealization. The device needs the MemoryRegion to
add it to a container and expose it to an AddressSpace. Once unrealized,
the device is hidden from the AddresSpaces and thus no longer needs the
MemoryRegion.

This suggests that the circular dependencies are broken and that the
device should be finalized *after*:

- It is unrealized.
- The MemoryRegion is finalized.

Solution
========

Fortunately, this requirement can be coded with minimal complexity.
Hotpluggable devices already explicitly call
memory_region_del_subregion() to stop accepting new accesses to its
MemoryRegions after unrealization. This change lets object_unparent()
calls follow that, permitting the MemoryRegions to be finalized earlier
than the device.

This enforces a valid finalization order, allows MemoryRegions to rely
on standard reference counting, and eliminates the entire class of
memory leaks caused by piggybacking.
