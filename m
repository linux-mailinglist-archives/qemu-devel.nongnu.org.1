All my suggestions here aren't recommendation, but rather thinking out loud
to see if we can find a crorrect way to deal with the issue.

The part I don't fancy doing on QEMU part is read_ack write intercept.

benefit would be that we won't have to maintain state on QEMU side
and then migrate it.

Ack for that but,
that would need someone from hw/firmware side since error status block
handling is done by firmware.=20

right now we are just making things up based on spec interpretation.
