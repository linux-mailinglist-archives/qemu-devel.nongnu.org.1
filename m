So as far as my understanding, we provide these binaries using Qemu command
as depicted in the example you provided and there is no way I found to put
them into a single image.
Regarding the overlapping space, I don't have much idea but I think we
could provide a starting address separately to these images something like
addr=3D0x00100000.

So as per your suggestion, I compared my images and I found that the image
does not show a virtual disk, and other commands like mkdir, do not have
these binaries.
So these binaries are not included at the time of image creation and I
don't exactly know that how can we add these binaries into the QNX image.

The Image that is currently installed in real hardware does not have a
debugging symbol, so I can't use GDB  to debug that.
Now I am looking for a way to create the correct QNX OS image for Qemu.

Any lead in this regard will be really helpful :)


BR!
