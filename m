No, U-Boot replaces the in memory copy with the default, the NVRAM is only 
changed if saveenv command is issued. I don't want to 100% emulate U-Boot 
but make it easier for users, see below.

I hope that part of the cover letter would end up in the QEMU changelog so 
it will be in QEMU docs. The amigang.rst doc specifically documents how to 
run Linux on these machines and these patches don't affect Linux nor work 
with it so I left them out to not confuse readers with options they don't 
need.

What was in upstream U-Boot wasn't what was in the binary that came with 
the machine. The binary has these defaults and AmigaOS depends on it, it 
does not work with edge as found for the pegasos2 where the default was 
edge and that resulted in missed IRQs.

It would not be simpler because I'd need another variable to keep how much 
of the NVRAM to rewrite. Note that the area to write in the two blk_pwrite 
calls are different. We have 3 cases:

1. User just created an empty NVRAM file to allow persisting settings in 
it for future runs. Something has to put defaults there but if not running 
with -bios firmware.bin because using -kernel to boot instead, it would 
stay empty. Also firmware.bin has defaults that does not autoboot so needs 
manual intervention and disable UDMA so it will be slow. In this case we 
init NVRAM with sensible defaults which is done in the first if. (This is 
also used when no NVRAM file is provided.)

2. The NVRAM has some values in it either because the user supplied their 
preferred values or edited previous content directly and not within the 
guest. To make their life easier and allow them to leave checksum empty I 
allow setting crc to 0 in which case it will just update the crc and use 
the contents. This is handled in the second if.

3. There is content in NVRAM with a crc. In this case only the crc is 
checked and nothing is replaced. This is done in the third if and will 
never fail in one of the first two cases but checks NVRAM in the third 
case. When checksum does not match U-Boot would use defaults for the 
memory copy used only while U-Boot is running but unless user issues 
saveenv it still passes wrong NVRAM contents to the guest so without 
U-Boot we get the same behaviour here.
