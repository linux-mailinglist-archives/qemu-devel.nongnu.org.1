As I understand that doc it says that the driver should not apply the 
gamma values immediately but store it in the driver and apply it only on 
the subsequent SetEntries call so it does not change the current palette 
but only takes effect when the palette changes the next time. For indexed 
colors when there is a palette this could be done in the driver so it 
calculates the corrected palette on SetEntries and send that to QEMU not 
the color values it gets from the guest. For that it needs to remember the 
gamma table from the SetGamma call preceeding SetEntries which can be 
stored in an array in the driver. For direct color modes this does not 
work because then the values in the frame buffer need to be gamma 
corrected. This is what the qfb device seems to do. So I think you could 
support gamma for indexed (256 colors) in QEMU VGA driver but for modes 
with more colors you may need qfb or similar device because VGA does not 
support gamma. You could theoretically do it in the driver in a shadow 
frame buffer but that does not seem to be the best way and might be slow 
doing it in the guest.

These would end up in qemu/hw/display/vga.c::vga_ioport_write() cases 
PEL_IW and PEL_D and set the palette in the VGA card (you can see these 
with -trace enable="vga_*") but I think that's only used for indexed modes 
and you could gamma correct these values in the driver as said above 
without changes in QEMU. Direct color modes use the VBE_DISPI interface 
(this comes from Bochs and probably documented somewhere there) and linear 
frame buffer. In this case gamma correction should be done by whatever 
writes the frame buffer (I don't know if MacOS has support for that in 
software for gfx cards that don't do it, maybe if there is then that could 
be used) or whatever reads it when displaying which is what qfb does which 
is like a gfx chip that supports gamma. (I think ATI chips support gamma 
but QEMU emulation uses VGA DISPI interface too so it's not emulated. 
There could be two ways to implement that, either add gamma support for 
vga which may get some resistance if most real chips don't do that but 
could be considered and submit an RFC patch as this might be useful for 
other devices too, or ati-vga may need to use it's own gfx_update routine 
when not in VGA mode which may eventually be needed but to keep it simple 
I'm using the VGA facilites for now.)

Look at the corresponding QEMU device which is here:
https://github.com/SolraBizna/qemu/commit/f551de525360a26df481c5b80876845c323d9303
I think these would be handled in qfb_ctrl_write().

No it says it needs patched QEMU that adds the qfb device. I think what it 
means is that this qfb device can be present with macfb and allows both to 
be used but unpatched QEMU only has macfb and not the qfb this driver 
wants to talk to.
