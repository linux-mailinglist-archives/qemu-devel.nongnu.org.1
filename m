Aha.  More at the end of my reply.

Steinbach's Guideline for Systems Programming: Never test for an error
condition you don't know how to handle.

This old quip is a funny way to say that errors we don't know how to
handle are *bad*, and should be avoided.

You assure us this can't happen today.  Because of that, broken error
recovery is not an actual problem.

However, if things change some day so it can happen, broken error
recovery becomes an actual problem.

so, broken error recovery just "for future use" is actually just for
silent future breakage.

But is it broken?  This is what I'm trying to find out with my "what
happens if" question.

If it is broken, then passing &error_abort would likely be less bad:
crash instead of silent breakage.  Also makes it completely obvious in
the code that these errors are not handled, whereas broken error
handling looks like it is until you actually think about it.
