Just to clarify again, the asserts are still there when compiled with 
--enable-debug. The patch only turns them off for optimised release builds 
which I think makes sense if these asserts are to catch programming 
errors. I think I've also suggested adding noassert versions of these but 
that wasn't a popular idea and it may also not be easy to convert all 
places to use that like for example the register fields related usage in 
target/ppc as that would also affect other places. So this seems to be the 
simplest and most effective approach.

The softfloat related usage in these tests I've done seem to mostly come 
from unpacking and repacking floats in softfloat which is done for every 
operation, e.g. muladd which mp3 encoding mostly uses does 3 unpacks and 1 
pack for each call and each unpack is 3 extracts so even small overheads 
add app quickly. Just 1 muladd will result in 9 extracts and 2 deposits at 
least plus updating PPC flags for each FPU op adds a bunch more. I did 
some profiling with perf to find these.
