It depends what you are trying to achieve. The tradeoffs for guest
placement on small systems still pretty much apply on large systems
too. There may be factors which alter the balance for the tradeoffs,
but the theme is still determined by what the guest owner requires
and what the host owner wants to achieve.

Strict host:guest CPU affinity will give the guest a deterministic
amount of host CPU time, and lowest latencies. It is wasteful of
host resources though, because if a guest CPU is idle, a different
guests' CPU can't use that host CPU time. So letting guests run
freely across host cores and overcommiting CPUs will maximize
utilization but give non-deterministic timeslices & latency to
guests.


With regards,
Daniel
