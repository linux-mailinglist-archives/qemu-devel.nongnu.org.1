There is a difference between max and other CPUs. For max as has already
been stated migration is likely to break anyway between QEMU versions -
we should also make that clear in the docs. But for the other CPUs we
need to honour the existing defaults.

This is why we have compatibility logic so its easy to do the right
thing by specifying the QEMU version in the machine type.=20

We can't assume its not. We even have explicit tests that check
migration doesn't break between master and $PREVSTABLE.

If the user asks for a specific CPU model (not a special case like max)
we should provide the most accurate model that we can as explicitly set
by the user. We don't trade accuracy for speed (c.f. discussions about
floating point and INEXACT detection).
