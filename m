Thanks for clarification. I think the point I mentioned below still 
holds; virglrenderer does not have any code that can be skipped for 
MTLTexture with the absence of VIRGL_RENDERER_NATIVE_SHARE_TEXTURE.

It depends on changes.

I intend to upstream the Cocoa change and the following virlgrenderer 
changes once the libepoxy change to enable ANGLE is merged, which is 
blocking forever... They are useless without the libepoxy change:
https://github.com/akihikodaki/virglrenderer/commit/6dfbc7e61a72347485c09a171c8c6c0908e12a2a
https://github.com/akihikodaki/virglrenderer/commit/b12bda2fd272b0ffd0a9b95a021e4a13e947749b

I intend to upstream all two changes for ANGLE:
https://github.com/akihikodaki/angle/commits/v/

The other changes are already submitted to the upstream if I don't miss 
anything.

Akihiko Odaki
