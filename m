I've run into problems in the past around updating config space registers
because when we migrate from a prepatch QEMU instance to a post patch 1 the
config space registers are compared. I'm not sure if LNKCAP is included
in that.  LNKSTA is explicitly ruled out I think.

For examples see all the machine version checks in
hw/core/machine.c

The one that bit me was fixed with x-pcie-err-unc-mask
when I was fixing a register that didn't match the spec defined values.

I've implemented control but this still ends up over engineered because
the reason I want to control this is to vary access parameters for calculating
latency and bandwidth.  That is easiest done by controlling the EP status
to degrade the link.  For that I just set the CAP register on the switch DSP
to allow suitably high values and let pcie_sync_bridge() match this to
the status of the EP (which I have properties to contro).
There seems to be only one way 'negotiation' of these parameters so it
needs to be EP driven.
