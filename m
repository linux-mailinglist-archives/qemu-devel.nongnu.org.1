Hey everyone, just bumping this series since I suspect it got lost. It 
should be fairly straightforward to get this in: patches 1 and 3 were 
already approved here, and 2 and 4 only have small changes since v1 to 
account for feedback.

Let me know if anything else is needed on my end---and happy new year!
