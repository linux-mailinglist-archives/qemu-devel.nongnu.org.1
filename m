I suppose this section of the email was really to just point out that
what constitutions a "multi-headed", "logical", and "multi-logical"
device is rather confusing from just reading the spec.  Since writing
this, i've kind of settled on:

MH-* - anything with multiple heads, regardless of how it works
SLD - one LD per head, but LD does not imply any particular command set
MLD - multiple LD's per head, but those LD's may only attach to one head
DCD - anything can technically be a DCD if it implements the commands

Trying to figure out, from the spec, "what commands an MH-SLD" should
implement to be "Spec Compliance" was my frustration.  It's somewhat
clear now that the answer is "Technically nothing... unless its an MLD".

The ambiguous part is... what commands relate specifically to an SLD?
The spec isn't really written that way, and the answer is that an SLD is
more of a lack of other functionality (specifically MLD functionality),
rather than its own set of functionality.

i.e. an SLD does not require an FM-Owned LD for management, but an MHD,
MLD, and DCD all do (at least in theory).

I can say that the earliest forms of MH-SLD, and certainly pre-DCD, is
likely to present all memory on all ports, and potentially provide some
custom commands to help hosts enforce exclusivity.

It's beyond the spec, but this can actually be emulated today with the
MH-SLD setup I describe below.  Certainly I expected a yuk factor to
proposing it, but I think the reality is on the path to 3.0 and DCD
devices we should at least entertain that someone will probably do this
with real hardware.

I actually think it's a good step to go from MH-SLD to MH-SLD+DCD while
not having to worry about the complexity of MLD and switches.

(I have not gotten the chance to review the DCD patch set yet, it's on
my list for after ISC'23, I presume this is what has been done).

My thoughts would be that you would have something like the following:

-device ct3d,... etc etc
-device cxl-dcd,type3-backend=mem0,manager=true

the manager would be the owner of the FM-Owned LD, and therefore the
system responsible for managing requests for memory.

How we pass those messages between instances is then an exercise for the
reader.


What I have been doing is just creating a shared memory region with
mkipc and using a separate program to initiate that shared state before
launching the guests.  I'll talk about this a little further down.

I concur, and it's what i was looking into next.

I think your other notes on MH-* with switches is really where I was
left scratching my head.

When I look at Switch/MLD functionality vs DCD, I have a gut feeling the
vast majority of early device vendors are going to skip right over
switches and MLD setups and go directly to MH-SLD+DCD.

To late :].  It was useful as a learning exercise, but it's definitely
not upstream quality.  I may post it for the sake of the playground, but
I too would recommend against this method of pooling in the long term.

I made a proto-DCD command set that was reachable from each memdev
character device, and exposed it to every qemu instance as part of ct3d
(I'm still learning the QEMU ecosystem, so was easier to bodge it in
than make a new device and link it up).

Then I created a shared memory region with mkipc, and implemented a
simple mutex in the space, as well as all the record keeping needed to
manage sections/extents.

The last step was a few extra lines in the read/write functions to
ensure accesses to "Valid addresses" that "Aren't allocated" produce
errors.

At this point, each guest is capable basically using the device to do
the coordination for you by simply calling the allocate/deallocate
functions.

And that's it, you've got pooling.  Each guest sees the full extent of
the entire device, but must ask the device for access to a given
section, and the section can be translated into a memory block number
under the given numa node.


Ok, now lets talk about why this is a bad and why you shouldn't do it
this way:

* Technically a number of bios/hardware interleave functionality can
  bite you pretty hard when making the assumption that memory blocks are
  physically contiguous hardware addresses. However, that assumption
  holds if you simply don't turn those options on, so it might be useful
  as an early-adopter platform.


* The security posutre of a device like this is bad.  It requires each
  attached host to clear the memory before releasing it.  There isn't
  really a good way to do this in numa-mode, so you would have to
  implement custom firmware commands to ensure it happens, and that
  means custom drivers blah blah blah - not great.

  Basically you're trusting each host to play nice.  Not great.
  But potentially useful for early adopters regardless.


* General compaitibility and being in-spec - this design requires a
  number of non-spec extensions, so just generally not recommended,
  certainly not here in QEMU.

I've hummed and hawwed over external process vs another QEMU instance and I
still haven't come to a satisfying answer here.  It feels extremely
heavy-handed to use an entirely separate QEMU instance just for this,
but there's nothing to say you can't just host it in one of the
head-attached instances.

I basically skipped this and allowed each instance to send the command
themselves, but serialized it with a mutex.  That way each instance can
operate cleanly without directly coordinating with each other.  I could
see a vendor implementing it this way on early devices.

I don't have a good answer for this yet, but maybe once I review the DCD
patch set I'll have more opinions.

I originally went this route, but the downside of this is "What happens
when the main dies and has to restart".  There's all of kinds of
badness associated with that.  It's why i moved the shared state into a
separately created mkipc region.

Personally I think we should focus on the DCD model.  In fact, I think
we're already very close to this, as my personal prototype showed this
can work fairly cleanly, and I imagine I'll have a quick MHD patch set
once I get the change to review the DCD patch set.

If I'm being the honest, the more I look at the LD model, the less I
like it, but I understand that's how scale is going to be achieved.  I
don't know if focusing on that design right now is going to produce
adoption in the short term, since we're not likely to see those devices
for a few years.

MH-SLD+DCD is likely to show up much sooner, so I will target that.
