If Libvirt is looking for some suggested value to set a parameter, it
should just leave it empty, using the default provided by QEMU?  I was
expecting Libvirt to only specify anything it explicitly knows the answer.

I agree migration is special cased.. I also agree if we design the
interface today it may not be like that.  I suppose it means it's only the
"API cleaness" issue.  That matches my understanding, even if I wished I
missed something else..

That'll be a hassle for all mgmt for sure whenever an old libvirt might
still have a chance to run on a newer QEMU.

That'll also be a hassle for any downstream if some Y+1 branch starts to
drop the global-set way completely then downstream might need to take care
of keeping that instead for the major release until the last Y, otherwise
if someone installs some X.Y+1 package on X.Y it might break similarly.
All that for "let's make the interface look better".

I sincerely could be wrong, but I keep my skeptical view of this whole
effort; it's only about after this series (while this series still makes
sense to me to have caps being able to set as params, and the "config" in
general).  I would say we could at least prioritize and invest other more
important things, for example on handshakes, which could provide functional
differences (removing src/dst param dependency, removing hackish channel
establishments all over the places, early failure of device state mismatch
rather than late failure on converge, etc.).

Thanks,
