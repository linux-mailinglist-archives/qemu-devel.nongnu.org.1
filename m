 From the DT consumer point of view, the interpretation and assumptions 
around coherency *are* generally architecture- or platform-specific. For 
instance on RISC-V, many platforms want to assume coherency by default 
(and potentially use "dma-noncoherent" to mark individual devices that 
aren't), while others may still want to do the opposite and use 
"dma-coherent" in the same manner as Arm and AArch64. Neither property 
existed back in ePAPR, so typical PowerPC systems wouldn't even be 
looking and will just make their own assumptions by other means.

Thanks,
Robin.
