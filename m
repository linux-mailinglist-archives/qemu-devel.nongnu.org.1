Heya qemu developers,

We at Software Freedom Conservancy have been hearing from member
projects that people are asking whether they can submit code to these
projects that was generated by large language models (LLMs), sometimes
called AI coding assistants.  We'd like to better understand the nature
of these requests, how much LLM-generated code has been offered to these
projects, and generally how you're feeling about the situation.

To do this, we will be holding three different sessions, where you are
welcome to join and share your thoughts and any details so far on these
types of contributions.  The sessions will all be run in the same way
with the same topic - we are running three in order to hopefully allow
as many people from around the world to attend as possible.

Our Director of Compliance, Denver Gingerich, will be hosting some sessions
at the times below for all our member projects to discuss the issue.

date -d "2024-10-29 20:00 UTC"
date -d "2024-11-01 14:00 UTC"
date -d "2024-11-06 04:00 UTC"

We'll be meeting in this room for the sessions:

  https://bbb.sfconservancy.org/b/oss-nnj-obi-jea

We are excited to see some of you there and are looking forward to
drafting appropriate recommendations based on what we hear!

Thanks,
-Pono at Software Freedom Conservancy
