Right now, the system reset is concluded by a call to
cpu_synchronize_all_post_reset() in order to sync any changes
that the machine reset callback applied to the CPU state.

However, for VMs with encrypted state such as SEV-ES guests (currently
the only case of guests with non-resettable CPUs) this cannot be done,
because guest state has already been finalized by machine-init-done notifiers.
cpu_synchronize_all_post_reset() does nothing on these guests, and actually
we would like to make it fail if called once guest has been encrypted.
So, assume that boards that support non-resettable CPUs do not touch
CPU state and that all such setup is done before, at the time of
cpu_synchronize_all_post_init().
