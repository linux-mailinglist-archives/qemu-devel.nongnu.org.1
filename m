+Firmware
+========
+
+Migration migrates the copies of RAM and ROM, and thus when running
+on the destination it includes the firmware from the source. Even after
+resetting a VM, the old firmware is used.  Only once QEMU has been restarted
+is the new firmware in use.
+
+- Changes in firmware size can cause changes in the required RAMBlock size
+  to hold the firmware and thus migration can fail.  In practice it's best
+  to pad firmware images to convenient powers of 2 with plenty of space
+  for growth.
+
+- Care should be taken with device emulation code so that newer
+  emulation code can work with older firmware to allow forward migration.
+
+- Care should be taken with newer firmware so that backward migration
+  to older systems with older device emulation code will work.
+
+In some cases it may be best to tie specific firmware versions to specific
+versioned machine types to cut down on the combinations that will need
+support.  This is also useful when newer versions of firmware outgrow
+the padding.
