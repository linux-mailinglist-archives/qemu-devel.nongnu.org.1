Oh, right, that's a good point.

Right, that's the case for _F_VRING_ASID, which is simple and easy to 
deal with. Though I think this is an edge case across all vendor 
devices, as most likely only those no-chip IOMMU parents may support it. 
It's a luxury for normal device to steal another VF for this ASID feature...

So instead of a direct lookup from HVA to IOVA, the purpose of the extra 
reverse lookup from HVA to GPA is to verify the validity of GPA (avoid 
from being mistakenly picked from the overlapped region)? But this would 
seem require scanning the entire GPA space to identify possible GPA 
ranges that are potentially overlapped? I wonder if there exists 
possibility to simplify this assumption, could we go this extra layer of 
GPA wide scan and validation, *only* when overlap is indeed detected 
during memory listerner's region_add (say during which we try to insert 
a duplicate / overlapped HVA into the HVA -> IOVA tree)? Or simply put, 
the first match on the reverse lookup would mostly suffice, since we 
know virtio driver can't use guest memory from these overlapped regions? 
You may say this assumption is too bold, but do we have other means to 
guarantee the first match will always hit under SVQ lookup? Given that 
we don't receive an instance of issue report until we move the memory 
listener registration upfront to device initialization, I guess there 
should be some point or under certain condition that the non-overlapped 
1:1 translation and lookup can be satisfied. Don't you agree?
