Yeah, I did something similar with commit 562a7d23bf ("vhost: mask 
VIRTIO_F_RING_RESET for vhost and vhost-user devices") so I think for 
now is the right approach.

I suggest to check also other devices like we did in that commit (e.g.  
hw/scsi/vhost-scsi.c, hw/scsi/vhost-user-scsi.c, etc. )

Yes, I think we should fix the documentation, and after a few years of 
not looking at it I'm confused again about what it does.

But re-reading my commit for VIRTIO_F_RING_RESET, it seems that I had 
interpreted `feature_bits` (2nd argument) as a list of features that 
QEMU doesn't know how to emulate and therefore are required by the 
backend (vhost/vhost-user/vdpa). Because the problem is that `features` 
(3rd argument) is a set of features required by the driver that can be 
provided by both QEMU and the backend.

VIRTIO_F_RING_RESET is just above the line added by this patch.

Yeah, I agree on this!

Maybe we should discuss it in another thread, but I agree that we should 
fix it in someway. Thank you for raising this discussion!

This patch LGTM, but as I mention we should fix other devices as well,
but maybe we can do with the common macro you suggested in another 
patch.
