I'm a bit confused by the range, I'd rather expect a list of tuples,
e.g. <midr>:<revidr>,<midr>:<revidr>, ...

Isn't revidr a 64 bit value?

I'm mostly wondering about conflicting values between "we make MIDR et
al. writable, so we have a value different from what the host sees" and
"we provide a list of possible values to the guest, so it can prepare
for running on those hosts". Do we want to be able to provide a common
set to the guest, and then enlighten it with the list of systems that it
actually *might* run on? A benefit would be that it could always observe
the same (configured) register entries, regardless where it runs (needs
more plumbing in QEMU, I think.) We'd also need to be clear about what
we'd require (i.e. do we expect that both the real host values and the
configured values are present in the list?)

Not sure if the machine level is the right place to configure this, or
if it needs to go to the cpu options. While it is a machine-wide
configuration, it also means that we configure some cpu features in two
different places (even if they serve a different purpose.)

We could also choose to not expose properties for MIDR and friends at
all, even if they are writable.
