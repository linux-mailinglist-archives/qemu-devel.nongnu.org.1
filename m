My preference is that the Go code has nicely formatted sections,
like the qmp-example one. The decision to not work on this now
was made together with Markus as he pointed out this formatting
on documentation part is still a work in progress, besides the
fact that it can be done as a follow-up.

Having examples is a nice thing even if the format is not great.

Well, I'm happy to hear it. How the repo get created so we can
move the discussion and patches there?

Sure.

Looking forward to it.
