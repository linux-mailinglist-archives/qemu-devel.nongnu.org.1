I understand the temptation!  Unfortunately, the "legal questions and
risks" Daniel described apply to *any* kind of copyrightable material,
not just to code.

Quote:

    To satisfy the DCO, the patch contributor has to fully understand the
    copyright and license status of code they are contributing to QEMU. Wit=
h AI
    code generators, the copyright and license status of the output is ill-=
defined
    with no generally accepted, settled legal foundation.

    Where the training material is known, it is common for it to include la=
rge
    volumes of material under restrictive licensing/copyright terms. Even w=
here
    the training material is all known to be under open source licenses, it=
 is
    likely to be under a variety of terms, not all of which will be compati=
ble
    with QEMU's licensing requirements.

    How contributors could comply with DCO terms (b) or (c) for the output =
of AI
    code generators commonly available today is unclear.  The QEMU project =
is not
    willing or able to accept the legal risks of non-compliance.
