I think it's about the expectation of whether we should already received
that sem post.  My understanding is in most cases we should directly return
and avoid such wait.

Per my previous experience, 1ms is not a major issue to be added on top of
downtime in corner cases like this.

We do have a lot of othre potential optimizations to reduce downtime, or I
should say in the other way, that..  there can be a lot of cases where we
can hit much larger downtime than expected. Consider when we don't even
account downtime for device states for now, either load_state or
save_state, we only count RAM but that's far from accurate.. and we do have
more chances to optimize.  Some are listed here, but some may not:

https://wiki.qemu.org/ToDo/LiveMigration#Optimizations

If you agree with my above "expectation" statement, I'd say we should avoid
using a busy loop whenever possible in QEMU unless extremely necessary.

Oops, I forgot that even if I was aware..

Please do so if you can do this.  Thank you, Wei!  (I hope you can switch
some working hours later on!)

Let me know if that doesn't work; it'll be all fine.

Thanks,
