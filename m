If it was broken, IMHO we should just fix it and backport to stable.

I think Juan used to worry on what happens if someone already used an old
version of old release, e.g., someone using 8.2.0 may not be able to
migrate to 8.2.1 if we fix that breakage in 9.0 and backport that to 8.2.1.
My take is that maybe that's overcomplicated, and maybe we should simply
only maintain the latest stable version, rather than all.  In this case,
IMHO it will be less burden if we only guarantee 8.2.1 will be working,
e.g., when migrating from 8.1.z -> 8.2.1.  Then we should just state a
known issue in 8.2.0 that it is broken, and both:

  (1) 8.1.z -> 8.2.0, and
  (2) 8.2.0 -> 8.2.1

will expect to fail.

I don't think we can guarantee no bug there, but indeed we can do better on
providing some test framework for device VMSDs.

I added one more todo:

How's that look?  Feel free to modify on your will.
