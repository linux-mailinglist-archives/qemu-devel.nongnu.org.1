Well, remember that with CPR there's a live migration going on and a brief
pause; so it's always a fun question about what happens with clocks; however
with CPR I guess there's a better chance of it being solvable than general
live migration.

It's debian's 6.12.12 as the guest, and    git describe b50db7095
v5.16-rc2-5-gb50db7095fe0

so I'd say yes, should have that patch.

It's an AMD single socket desktop (3950X) [with 6.14.2 kernel]
