oops, I should have said it's Tier 2 with hosts for amd64, Tier 2 w/o hosts
and
tier 3 for aarch64 (and everything else). In FreeBSD, amd64 and aarch64 are
tier 1 supported platforms and I got those confused. It is an important
difference
and later in my email I refer to it, so I thought a correction was in order=
.
