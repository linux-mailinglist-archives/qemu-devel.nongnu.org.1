Yes, you can see it here as well:

Not that I know of. There has been a pretty big discussion about the 
uAPI back then when it was introduced, but not something formal.
However, I don't think having a few GBs of device data is the common 
case for VFIO devices, I just pointed out the extreme cases.

I am not sure this would be feasible, as it will involve major changes 
to the uAPI and for the devices.
But if that's something you wish to explore I can ask around and see if 
it's a hard no go.

Interesting, do you know how much time migrating these vCPUs take?

I understand your concern, and I hope as well we can work together 
towards a proper and maintainable solution.
Even if we don't get VFIO to use the multifd framework directly, maybe 
adding common APIs would be good enough.
For example, take this series of adding a common API to create migration 
channels.
I also saw you and Fabiano have been talking about a thread-pool model 
to replace the multifd threads. Maybe we can use such scheme also for 
VFIO and even for the vCPUs case you mentioned above, each component 
stating how many threads it needs and creating a big pool for all 
migration clients.
