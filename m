I changed my mind after talking with Michael in this thread:

https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2023-09/msg02567.html


There are differences in how gcc and clang (and probably other toolchains) behave
when choosing to crop code gated with 'if (kvm_enabled && something)'. It is
better to have stubs for all KVM functions to avoid relying on compiler behavior.

We should keep the stubs in this patch as is. Thanks,


Daniel
