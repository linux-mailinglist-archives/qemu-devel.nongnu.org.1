Is that an alternative to commenting out page_aligned = true? (Previously 
it also needed some tweak on when to set DMA bit but after your fix in 
commit 5df50b8e973 in master resolved it that's no longer needed. Now only 
the interrupt control reset values and commenting page_aligned = true was 
needed to get it work.)

I've tested the firmware image available from this page:
http://eliyahu.org/tabor/setup.html
There's also a technical manual there that has info on the content of the 
SD card image.

There are two U-Boot binaries on the card for some reason (I think maybe 
the first one runs from cache as RAM and sets up the memory controller), 
then the first one loads some env variables and then the second U-Boot 
which then loads the bootloader. If you change one byte in the environment 
on the SD card it breaks the checksum and then it does not load the 
bootloader but gives a prompt. You can then look around in U-Boot. 
Alternatively you can extract the U-Boot binaries and convert to elf to 
load it with -bios then you can skip the SD card. Maybe depending on some 
env settings I haven't identified yet, the bootloader either says no 
bootable devices found or crashes when calling back into U-Boot which may 
be something similar that I had to fix for sam460ex here: 
https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/u-boot-sam460ex/-/commit/f6402c160f781145206b2dc0eb4d50738d0531d4/ 
but I don't have the Tabor U-Boot sources yet to check. Presumably it 
works on real machine so maybe it checks for SATA or other devices which 
aren't emulated so it may get an unexpected NULL value. I've tried adding 
dummy SATA emulation that shows an empty bus but it did not fix that. It 
could also be something completely different. With the USB patch, it at 
least finds USB storage devices after usb start in U-Boot but that's all I 
could test. I should find some Linux boot media known to work on real 
machine to test further but haven't had time for it.

These existing machines set up values in PPCE500MachineClass in their init 
methods that the e500.c uses to change its behaviour to match the machine 
so to continue adding another board in the classic way I'd continue like 
that. I've added another similar board file like those machines setting 
the values matching P1022. For the additional devices in e500.c I've just 
patched them in for experimenting but these could be optionally created 
based on new values in the MachineClass, like has_2nd_i2c or similar to 
not change existing machines. I would not go into more elaborate solutions 
if your fdt based machine creation replaces this eventually.

I think the e500 machine was originally made for running with KVM and not 
for TCG emulation but it fell out of maintenance for a while and maybe 
Linux dropped some of the support by now so don't know if that still 
works. But it seems to still work for booting Linux in emulation so that 
should definitely be kept working.

This is new addition from today. I still don't get why you need sparse-mem 
when you also have a separate patch for l2cache regs which could have a 
memory region itself for this but for now I'm OK with adding this region 
from the tabor board code on my branch for experimenting. I'm a long way 
from this to work or being mergeable so your RFC might be ready and merged 
before that and then I don't need most of my changes, so I try to keep 
them minimal and have no intent trying to clean up the existing machines 
or SoC emulation.

Yes, the CHIPIDEA maybe is a better idea. I've only picked one that had 
the regs at the right place for a start and it seemed to work enough. But 
you likely have a more complete implementation so if you submit that 
eventually this will also be resolved for me so I can drop the above 
change and use yours instead. I just added it above because you seem to 
not have BIT(2) but I don't remember what that was and if it's really 
needed. Otherwise it looked you have the same.
