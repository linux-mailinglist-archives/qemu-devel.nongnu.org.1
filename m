I think I see what you meant.  Ignoring -global is ok.  I agree with you
that should be pure debugging, and feel free to keep it like that if you
can't find anything to persist it - it may not justify your time spent if
it grows too much.

The important part is still "atomicity".  Consider right after Libvirt
sends a "migrate" command someone quickly cancelled it and invoked another
one using another "config".  Yes there will still be events generated to
Libvirt but I think that'll be asynchronous anyway so its arrival might
have been after the other one migrating VM again.

Attach to that to "returns" provides atomicity making sure if Libvirt
invoking a "migrate" command and get the returns, if that succeeded Libvirt
knows the returned setup is 100% the one that is running now.  It might be
cancelled too but the finalized setup will match what Libvirt triggers.

Said that, not that I think any of such would ever happen.. but that idea
does match with atomicity provided by QMP "migrate" with "config".

Let's not bother; I'm totally OK ignoring -global.  When one's testing
manually, one won't be using "config" in "migrate" normally so it's fine.

Agree.  Maybe we could still keep the interface for more than two releases.
Maybe we don't need to rush removing the support, and keep it deprecate for
long enough, until we figure out when it's safe.

CPR is still live migration, I hope we can reach consensus.  It uses
exactly the caps/params it needs, but it's migrating the same as live
migration would do, except it migrates some more fds.

It could be more special if it was based on fork(), there're tons of
uncertainties over fork() with a multi-threaded app, but now we're going
scm rights, much better I'd say. Same reason, it is still live migration
when it's using generic unix sockets.

savevm - we don't plan to yet support any migration cap/param on it, right?

I remember the other use case for enabling mapped-ram, but per my memory
there is much better way to go for that use case rather than building it on
top of savevm, so I'd still think savevm doesn't need any extension, and it
should take zero parameters even in the near future.

What it can do is reset all parameters right before start, then "recover"
the parameters right after, taking BQL for the whole process.  Logically if
we know it's a new libvirt we don't even need to bother on the "recover"
part, but we may still want to consider the old libvirts too as long as
there's compat concerns.

Yep.  For this one keeping it as-is is simpler.  We can wait for Dan/Markus
and others to chime in when there's other opinions.

Adding caps into it is all fine; I don't see anything would break.

Yes, this is discussed above as well.  The worst case is we can keep the
deprecation for as long as how we deprecate machine types.  Logically
that was defined partly as "max major release cycle on guaranteed ABI",
then we may assume whatever to be rebased on the current release in any
downstream would have new libvirt ready.  Again, we can discuss this later,
marking deprecation can be done first.
