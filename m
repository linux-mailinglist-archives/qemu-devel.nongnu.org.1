This depends on MemoryRegionOps binding. I will see how much HPET can do,
and I'm sorry for not being able to review the remaining patches yet in
this week, especially the last two. I will continue next week (my machine
will be powered down until next Monday :( ).

I found vmstate_array_of_pointer_to_struct missed a `info` field, and I
could submit a patch to fix this nit next week (along with other cleanup
you and other miantainers suggested for HPET).

I'd also like to try apply zeroable to VMStateField to avoid missing any
items...

This makes sense.

I also like this idea!

Thanks,
