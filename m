The helper checks old v.s. new contexts, where here we want to pass in the
current context.  Would that be a no-op then?

In this specific case it should try to yield to the port listener that is
waiting for the preempt channel, aka, socket_accept_incoming_migration(),
and ultimately it'll kick off this sem, by:

 socket_accept_incoming_migration ->
  migration_ioc_process_incoming  ->
    postcopy_preempt_new_channel

Not a problem at all, please shoot if there's any questions either here or
elsewhere. You're going to maintain it anyway as part of the migration code
base. :-D
