Ok, so the issue is that the recv side would previously be stuck at the
sync semaphore and multifd_recv_terminate_threads() would kick it only
after 'exiting' was set, so no further recv() would happen.

After the patch, there's no final sync anymore, so the recv thread loops
around and waits at the recv() until multifd_send_terminate_threads()
closes the connection.

Waiting on sem_sync as before would lead to a cleaner termination
process IMO, but I don't think it's worth the extra complexity of
introducing a sync to the device state migration.

So I think we'll have to go with one of the approaches suggested on this
thread (gnutls_bye or premature_ok). I'm fine either way, but let's make
sure we add a reference to the patch above and some words explaining the
situation.

(let me know if anyone prefers the gnutls_bye approach I have implemented
and I can send a proper series)
