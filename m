We definitely need cancel.  It was always used in precopy, and people use
it a lot!

That's exactly why we should fail it with a proper error message, IMHO.
Because the user may not really understand the impact of postcopy.

I remember I also tried to reuse migrate-cancel to work as what
migrate-pause does currently (so as to not introduce yet another new QMP
command).  I don't remember why we came up with the new cmd, but with
migrate-pause being there, I think the only sane way to respond to cancel
request during postcopy is to fail it properly..

We had "cancel" first, then "yank".  I didn't remember who merged yank,
especially for migration, and why it was ever needed.

What I still remember is yank crash qemu migration quite frequently, though
I can't blame it as it does help us to find quite a few mismatch on
iochannel setup/cleanup or stuff like that.  So it's sometimes "helpful" as
kind of a program checker..

Migration users should have stick with "cancel" rather than "yank" - qmp
"yank" would "FAIL" the migration instead of showing CANCELLED, definitely
should avoid.  I am not aware of anybody that uses "yank" for migration at
all.

So yeah, both commands are slightly duplicated, and if we want to throw
one, it needs to be yank, not cancel.  I'm fine keeping both..

When postcopy==true (even if multifd==true as well!  Or not, it doesn't
matter), we should reject the cancel request, IMHO.
