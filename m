We already have plugins that have similar per architecture knowledge (contrib/plugins/howvec.c) and it's ok in some specific cases.

I was not thinking about a new interface for this. Having the "raw" 
interrupt id is enough for a plugin to do useful things, by having 
knowledge of which architecture it's instrumenting.

You're right, but it's because it's querying instruction data.
I may be wrong on that, but at translation time, we may or may not be 
interested in accessing tb/insn data.

However, for control flow analysis, beyond a simple counting plugin, we 
probably want to access further data almost everytime.

I see it closer from syscall instrumentation, which pushes the syscall 
id, and all register values, instead of letting the user poke it. Makes 
more sense compared to that?

To the opposite of interrupt id, a PC is something universal by 
definition, and with a single meaning across architecture. However, 
accessing it by name varies per architecture, and even per sub events, 
as you are stating for RISC-V.

It's a good compromise for now, and avoid introducing a more complex 
data type.

My goal was not to hijack this series, or put the burden on you, but to 
talk about which direction we want to go.
As long as we start with a single callback (vs one per event), I'm fine 
to go slowly and iterate in the future.

Thanks Julian!
