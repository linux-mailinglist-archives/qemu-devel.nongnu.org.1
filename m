Right. But, in short:

1. I'm not sure, that such granularity is necessary.

2. It may implemented later, on top of the feature.

Right, here in v3: https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2025-09/msg01644.html

Still at this point, I also needed local-incoming=true target option, so I
considered all the parameters like "I can't make feature without extra
per-device options, so here they are".

A day later, after motivating comment from Markus (accidentally in v2),
I found and suggested the way:

https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2025-09/msg01960.html

And further versions v4-v7 were the realization of the idea. Still, main
benefit is possibility to get rid of per-device local-incoming=true
options for target, not about a kind of per-device "capability" flag we
discuss now.

A, and here I said [1]:

And then, went this way, postponing realization of per-device options..

And then, developing similar migration for vhost-user-blk, found
that I can't use on boolean capability for such features, the reason
in commit message, which we discuss now.

Than, current design came in v5 (v4 was skipped).. And I even got an
approval from Fabiano :)

Yes, right.

I missed, that, "postponing (probably forever)" per-device options
realization, I started to implement another way to solve the same
problem (switching from one boolean capability to a backend-transfer
list).

In other words, if at some point implement per-device options, that will
partly intersect by functionality with current complex migration
parameter..

-

But still, I think, that parameter backend-transfer = [list of targets]
is better than per-device option. With per-device options we'll have to
care about them forever. I can't imagine a way to make them TRUE by
default.

Using machine type, to set option to TRUE by default in new MT, and to
false in all previous ones doesn't make real sense: we never migrate on
another MT, but we do can migrate from QEMU without support for
virtio-net backend transfer to the QEMU with such support. And on target
QEMU we'll want to enable virtio-net backend-transfer for further
migrations..

So, I think, modifying machine types is wrong idea here. So, we have to
keep new options FALSE by default, and management tool have to care to
set them appropriately.

-

Let's look from the POV of management tool.

With complex parameter (list of backend-transfer targets, suggested with
this series), what should we do?

1. With introspection, get backend-transfer targets supported by source
    and target QEMUs
2. Get and intersection, assume X
3. Set same backend-transfer=X on source and target
4. Start a migration

But with per-device parameters it becomes a lot more complicated and
error prone

1. Somehow understand (how?), which devices support backend-transfer on
    source and target
2. Get an intersection
3. Set all the backend-transfer options on both vms correspondingly,
    doing personal qom-set for each device
4. Start a migration

-

In short:

1. per device - is too high granularity, making management more complex

2. per feature - is what we need. And it's a normal use for migration
capabilities: we implement a new migration feature, and add new
capability. The only new bit with this series is that "we are going to"
implement similar capabilities later, and seems good to organize them
all into a list, rather than make separate booleans.

Understand. But I can't imagine how to keep management simple with per-device
options..

What do you think?
