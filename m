Sorry for late...just return from vacation.

EMM, it seems 10.0.x (x < 4) can't migrate to 10.0.y (4 <= y <= 5),
right? If so, could we treat this behavior as a regression?

I think so. in this series, Paolo added compat options in pc_compat_10_0
so it should be picked to stable v10.1.

IIUC, if we picked current compat options to stable v10.1, then stable
v10.1 requires previous v10.0 sets the pdcm & arch-cap bits (i.e., do
not apply the fixes or revert the previous fix).

So it seems the reverts are unavoidable on v10.0?

(Let's see what Paolo and the other maintainers think.)

This issue is indeed quite tricky. Sometimes people (including myself)
assume that backporting fixes to the stable branch can avoid adding a
compat option. Now it seems the compat option is the better choice, as
users need to ensure migration rather than downtime before upgrading to
the stable version :-(.

Thanks,
