Isn't migration_incoming_state_setup() almost immediately invoked (after
migration_transport_compatible() check passed), which will start to make
the retval of migration_is_running() reflecting the fact?

IMHO as long as QMP handlers are run with any lock (currently, BQL), then
such layout should keep working?  That will make sure QMP "migrate" and
"migrate_set_parameters" be serialized, that's, AFAICT, what we only need.

If we'll introduce FAILING, then plus CANCELLING I think we should cover
all race against migration_cleanup()?  As long as we'll have both FAILING
and CANCELLING to return true for migration_is_running().

Yes, we'll need to make sure when new states introduced it needs to report
correctly in migration_is_running().  I think it's not an issue because we
need to do it right with/without relying on the function to ban updates on
caps/params.. It always must be done right as migration_is_running() is
also used in other use cases.

I need to confess I'm still a bit lost on what it is about, and what is the
problem we're solving here.. But I can always wait and read the patches
when they come up.. :)
