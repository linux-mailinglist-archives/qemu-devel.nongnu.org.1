520 * 16 * 63 is 524160 sectors, 128 less than the 524288 reported.  I
figure that's harmless.  Only ancient software should look at CHS, and
losing a few sectors with ancient software is fine.

The partition table's EndLBA is 1032191 even though the disk has only
524288 cylinders.  Scary!

Its EndCHS is consistent with its EndLBA: 1024*16*63 =3D 1032191 + 1.

Have you tried with a host folder containing more than 256MiB?  What
happens if you try to read all of it?

I'm not sure this mismatch causes the problem.  I suspect the bogus
EndLBA does.

Suppressing MBR initialization avoids the partially bogus partition
table.

But if we create a partition table, it better make sense, don't you
think?

This one:

    Some limitations remains, the size parameter is recognized only when
    "format=3Dvvfat" is passed. In particular, "format=3Draw,size=3Dxxx" is
    keeping the previously hardcoded value: 504MB for FAT16 and 32 MB for
    FAT12. FAT32 has not been adjusted and thus still default to 504MB.

EndLBA matches disk size.  EndCHS still matches EndLBA.  Good.

The difference to the command line you showed above is format=3Draw (bad)
vs. format=3Dvvfat (good).

With format=3Draw,size=3D256M you get that size, but a bogus partition
table.

With format=3Dvvfat,size=3D256M you get that size, and a sensible partition
table.

Correct?
