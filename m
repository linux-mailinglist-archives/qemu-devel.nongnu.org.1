As commented offline, maybe one would want the option to enable the 
alternative mode, where such updates (in the SHM region) are not sent to 
vhost-user devices. In such a configuration, the MEM_READ / MEM_WRITE 
would be unavoidable.

What comes to mind are vhost-user devices with limited number of 
supported memslots.

No idea how relevant that really is, and how many SHM regions we will 
see in practice.

I recently increased the number of supported memslots for rust-vmm and 
libvhost-user, but not sure about other devices (in particular, dpdk, 
spdk, and whether we really care about that here).
