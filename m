Something like the following will not work properly with ARI-capable 
device (think of a as an ARI-capable device):
-device a,addr=0x1.0x0,multifunction=on -device a,addr=0x1.0x1

This is because the next function numbers advertised with ARI are not 
updated with the multifunction configuration, but they are hardcoded in 
the device implementation. In this sense, the traditional (non-SR/IOV) 
multifunction mechanism QEMU has will not work with ARI-capable devices.
