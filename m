Actually from a dev point of view I am not sure it changes much to have
either ARM spec rev baseline or CPU ref core named model.

One remark is that if you look at
https://developer.arm.com/documentation/109697/2024_09?lang=en
you will see there are quite a lot of spec revisions and quite a few of
them are actually meaningful in the light of currently avaiable and
relevant HW we want to address. What I would like to avoid is to be
obliged to look at all of them in a generic manner while we just want to
address few cpu ref models.

Also starting from the ARM spec rev baseline the end-user may need to
add more feature opt-ins to be close to a specific cpu model. So I
foresee extra complexity for the end-user.

But again I from a dev pov it shouldn't change much and we should end up
with a proto that illustrates the working model
