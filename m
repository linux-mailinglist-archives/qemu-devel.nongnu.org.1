The R2D+ board uses a SH7751 SoC, which memory controller can access
7 external banks. This board has its boot flash on CS#0, a FPGA on CS#1,
64MB of SDRAM on CS#3, a SM501 display on CS#4 and some ISA bus on CS#5;
leaving CS#2, and CS#6 available. CS#2 can have SDRAM, while CS#6 only
SRAM (not really a difference in emulation).

 From QEMU side, we could fill these empty slots with 2*64MB of RAM, so
the machine could use up to 192MB. But then it is up to the guest to
use it.

Looking at Linux i.e. it seems to hardcode the RAM base/size in
arch/sh/include/asm/page.h, so we'd need changes there to use more
memory, which seems unlikely to get for a such old board...
