I'm not sure even if so.

VFIO's current use case is pretty special - it still has a host pointer,
it's just that things like memcpy() might not be always suitable to be
applied on MMIO mapped regions.  Alex explained the rational in commit
4a2e242bbb3.  I mean, the host pointer is valid even if ram_device=true in
this case.  Even if no direct access allowed (memcpy, etc.) it still
operates on the host address using ram_device_mem_ops.

Yes, and when there is a mapped host address and someone tries to access an
address that is bound to a private page, QEMU should get a SIGBUS.  This
code is not ready yet for gmem, but I believe it'll work like that when
in-place gmem folio conversions will be ready.  So far QEMU's gmem works by
providing two layers of memory backends, which is IMHO pretty tricky.

Definitely not suggesting to install an invalid pointer anywhere.  The
mapped pointer will still be valid for gmem for example, but the fault
isn't.  We need to differenciate two things (1) virtual address mapping,
then (2) permission and accesses on the folios / pages of the mapping.
Here I think it's okay if the host pointer is correctly mapped.

For your private MMIO use case, my question is if there's no host pointer
to be mapped anyway, then what's the benefit to make the MR to be ram=on?
Can we simply make it a normal IO memory region?  The only benefit of a
ram=on MR is, IMHO, being able to be accessed as RAM-like.  If there's no
host pointer at all, I don't yet understand how that helps private MMIO
from working.

Thanks,
