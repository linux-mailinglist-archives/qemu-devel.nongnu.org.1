Yes, for lookup to succeed it should be fully qualified, though if the
target text is "ns:module", that's actually going to succeed here, too.

If lookup fails, we actually continue on to #2, but whether or not this
does anything useful depends on whether or not the original target text was
fully qualified or not. If it was, #2 searches with the exact same text and
will fail again and proceed to #3, where because we had a fully qualified
name, none of the search conditions apply and we then just exit.

(It just lacks an early return, but abstractly, if lookup on #1 fails with
a fully qualified name, we are indeed done.)

If lookup fails because it wasn't actually fully qualified, then #2 has
some gaps to try to fill.

we tried #1 and failed, then we tried #2 and failed again.

I think it gets charged to a module named "qapi-schema". Silly, but it
doesn't really break anything.

I should point out that:

- #3 and #4 are mutually exclusive
- #5 and #6 are mutually exclusive
- #3/#4 and #5/#6 are mutually exclusive
- Only one of #3/#4/#5/#6 will happen for a given reference.
- If we choose #5 or #6, #7 may also happen. If we choose #3 or #4, #7 will
never happen.

I bet I can make the code here cleaner by combining some of these, it's
just a lot of context on the input to keep in mind while designing the
conditionals, so I wrote it out very "explicitly" to help myself make sense
of it ...

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; This patch does three things:<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 1. Record the current namespace context in =
pending_xrefs so it can be<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 used for link resolution later=
,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 2. Pass that recorded namespace context to =
find_obj() when resolving a<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 reference, and<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 3. Wildly and completely rewrite find_obj()=
.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cross-reference support is expanded to tole=
rate the presence or absence<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of either namespace or module, and to cope =
with the presence or absence<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of contextual information for either.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; References now work like this:<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 1. If the explicit reference target is reco=
rded in the domain&#39;s object<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 registry, we link to that targ=
et and stop looking. We do this lookup<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 regardless of how fully qualif=
ied the target is, which allows direct<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 references to modules (which d=
on&#39;t have a module component to their<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 names) or direct references to=
 definitions that may or may not belong<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 to a namespace or module.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 2. If contextual information is available f=
rom qapi:namespace or<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 qapi:module directives, try us=
ing those components to find a direct<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 match to the implied target na=
me.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 3. If both prior lookups fail, generate a s=
eries of regular expressions<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 looking for wildcard matches i=
n order from most to least<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 specific. Any explicitly provi=
ded components (namespace, module)<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 *must* match exactly, but both=
 contextual and entirely omitted<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 components are allowed to diff=
er from the search result. Note that if<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 more than one result is found,=
 Sphinx will emit a warning (a build<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 error for QEMU) and list all o=
f the candidate references.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The practical upshot is that in the large m=
ajority of cases, namespace<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and module information is not required when=
 creating simple `references`<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to definitions from within the same context=
 -- even when identical<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; definitions exist in other contexts.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Can you illustrate this this examples?<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; do wha?<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sorry, I went into the curve too fast.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The stuff under &quot;References now work like this&quot;=
 confuses me.=C2=A0 I guess it<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; describes a series of lookups to try one after the other.=
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I understand a cross-reference consists of namespace (opt=
ional), module<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (optional), name, and role.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Let&#39;s assume role is &quot;any&quot; for simplicity&#=
39;s sake.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Regarding &quot;1. If the explicit ...&quot;:<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0What is a reference&#39;s &quot;explic=
it reference target&quot;?=C2=A0 Examples might<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0help me understand.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; explicit lookup: `QMP:block-core:block-dirty-bitmap-add`<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; If that explicit target matches an object in the object datab=
ase<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; *directly*, we match immediately and don&#39;t consider other=
 potential<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; targets. This also applies to things like modules, e.g. `QMP:=
block-core`<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; even though the &quot;module&quot; is absent (it IS the modul=
e)<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; We always search for the explicit target no matter how un/ful=
ly qualified<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; it is.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0What is &quot;recorded in the domain&#=
39;s object registry&quot;?<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; domain.objects{} - essentially a record of every ObjectDefini=
tion&#39;s<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;fullname&quot; - the return value from QAPIDefinition._=
get_fqn().<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Can you show me a reference where this=
 lookup succeeds?<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; `QMP:block-core`<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; `QMP:block-core.block-dirty-bitmap-add`<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; So, for this lookup to work, the reference must either be of the f=
orm<br>
&gt;&gt; NAMESPACE:MODULE and resolve to that module in that namespace, or =
of the<br>
&gt;&gt; form NAMESPACE:MODULE:DEFN and resolve to that definition in that =
module<br>
&gt;&gt; in that namespace.=C2=A0 Correct?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Yes.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; These a &quot;fully qualified names (FQN)&quot; in your parlance, =
right?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; More or less, though as you found below...<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Note that the first form is syntactically indistinguishable from<b=
r>
&gt;&gt; NAMESPACE:DEFN, i.e. a reference to a definition that specifies th=
e<br>
&gt;&gt; namespace, but not the module.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; If the NAMESPACE:MODULE interpretation resolves, we never try the<=
br>
&gt;&gt; NAMESPACE:DEFN interpretation, because that happens in later steps=
.<br>
&gt;&gt; Correct?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; The first form is fully qualified only if it resolves as FQN.=C2=
=A0 So,<br>
&gt;&gt; whether such a reference is fully qualified is not syntactically<b=
r>
&gt;&gt; decidable.=C2=A0 Hmm.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; You&#39;re right. There is a weirdness here. I might need to do some m=
ore<br>
&gt; thinking to make sure it isn&#39;t theoretically a problem, but in pra=
ctice,<br>
&gt; right now, it isn&#39;t.<br>
<br>
Not a blocker, but please do your thinking :)<br>
<br>
&gt; Stay tuned, I guess.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Regarding &quot;2. If contextual information ...&quot;:<b=
r>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0I guess &quot;contextual information&q=
uot; is the context established by<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0qapi:namespace and qapi:module directi=
ves, i.e. the current<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0namespace and module, if any.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Yep!<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0If the cross reference lacks a namespa=
ce, we substitute the current<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0namespace.=C2=A0 Same for module.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0We then use that &quot;to find a direc=
t match to the implied target<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0name&quot;.=C2=A0 Sounds greek to me.=
=C2=A0 Example(s) might help.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; If namespace or module is missing from the link target, we tr=
y to fill in<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; the blanks with the contextual information if present.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Example, we are in the block-core section of the QEMU QMP ref=
erence manual<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; document and we reference `block-dirty-bitmap-add`. With cont=
ext, we are<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; able to assemble a fully qualified name:<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;QMP:block-core.block-dirty-bitmap-add`. This matches an=
 item in the<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; registry directly, so it matches and no further search is per=
formed.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; We try this lookup only when the reference lacks a namespace and w=
e are<br>
&gt;&gt; &quot;in&quot; a namespace, or when it lacks a module and we are &=
quot;in&quot; a module.<br>
&gt;&gt; Correct?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; or both: if we provided only a name but the context has both a namespa=
ce<br>
&gt; and module.<br>
<br>
So my or is inclusive :)<br>
<br>
&gt; essentially the algorithm splits the explicit target into (ns, mod, na=
me)<br>
&gt; and for any that are blank, we try to fill in those blanks with contex=
t<br>
&gt; info where available. Sometimes you have neither explicit nor contextu=
al<br>
&gt; info for a component.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Then we do a lookup for an exact match, in order;<br>

&gt; Yes!<br>

vise<br>
&gt; this. (question is: how soon do we need it?)<br>

hen writing simple<br>

<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; (2) We didn&#39;t provide a fully qualified target, and we ar=
e referencing<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; something from outside of the local context. For example, we =
are &quot;in&quot; a<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; module but we are trying to link to a different module&#39;s =
definition. e.g.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; we are in QMP:transaction and we reference `block-dirty-bitma=
p-add`. The<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; implied FQN will be QMP:transaction.block-dirty-bitmap.add, w=
hich will not<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; resolve.<br>
<br>
We skipped 1. because not fully qualified, and we failed 2. because<br>
context filled the gaps, but lookup failed.<br></blockquote><div><br></div>=

&gt;&gt; &gt; The fuzzy search portion has an order of precedence for how i=

&gt;&gt; &gt; and not all searches are tried universally, they are conditio=
nal to what<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; was provided in the reference target and what context is avai=
lable.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; 1. match against the explicitly provided namespace (module wa=
s not<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; explicitly provided)<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Look for the name in all of the namespace&#39;s modules?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Yeah. search for &quot;ns:*.name&quot; and &quot;ns:name&quot; basical=
ly.<br>
<br>
Got it.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; 2. match against the explicitly provided module (namespace wa=
s not<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; explicitly provided)<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Look for the name in all modules so named in all namespaces?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Yes.<br>
<br>
Got it.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; 3. match against the implied namespace (neither namespace/mod=
ule was<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; explicitly provided)<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; ?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>

contain definitions, but it also contains definitions directly.<br>

&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Look for the name anywhere?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I need examples :)<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; user gave `foo`. search for any qapi definition in all modules and<br>
&gt; namespaces for anything with the name &quot;foo&quot;. The broadest po=
ssible search.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Doesn&#39;t search for stuff outside of the QAPI domain directly, but =
be aware<br>
&gt; when using `references` that all domains are consulted, so it may in f=
act<br>
&gt; match something else from somewhere else, though not by any doing of t=
he<br>
&gt; qapi domain.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; i.e. :qapi:any:`foo` will definitely only search using the rules laid =
out<br>
&gt; in this patch/thread, but `foo` will consult all domains (and whine if=
 more<br>
&gt; than one result between all domains is identified.)<br>
<br>
Got it, I think.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; The searches are performed in order: if a search returns zero=
 results, the<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; next search is tried. If any search returns one or more resul=
ts, those<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; results are returned and we stop searching down the list. The=
 priority<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; order ensures that any explicitly provided information is *al=
ways* used to<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; find a match, but contextually provided information is merely=
 a &quot;hint&quot; and<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; can be ignored for the sake of a match.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; If find_obj() as a whole returns zero results, Sphinx emits a=
 warning for a<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; dangling reference. if find_obj() as a whole returns multiple=
 results,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Sphinx emits a warning for the ambiguous cross-reference.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; QEMU errors out on any such warnings under our normal build s=
ettings.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Clear as mud?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Clearer, but not quite mud, yet.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Ultimately, Search in this order and stop at any point any of these<br=
>
&gt; searches return at least one result:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 1. Explicitly provided name, whatever it is<br>
&gt; 2. FQN using contextual info<br>
&gt; 3. Explicitly provided NS; any module<br>
&gt; 4. Explicitly provided module; any NS<br>
&gt; 5. Contextual NS; any module<br>
&gt; 6. Contextual module; any NS<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; In summary:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; * Anything explicitly provided *must* match. This information is *neve=

&gt; by contrast, explicit info is used to directly filter and restrict sea=

Makes sense.<br>
