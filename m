Here I have a possibly common question about the choice of BqlCell and
future BqlRefCell. Pls refer my comment below...

I understand we need BqlRefCell instead of BqlCell for registers since
there may be more than one reference, e.g., callbacks from CharBackend
and MemoryRegion may hold multiple references at the same time, right?

If right, like HPET, with only MemoryRegion callbacks, reads and writes
I guess which should not be able to happen at the same time, so BqlCell
is also feasible, as is Irq?

(This piece of the thread model is a bit more complex, and I'm fully
aware that the right TYPE relies a lot on understanding the underlying
mechanism, which I'm not yet familiar enough with :-) ).

However, all in all, using BqlRefCell for register fields looks to be
always better than BqlCell.

Thank you! I'll change the current code to support this. Instead of
implementing a register space like PL011, I continue to handle registers
with u64 variables and bit macro definitions like the C version. Also
related to the above question, I'm a bit hesitant to use BqlCell directly
or RefCell for such u64 fields...

Sure, I'll drop current VMState support.

There must be a lot more opens :-(, such as the memattrs/timer binding,
which I hope to discuss with you at the later RFC!

Thank you! I see.
