If we want to expose a feature internally, IIUC we can use QAPI "features"
like this:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250603013810.4772-17-farosas@suse.de/

But I'm not yet sure whether it's useful..

In this case the "capability" itself should almost always be present when
using unix sockets..  The problem is, IIUC we're not trying to describe a
capability, but a choice the user made.

For example, when unix socket is the transport, we can still decide to not
use fd passing even if it's fully supported in the current QEMU binary for
any devices that are involved, because any of: (1) it could be a unix
socket to a proxy daemon (of a container?) when fd passing isn't supported
in the daemon, or (2) as you mentioned above, for debugging purpose when we
want to triage whether a bug is relevant to fd-passing.  Maybe more.

The per-device granularity you mentioned also makes sense to me.

An use case is when, imagine, we have a QEMU that (1) supports tap local
migration, but (2) doesn't yet support virtio-blk local migration.  Then we
want to be able to enable the fd-passing for tap/virtio-net, but not for
virtio-blk (even if the src QEMU in the context might support both)?

IOW, it makes sense to me to have two layers of controls here:

  (a) Migration new parameter, "migrate-fds" (or any better name..).

      When set, it enables all devices that supports fd-passing to migrate
      the fds directly.  OTOH, when not set, even if all devices enabled
      fd-passing, it should still do a full migration.  This one is the
      user knob saying "I want to migrate with fd migrated".

      This should imply unix sockets for sure as the transport, and should
      fail upfront if it's not a unix socket.

      We should also auto-select this with cpr migrations..  then in any
      code path (whenever such path exists?) that the fds can be either
      migrated from cpr or main channels.

  (b) Device new parameter, "migrate-fds" (or any better name..).

      When set, the device will declare support migrating fds "whenever the
      migration applies", aka, when above (a) is selected first.

      Taking tap device as example here, setting it ON here means "please
      enable fd-passing whenever the user enables this migration option".
      So in tap code, it should migrate fd if both (a) and (b) are ON.
      When migrating to e.g. old QEMUs, here (b) should be OFF even if (a)
      is ON.

Would above make sense?
