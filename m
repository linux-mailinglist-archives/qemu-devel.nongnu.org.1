The pro of putting it in the base machine class is that we don't need to
repeat the property creation in each machine as we broaden support to other
arches, I presume aarch64 is probably most likely future candidate.

The downside of putting it in the base machine class is that it limits
mgmt app ability to probe QEMU for support. ie it wouldn't be possible
to probe whether individual machines support it or not, as we broaden
QEMU support.

Then again, we will already face that limited ability to probe even on
x86, as we won't be able to query whether IGVM is SNP only, or has been
extended to TDX too.

With my libvirt hat on, probing is still probably the more important
factor, so would push towards putting the property just to individual
machine classes that definitely have been wired up to be able to use
it.

With regards,
Daniel
