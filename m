Ack, I am also curious why dedicated device state multifd channels bring
such downtime improvement.

Upon a closer inspection it looks like that there are, in fact, *two*
RAM syncs done during the downtime - besides the one at the end of
ram_save_complete() there's another on in find_dirty_block(). This function
is called earlier from ram_save_complete() -> ram_find_and_save_block().

Unfortunately, skipping that intermediate sync in find_dirty_block() and
moving the one from the end of ram_save_complete() to another SaveVMHandler
that's called only after VFIO device state transfer doesn't actually
improve downtime (at least not on its own).

I've been looking at this and added some measurements around device state
queuing for submission in multifd_queue_device_state().

To my surprise, the mixed RAM / device state config of 15/0 has *much*
lower total queuing time of around 100 msec compared to the dedicated
device state channels 15/4 config with total queuing time of around
300 msec.

Despite that, the 15/4 config still has significantly lower overall
downtime.

This means that any reason for the downtime difference is probably on
the receive / load side of the migration rather than on the save /
send side.

I guess the reason for the lower device state queuing time in the 15/0
case is that this data could be sent via any of the 15 multifd channels
rather than just the 4 dedicated ones in the 15/4 case.

Nevertheless, I will continue to look at this problem to at least find
some explanation for the difference in downtime that dedicated device
state multifd channels bring.
