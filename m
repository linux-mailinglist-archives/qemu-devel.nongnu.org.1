The "more or less" is rather heavy here: with the current API there is
no way to distinguish between interrupts and exceptions. Double-traps
can probably only be detected if you don't rely on weird, very error
prone heuristics around TB translations.

And as Alex Ben=C3=A9e pointed out, qemu can be easily built with plugins
disabled.

No, I have not made any performance measurements. However, given that
for every single TB execution a similar hook is called already, the
impact related to other existing plugin infrastructure _should_ be
neglectible.

That is, if your workload actually runs any code and is not constantly
bombarded with interrupts that _do_ result in a trap (which _may_ happen
during some tests).

So if you are performance sensitive enough to care, you will very likely
want to disable plugins anyway.

Julian
