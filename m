If no additional module is used, then GDB needs to execute the test_* scripts via '-x' option
because only this way the script can do "import gdb", hence we need a runner that will call gdb
and pass the script to it.

Naturally, we can instead use a module like pygdbmi (as Manos suggested) or aautils (with the
caveats I mentioned about having to deal with GDB packets directly) that will simply wrap up
calling gdb and passing it the script with subprocess etc., so no need to augment the test harness.

The trade off I can see is: re-use the runner we use in check-tcg and augment the test
harness to accommodate it in the functional tests _vs_ use the "runner" from another module,
bring another python dependency and deal with another GDB API (I like using GDB native Python
API because it's simple, sufficient and self-contained, but I'm open to experiment with pygdbmi),
use another runner (other than the one in tests/guest-debug/test_gdbstub.py) and don't modify the
test harness.


> You could redirect stdout of the script into a log file, so that it cannot mess with the TAP output of the test. Or is there something that I missed and this cannot work?

Yeah, I really tried it but redirecting to a file using GDB Python
API didn't work :-(

I've tried to redirect GDB's output from the test script using
"set logging redirect on" but something is off. I even tried on GDB
master, but besides direct not taking effect (output is still printed
to the stdout) I got a GDB internal error when switching it off.

So, yes, it would work (even adding a # in the output messages so the
TAP protocol would simply ignore the lines at the same time we would
be able to see the output from GDB), but I was not able to make it work
with GDB native Python API, so turned to use the "exitcode".


Cheers,
Gustavo
