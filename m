The m68k/arm archs have a nice macro for defining versions
that exposes major/minor directly. That would let us
automatically set the deprecation flag after 3 years,
avoiding manually writing patches for each release:

diff --git a/hw/arm/virt.c b/hw/arm/virt.c

             mc->alias = "virt"; \
         } \

we could easily change other arches to enable the same thing.

Then all we need do manually is the actual deletion. We would make
it a BUILD_BUG_ON after say 20 releases to force us to remember the
actual deletion at the 6 year point, without creating an immediate
build fail in that exact 18th release cycle.


With regards,
Daniel
