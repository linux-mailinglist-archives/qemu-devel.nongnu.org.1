I understand the FlatView is useful for memory_region_find(), and I 
think it also makes sense to assume that any guest-visible MemoryRegion 
is contained in an AddressSpace.

But, looking at the code again, I now wonder why the MemoryRegion was 
not contained in any AddressSpace before commit 55fa4be6f76a 
("virtio-pci: fix memory_region_find for VirtIOPCIRegion's MR"). I 
dropped the ASes in pci-bridge and ran the reproducer[1] but it still 
works. Perhaps the ASes may no longer be needed.

It unfortunately does not work for pci-bridge. It has the following 
function:

void pci_bridge_update_mappings(PCIBridge *br)
{
     PCIBridgeWindows *w = &br->windows;

     /* Make updates atomic to: handle the case of one VCPU updating the 
bridge
      * while another accesses an unaffected region. */
     memory_region_transaction_begin();
     pci_bridge_region_del(br, w);
     pci_bridge_region_cleanup(br, w);
     pci_bridge_region_init(br);
     memory_region_transaction_commit();
}

object_unparent() happens in pci_bridge_region_cleanup().
pci_bridge_region_init() reuses the storage.
memory_region_transaction_commit() triggers flatview_unref(), but it 
needs to happen before pci_bridge_region_init().

memory_region_transaction_commit() also has an undesirable 
characteristic that its effect may be delayed due to nesting. To make 
sure flatview_unref() happens with a particular call of 
memory_region_transaction_commit(), you need to traverse the possible 
call graph that lead to the function.

So I'm afraid but I don't think there is a better way to ensure 
correctness without a codebase-wide audit.
