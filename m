Yes, the parsers grows an untagged section until another section starts.
An untagged section can consist of multiple paragraphs, just like tagged
sections.

Editing accident, sorry!  You interpreted it correctly.

Okay.

Doesn't entirely clean up the terminology mess.  According to
docs/devel/qapi-code-gen.rst, struct and union types have members,
alternate types have alternatives, enum types have values, commands have
arguments, and events have event-specific data, which is a mouthful, so
we often say arguments.  Using one of them ("member") to refer to the
generalization of them all is suboptimal, but it's no worse than before.

ArgSection is even more general: it's features, too.  Again, no worse
than before.

I'm *not* asking you to clean this up.  I'm just pointing out we could
use fresh naming ideas here.

Point, but the other kinds of section are text, too.  "plain"?

I've long wanted strict in-order processing, to avoid surprising
reordering of input in the output.

Sounds good!
