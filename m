I see.  Both of those flags can legitimately get turned on while the 
interrupt routine is running, and under heavy load this could happen fairly 
frequently.  The SF (Start of Frame) interrupt occurs once every 
millisecond, and the WDH (Writeback Done Head) interrupt occurs more or 
less when a transfer completes.

To avoid the overhead of repeated interrupts, it would be best to check the 
interrupt status at the end of the routine and restart if any of the 
enabled bits are set, as in your first patch.

If you would like to clean it up (get rid of the debugging stuff) and 
submit it, I'll review it.

Nothing else really, just the remaining interrupt flag bits.
