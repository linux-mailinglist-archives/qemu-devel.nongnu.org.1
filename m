No objection to applying these fixups since you've done the work
already.

Based on the repeated cleanups, and your notes above that we still
have many problems though, can I again suggest we just adopt the
GCC/CLang extension of adding

  #pragma once

at the top of every header and burn all the #ifdefs.

It is easy & cheap to verify that it is present on every single .h file,
and there are no style variations to get wrong, or closing statements to
make inconsistent.

With regards,
Daniel
