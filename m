QEMU listing the extensions that it supports seems to me to be the
correct approach.

It's clunky that the list of "extensions" are constantly changing.
There isn't much we can do about that from a QEMU perspective though.

Listing the hardware and what it supports is the job of the DT.

I see your concern about what happens if the "extensions" are disabled
though. Realislity they probably never will be.

AFAIK the DT is correct. We are describing the hardware within the
scope of the DT spec.

If a new node exists that describes what the hardware does not support
we can update to support that as well.

I'm pretty sure there isn't anything for us to do differently here
right? It's just a bad situation that we are trying to support.
