Yes the principle use case is modelling asymmetric set ups with two sets
of CPU cores attached only by a piece of shared RAM with maybe a
signalling an IRQ. As the CPUs are doing the work we want to test both
sides (VirtIO device and driver) rather than provide an emulation.

Once we have a single QEMU binary that is dynamically configurable and
supports heterogeneous setups then we can model it within QEMU itself.
However until that point 2 QEMU's and some shared memory is the easiest
way to test such things.

This is currently being worked on as part of the larger HVAC project:

  https://linaro.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HVAC/overview

where we are working on a new VirtIO transport layer (virtio-msg) that
doesn't have the issues associated with lack of trapped configuration
space.
