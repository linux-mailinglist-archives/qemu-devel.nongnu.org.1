Giving my 2 cents here: at Linux Kernel, we're moving documentation
to tools/docs document because just scripts/ became too messy. Also,
having a directory specifically for python modules makes sense.
So, we just moved libraries to tools/python/lib.=20

In the specific case of kernel-doc + modules this is required at build
time, if docs are enabled.

Not quite: those files are the actual kernel-doc implementation.

The exec is just a shell to call them. At the Linux Kernel, we don't even
run kernel-doc exec anymore: they're called directly by the Sphinx=20
kerneldoc extension. We use the exec just to allow us to run manually,=20
as it can be helpful to see the ReST result when problems rise.

Right now on QEMU we're still running the exec, but this can change
some day.
