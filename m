Yes, I assume those are mainly useful with very large numbers of vCPUs
and/or PCI device passthrough? Neither of those are relevant on macOS
hosts. (One other thing they're useful with is device driver
development/testing/debugging - real Macs come with IOMMUs so
PCI/Thunderbolt device drivers MUST translate addresses for DMA correctly -
but that's very niche indeed.)

I encountered it while trying the aforementioned vIOMMU; macOS guests
seemed to use 64-bit instructions for accessing some of the registers.

I've just checked, and there actually seem to be some instruction emulation
tests in the kvm-unit-tests project; those are designed for KVM, but I
expect it should be possible to tweak some of them so they're useful for
testing HVF. kvm-unit-tests don't seem to be part of QEMU's regular test
suite at the moment though, as far as I can tell?

OK, that makes sense, thanks. At least this gives me a better idea of what
will be covered by CI and what won't when I'm reviewing patches.
