FYI, in x86 target the -cpu command has had a "migratable=bool" property
for a long time , which defaults to 'true' for 'host' model. This causes
QEMU to explicitly drop features which would otherwise prevent migration
between two hosts with identical physical CPUs.

IOW, if there are some bits present in 'host' that cause migration
problems on Ampere hosts, ideally either QEMU (or KVM kmod) would
detect them and turn them off automatically if migratable=true is
set. See commit message in 84f1b92f & 120eee7d1fd for some background
info

NB "migratable" is defined in i386 target code today, but conceptually
we should expand/move that to apply to all targets for consistency,
even if it is effectively a no-op some targets (eg if they are
guaranteed migratable out of the box already with '-cpu host').

With regards,
Daniel
