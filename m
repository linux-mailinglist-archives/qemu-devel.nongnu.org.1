Hi Manos,

on the host I use pipewire. The audio device used for playback and 
recording is a Intel HDA device. I also tested recording from the 
playback monitor of the HDA device. The important command line arguments 
are: ./qemu-system-x86_64 -machine q35 -device 
virtio-vga-gl,xres=1280,yres=768,bus=pcie.0 -display 
gtk,zoom-to-fit=off,gl=on -machine pcspk-audiodev=audio0 -device 
virtio-sound-pci,bus=pcie.0,audiodev=audio0 -audiodev 
pipewire,out.frequency=48000,in.frequency=48000,id=audio0

The guest is Linux OpenSUSE 15.5 system. The guest uses PulseAudio. This 
means audacity ALSA audio recording was routed through PulseAudio. 
Audacity doesn't really start recording but after a few seconds it 
reports 'Wait timed out' and 'Error opening sound device. Try changing 
the audio host, recording device and the project sample rate'.

When I start QEMU with -audiodev 
pipewire,out.mixing-engine=off,in.mixing-engine=off,id=audio0 audacity 
only records silence.

For playback I use Rhythmbox or Audacity. If you don't immediately hear 
dropouts try activating and deactivating the QEMU gtk window in quick 
succession. A slightly increased processor load like moving the mouse 
around also increases the dropout rate.

With best regards,
Volker
