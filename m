Side note, in it's current form this breaks the switch-cci support in upstr=
eam
QEMU.  I've finally gotten back to getting ready to look at MMPT support and
ran into a crash as a result.  Needs protection with checked object_dynamic=
_cast()
to make sure we have a type3 device.  I'll update the patch in my tree.

Thanks,

Jonathan
