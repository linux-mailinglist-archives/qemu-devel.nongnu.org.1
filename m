Then we won't use virtqueue_pop() at all, we need a SVQ version of
virtqueue_pop() to translate GPA to SVQ IOVA directly?

Would it be simpler if we decouple the IOVA allocator? For example, we
can have a dedicated gtree to track the allocated IOVA ranges. It is
shared by both

1) Guest memory (GPA)
2) SVQ virtqueue and buffers

And another gtree to track the GPA to IOVA.

The SVQ code could use either

1) one linear mappings that contains both SVQ virtqueue and buffers

or

2) dynamic IOVA allocation/deallocation helpers

So we don't actually need the third gtree for SVQ HVA -> SVQ IOVA?

So the idea is, for region_del/region_add use iova_gpa_map? For the
SVQ translation, use the iova_taddr_map?

I suspect we still need to synchronize with those two trees so it
might be still problematic as iova_taddr_map contains the overlapped
regions.

It uses g_tree_foreach() which I guess is not O(1).
