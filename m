Yes that's pretty much it.

Generally:

- embedded objects will have to be initialized in instance_init unless they
are Options

- sysbus_init_irq and sysbus_init_mmio can be called in both instance_init
and instance_post_init for now, but they will have to be in post_init once
the signature of init changes to return impl PinInit

- if you don't need properties you can choose between post_init and
realize, if you need properties you need to initialize in realize (and
then, unlike C, you might need to explicitly allow the pre-realize state;
for example using Option<&...> instead of just a reference; or Vec<>
instead of an array).

Allocation is still done by the C code, so I am not sure I understand the
question. Rust code allocates QOM objects with object_new() so they are
malloc-ed. I discussed it with Manos some time ago and in principle you
could use a Box (QOM supports custom freeing functions) but it's a bit
complex because the freeing function would have to free the memory without
dropping the contents of the Box (the drop is done by QOM via
instance_finalize).

If you want to allocate the HPETTimers at realize time, I think you can
place them in a Vec. I think you won't need NonNull for this, but I am not
100% sure. Alternatively if you want to always prepare all MAX_TIMERS of
them and then only use a subset, you can use an array.

Either way, probably it makes sense for you to have an "fn
timers_iter(&self) -> impl Iter<Item = &BqlRefCell<HPETTimer>>" in
HPETState, or something like that. Then you can easily use for loops to
walk all timers between 0 and self.num_timers-1.
