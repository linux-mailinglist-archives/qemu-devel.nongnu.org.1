Thanks for the steers. Just a note in case you're not aware - most of these
changes weren't authored by me, I'm in the position of picking up someone else's
series. I hope you'll bear with me in this respect.

Understandable, I will certainly make time to be more responsive when I do get
review comments. The last spin got none, whereas the earlier ones sent out by
Oracle got a good amount of review.

You mentioned on IRC that it's worth me documenting previous reviews: I can
spelunk for that data, but it's worth pointing out that many of the patches have
changed significantly since previous reviews.

>   - it's invasive in an already very complex subsystem

As a qemu neophyte I would greatly appreciate suggestions on how to reduce this.
I think the user-container refactoring was a big one (we now barely touch the
other container types), but I'm definitely up for further suggestions.

>   - it's HUGE. See the diffstat below ...

Unavoidable right? The start of the series are generic preparation so could in
theory be merged separately. If you have other ways you'd prefer me to split
this up I'd be happy to do so.

FYI I tried sending out just the specification document (which reflects the
already-merged server side implementation) but did not get any reviews.

> I would introduce a new hw/vfio-user/ subsystem given the size.

Could you give me some further guidance? Are you talking about duplicating all
of the needed hw/vfio/pci.c code into hw/vfio-user/pci.c ?

Or do you just mean putting the new hw/vfio/user* files into hw/vfio-user/

The ones I've written have longer changelogs and I hope are better. I'll take
some time to rewrite the other authors' commit messages for the next cycle.

Thanks so much!

Would you prefer me to apply your above suggestions prior to you reviewing?
