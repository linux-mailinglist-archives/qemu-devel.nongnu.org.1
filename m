I think it's not that absolute for dual-size targets. For x86 I would be
okay if the i386 target used essentially the x86-64 CPUState and frontend
when compiled as part of the single binary, despite the extra space used by
registers. The only difference would be that the  64-bit CPU models are not
available (or their long-mode feature flag is masked) and therefore
entering 64-bit mode is not possible.

Anyhow, it's all food for later thought. But it explains why my first idea
was to isolate TARGET_LONG_BITS and yours was to abstract it.
