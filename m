Background snapshot uses userfaultfd-wp rather than KVM_GET_DIRTY_LOG.  The
statement is still correct though, that userfault is only supported on
Linux in general (wp is one sub-feature, represents "write-protect mode")
so this should help portability, as it removes the dependency on the OS.

Let's directly use "fixed-ram" (or "mapped-ram", or whatever new name we
decide to use, as long as without "x-")?

migration_properties is not documented anywhere, mostly yet for debugging
purpose.  We could have dropped all the "x-"s, IMHO.
