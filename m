If we provided a mechanism to query the state of profiles, then they
should be 'true' when all their mandatory extensions are present. That
means that, despite defaulting to 'false', they should become true at
realize time after detecting all their mandatory extensions are present,
and then, if a user set the profile false, the user would be disabling
all the profile's extensions along with the profile.

Without a mechanism to query profiles, then it doesn't matter if they
remain false after realize, even if they should be true, but that's just
a coding decision (which probably deserves a code comment).

I would disable the extensions that G represents when G is explicitly
disabled, just as I suggest we do for profiles.

More extension shorthands are coming[1] and, IMO, they should be addressed
in the same way as G (whatever the final decision on how to address G is).
Since G collects such basic extensions, then it might be hard to reason as
to why it should be possible to disable it, but if, for example, you have
a CPU which supports the Zvkn extensions and you want to test/debug with
all of those extensions disabled, then it'd be nice to do zvkn=off and
expect all of them to be disabled.

I've already pointed out a couple times that disabling a profile may be
useful for scripts, particularly for bare-bones CPUs, since you know that
disabling something previously enabled is implementing a clean 'undo'.

I'm having trouble imaging this hypothetical user that knows how to
construction QEMU command lines, knows what profiles are meant to enable,
knows how boolean properties work, but would be surprised that
'profile=off' disabled the profile's mandatory extensions and not
surprised when 'profile=off' does nothing. So, for me, 'profile=off' doing
nothing looks like it'll introduce confusion, not the other way around.

I presume the user disabled extensions would need to come to the right of
the profiles on the command line to be respected.

Doesn't this just kick the can down the road? I suspect we'd end up
discussing what 'bare=false' means at that time.
