I looked at your "final" branch on GitHub and the refcount changes there
match what I was thinking of.

In case it helps for writing comments, I'll try to describe my mental
model of the refcounts:

- fuse_inc_in_flight()/fuse_dec_in_flight() must wrap the lifecycle of
  FUSE requests that the server is processing. This ensures that the
  block layer's drain operation waits for requests to complete and that
  the export cannot be deleted while the requests are still in progress.

- blk_exp_ref()/blk_exp_unref() prevents the export from being deleted
  while something that still depends on it remains outstanding.

How this maps to FUSE-over-io_uring:

- When an SQE is submitted blk_exp_ref() must be called. After the CQE
  has been processed, blk_exp_unref() must be called. This way the
  export cannot be deleted before all CQEs have been handled.

- The coroutine that processes a FUSE request must call
  fuse_inc_in_flight() before processing begins and fuse_dec_in_flight()
  after processing ends.

Thanks,
Stefan
