I think a purer Rust solution looks not too difficult for many of
the backends.

 * dtrace

   Use this crate https://crates.io/crates/usdt to generate
   Rust code from the .d file we already generate

 * ftrace

   A mere write() to a pre-opened FD

 * log

   A call to the qemu_log function, which can be exposed to rust

 * simple

   A call to some funcs in trace/simple.h which can be exposed
   to rust

 * syslog

   A call to syslog(), can be done with https://crates.io/crates/syslog

 * ust

   Unclear how to do this at a quick glance, but likely
   has a solution

Most of these rely on the trace_event_get_state macro which is
where we try to take some fast paths. So the hardest bit is likely
figuring out a nice way to represent the 'state check' in Rust
without it always turning into a function call.

IMHO a core requirement for this must be that we can seemlessly trace
across Rust and C code using the same mechanism.

With my developer hat on, 99% of the time I'm just using the 'log'
backend because it is soooooo simple, very effective for dev use
and we enable it by default.

With my distro hat on, we enable 'dtrace' because that gives us a
low-overhead probe facility for tracing production deployments,
AND crucially it gives us system-global tracing facility across
the kernel, QEMU and all other apps.

IOW, my POV is that support for the "log" and "dtrace" backends
is mandatory for the Rust layer as a minium viable baseline.


I question the usefulness of the 'syslog' trace target. I can't see
it being desirable as a option for 'production' builds, and it seems
uneccessarily indirect for developers. What's its compelling USP ?

WRT 'ftrace', IIUC, the Linux 'perf' command has built-in support
for using USDT probes now:

  https://www.brendangregg.com/perf.html#StaticUserTracing

Do we still have a compelling USP for the 'ftrace' backend, if we
can use 'perf' for this ?

WRT 'ust', in LTTng, I see reference to the ability to use USDT probes,
so I wonder if we still need a dedicated 'ust' backend around ?

Potentially we're down to three options 'log', 'simple', and 'dtrace'.

With regards,
Daniel
