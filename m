QEMU doesn't link to either of those libraries. We preferentially use
gnutls, with a fallback to gcrypt or nettle, to avoid the murky openssl
licensing situation, and to a lesser extent because openssl has an
unpleasant API to use. mbedtls isn't used because it is a more niche
solution compared to what we already support, so wasn't compelling to
support.

Daniel
