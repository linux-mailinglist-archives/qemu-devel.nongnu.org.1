Have you tried to do this with VFIO and do semi-realtime audio (e.g.
AV work, gaming) with this backend?

In my experience, gapless and "crackle-less" semi-realtime audio is
unnecessarily difficult to do well with GStreamer right now.

Don't get me wrong, I *like* GStreamer, but I don't think it's as good
in this case as it is being positioned.

GStreamer is a painful dependency on non-POSIX platforms, so I don't
think that our non-POSIX consumers would be happy about this.

Personally, I'd keep around at least the SDL Audio and PipeWire
backends too. That gives decent coverage and lets people avoid
problematic build and runtime dependencies.
