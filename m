-Postcopy
-========
-
-'Postcopy' migration is a way to deal with migrations that refuse to converge
-(or take too long to converge) its plus side is that there is an upper bound on
-the amount of migration traffic and time it takes, the down side is that during
-the postcopy phase, a failure of *either* side causes the guest to be lost.
-
-In postcopy the destination CPUs are started before all the memory has been
-transferred, and accesses to pages that are yet to be transferred cause
-a fault that's translated by QEMU into a request to the source QEMU.
-
-Postcopy can be combined with precopy (i.e. normal migration) so that if precopy
-doesn't finish in a given time the switch is made to postcopy.
-
-Enabling postcopy
------------------
-
-To enable postcopy, issue this command on the monitor (both source and
-destination) prior to the start of migration:
-
-``migrate_set_capability postcopy-ram on``
-
-The normal commands are then used to start a migration, which is still
-started in precopy mode.  Issuing:
-
-``migrate_start_postcopy``
-
-will now cause the transition from precopy to postcopy.
-It can be issued immediately after migration is started or any
-time later on.  Issuing it after the end of a migration is harmless.
-
-Blocktime is a postcopy live migration metric, intended to show how
-long the vCPU was in state of interruptible sleep due to pagefault.
-That metric is calculated both for all vCPUs as overlapped value, and
-separately for each vCPU. These values are calculated on destination
-side.  To enable postcopy blocktime calculation, enter following
-command on destination monitor:
-
-``migrate_set_capability postcopy-blocktime on``
-
-Postcopy blocktime can be retrieved by query-migrate qmp command.
-postcopy-blocktime value of qmp command will show overlapped blocking
-time for all vCPU, postcopy-vcpu-blocktime will show list of blocking
-time per vCPU.
-
-.. note::
-  During the postcopy phase, the bandwidth limits set using
-  ``migrate_set_parameter`` is ignored (to avoid delaying requested pages that
-  the destination is waiting for).
-
-Postcopy device transfer
-------------------------
-
-Loading of device data may cause the device emulation to access guest RAM
-that may trigger faults that have to be resolved by the source, as such
-the migration stream has to be able to respond with page data *during* the
-device load, and hence the device data has to be read from the stream completely
-before the device load begins to free the stream up.  This is achieved by
-'packaging' the device data into a blob that's read in one go.
-
-Source behaviour
-----------------
-
-Until postcopy is entered the migration stream is identical to normal
-precopy, except for the addition of a 'postcopy advise' command at
-the beginning, to tell the destination that postcopy might happen.
-When postcopy starts the source sends the page discard data and then
-forms the 'package' containing:
-
-   - Command: 'postcopy listen'
-   - The device state
-
-     A series of sections, identical to the precopy streams device state stream
-     containing everything except postcopiable devices (i.e. RAM)
-   - Command: 'postcopy run'
-
-The 'package' is sent as the data part of a Command: ``CMD_PACKAGED``, and the
-contents are formatted in the same way as the main migration stream.
-
-During postcopy the source scans the list of dirty pages and sends them
-to the destination without being requested (in much the same way as precopy),
-however when a page request is received from the destination, the dirty page
-scanning restarts from the requested location.  This causes requested pages
-to be sent quickly, and also causes pages directly after the requested page
-to be sent quickly in the hope that those pages are likely to be used
-by the destination soon.
-
-Destination behaviour
----------------------
-
-Initially the destination looks the same as precopy, with a single thread
-reading the migration stream; the 'postcopy advise' and 'discard' commands
-are processed to change the way RAM is managed, but don't affect the stream
-processing.

-- On receipt of ``CMD_PACKAGED`` (1)
-
-   All the data associated with the package - the ( ... ) section in the diagram -
-   is read into memory, and the main thread recurses into qemu_loadvm_state_main
-   to process the contents of the package (2) which contains commands (3,6) and
-   devices (4...)
-
-- On receipt of 'postcopy listen' - 3 -(i.e. the 1st command in the package)
-
-   a new thread (a) is started that takes over servicing the migration stream,
-   while the main thread carries on loading the package.   It loads normal
-   background page data (b) but if during a device load a fault happens (5)
-   the returned page (c) is loaded by the listen thread allowing the main
-   threads device load to carry on.
-
-- The last thing in the ``CMD_PACKAGED`` is a 'RUN' command (6)
-
-   letting the destination CPUs start running.  At the end of the
-   ``CMD_PACKAGED`` (7) the main thread returns to normal running behaviour and
-   is no longer used by migration, while the listen thread carries on servicing
-   page data until the end of migration.
-
-Postcopy Recovery
------------------
-
-Comparing to precopy, postcopy is special on error handlings.  When any
-error happens (in this case, mostly network errors), QEMU cannot easily
-fail a migration because VM data resides in both source and destination
-QEMU instances.  On the other hand, when issue happens QEMU on both sides
-will go into a paused state.  It'll need a recovery phase to continue a
-paused postcopy migration.
-
-The recovery phase normally contains a few steps:
-
-  - When network issue occurs, both QEMU will go into PAUSED state
-
-  - When the network is recovered (or a new network is provided), the admin
-    can setup the new channel for migration using QMP command
-    'migrate-recover' on destination node, preparing for a resume.
-
-  - On source host, the admin can continue the interrupted postcopy
-    migration using QMP command 'migrate' with resume=true flag set.
-
-  - After the connection is re-established, QEMU will continue the postcopy
-    migration on both sides.
-
-During a paused postcopy migration, the VM can logically still continue
-running, and it will not be impacted from any page access to pages that
-were already migrated to destination VM before the interruption happens.
-However, if any of the missing pages got accessed on destination VM, the VM
-thread will be halted waiting for the page to be migrated, it means it can
-be halted until the recovery is complete.
-
-The impact of accessing missing pages can be relevant to different
-configurations of the guest.  For example, when with async page fault
-enabled, logically the guest can proactively schedule out the threads
-accessing missing pages.
-
-Postcopy states
----------------
-
-Postcopy moves through a series of states (see postcopy_state) from
-ADVISE->DISCARD->LISTEN->RUNNING->END
-
- - Advise
-
-    Set at the start of migration if postcopy is enabled, even
-    if it hasn't had the start command; here the destination
-    checks that its OS has the support needed for postcopy, and performs
-    setup to ensure the RAM mappings are suitable for later postcopy.
-    The destination will fail early in migration at this point if the
-    required OS support is not present.
-    (Triggered by reception of POSTCOPY_ADVISE command)
-
- - Discard
-
-    Entered on receipt of the first 'discard' command; prior to
-    the first Discard being performed, hugepages are switched off
-    (using madvise) to ensure that no new huge pages are created
-    during the postcopy phase, and to cause any huge pages that
-    have discards on them to be broken.
-
- - Listen
-
-    The first command in the package, POSTCOPY_LISTEN, switches
-    the destination state to Listen, and starts a new thread
-    (the 'listen thread') which takes over the job of receiving
-    pages off the migration stream, while the main thread carries
-    on processing the blob.  With this thread able to process page
-    reception, the destination now 'sensitises' the RAM to detect
-    any access to missing pages (on Linux using the 'userfault'
-    system).
-
- - Running
-
-    POSTCOPY_RUN causes the destination to synchronise all
-    state and start the CPUs and IO devices running.  The main
-    thread now finishes processing the migration package and
-    now carries on as it would for normal precopy migration
-    (although it can't do the cleanup it would do as it
-    finishes a normal migration).
-
- - Paused
-
-    Postcopy can run into a paused state (normally on both sides when
-    happens), where all threads will be temporarily halted mostly due to
-    network errors.  When reaching paused state, migration will make sure
-    the qemu binary on both sides maintain the data without corrupting
-    the VM.  To continue the migration, the admin needs to fix the
-    migration channel using the QMP command 'migrate-recover' on the
-    destination node, then resume the migration using QMP command 'migrate'
-    again on source node, with resume=true flag set.
-
- - End
-
-    The listen thread can now quit, and perform the cleanup of migration
-    state, the migration is now complete.
-
-Source side page map
---------------------
-
-The 'migration bitmap' in postcopy is basically the same as in the precopy,
-where each of the bit to indicate that page is 'dirty' - i.e. needs
-sending.  During the precopy phase this is updated as the CPU dirties
-pages, however during postcopy the CPUs are stopped and nothing should
-dirty anything any more. Instead, dirty bits are cleared when the relevant
-pages are sent during postcopy.
-
-Postcopy with hugepages
------------------------
-
-Postcopy now works with hugetlbfs backed memory:
-
-  a) The linux kernel on the destination must support userfault on hugepages.
-  b) The huge-page configuration on the source and destination VMs must be
-     identical; i.e. RAMBlocks on both sides must use the same page size.
-  c) Note that ``-mem-path /dev/hugepages``  will fall back to allocating normal
-     RAM if it doesn't have enough hugepages, triggering (b) to fail.
-     Using ``-mem-prealloc`` enforces the allocation using hugepages.
-  d) Care should be taken with the size of hugepage used; postcopy with 2MB
-     hugepages works well, however 1GB hugepages are likely to be problematic
-     since it takes ~1 second to transfer a 1GB hugepage across a 10Gbps link,
-     and until the full page is transferred the destination thread is blocked.
-
-Postcopy with shared memory
----------------------------
-
-Postcopy migration with shared memory needs explicit support from the other
-processes that share memory and from QEMU. There are restrictions on the type of
-memory that userfault can support shared.
-
-The Linux kernel userfault support works on ``/dev/shm`` memory and on ``hugetlbfs``
-(although the kernel doesn't provide an equivalent to ``madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)``
-for hugetlbfs which may be a problem in some configurations).
-
-The vhost-user code in QEMU supports clients that have Postcopy support,
-and the ``vhost-user-bridge`` (in ``tests/``) and the DPDK package have changes
-to support postcopy.
-
-The client needs to open a userfaultfd and register the areas
-of memory that it maps with userfault.  The client must then pass the
-userfaultfd back to QEMU together with a mapping table that allows
-fault addresses in the clients address space to be converted back to
-RAMBlock/offsets.  The client's userfaultfd is added to the postcopy
-fault-thread and page requests are made on behalf of the client by QEMU.
-QEMU performs 'wake' operations on the client's userfaultfd to allow it
-to continue after a page has arrived.
-
-.. note::
-  There are two future improvements that would be nice:
-    a) Some way to make QEMU ignorant of the addresses in the clients
-       address space
-    b) Avoiding the need for QEMU to perform ufd-wake calls after the
-       pages have arrived
-
-Retro-fitting postcopy to existing clients is possible:
-  a) A mechanism is needed for the registration with userfault as above,
-     and the registration needs to be coordinated with the phases of
-     postcopy.  In vhost-user extra messages are added to the existing
-     control channel.
-  b) Any thread that can block due to guest memory accesses must be
-     identified and the implication understood; for example if the
-     guest memory access is made while holding a lock then all other
-     threads waiting for that lock will also be blocked.
-
-Postcopy Preemption Mode
-------------------------
-
-Postcopy preempt is a new capability introduced in 8.0 QEMU release, it
-allows urgent pages (those got page fault requested from destination QEMU
-explicitly) to be sent in a separate preempt channel, rather than queued in
-the background migration channel.  Anyone who cares about latencies of page
-faults during a postcopy migration should enable this feature.  By default,
-it's not enabled.

+to the destination without being requested (in much the same way as precopy),
+however when a page request is received from the destination, the dirty page
+scanning restarts from the requested location.  This causes requested pages
+to be sent quickly, and also causes pages directly after the requested page
+to be sent quickly in the hope that those pages are likely to be used
+by the destination soon.
+
+Destination behaviour
+---------------------
+
+Initially the destination looks the same as precopy, with a single thread
+reading the migration stream; the 'postcopy advise' and 'discard' commands
+are processed to change the way RAM is managed, but don't affect the stream
+processing.
+

+                                     |        \___
+                                     v            \

+
+                                     a   b        c
+  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+- On receipt of ``CMD_PACKAGED`` (1)
+
+   All the data associated with the package - the ( ... ) section in the diagram -
+   is read into memory, and the main thread recurses into qemu_loadvm_state_main
+   to process the contents of the package (2) which contains commands (3,6) and
+   devices (4...)
+
+- On receipt of 'postcopy listen' - 3 -(i.e. the 1st command in the package)
+
+   a new thread (a) is started that takes over servicing the migration stream,
+   while the main thread carries on loading the package.   It loads normal
+   background page data (b) but if during a device load a fault happens (5)
+   the returned page (c) is loaded by the listen thread allowing the main
+   threads device load to carry on.
+
+- The last thing in the ``CMD_PACKAGED`` is a 'RUN' command (6)
+
+   letting the destination CPUs start running.  At the end of the
+   ``CMD_PACKAGED`` (7) the main thread returns to normal running behaviour and
+   is no longer used by migration, while the listen thread carries on servicing
+   page data until the end of migration.
+
+Postcopy Recovery
+-----------------
+
+Comparing to precopy, postcopy is special on error handlings.  When any
+error happens (in this case, mostly network errors), QEMU cannot easily
+fail a migration because VM data resides in both source and destination
+QEMU instances.  On the other hand, when issue happens QEMU on both sides
+will go into a paused state.  It'll need a recovery phase to continue a
+paused postcopy migration.
+
+The recovery phase normally contains a few steps:
+
+  - When network issue occurs, both QEMU will go into PAUSED state
+
+  - When the network is recovered (or a new network is provided), the admin
+    can setup the new channel for migration using QMP command
+    'migrate-recover' on destination node, preparing for a resume.
+
+  - On source host, the admin can continue the interrupted postcopy
+    migration using QMP command 'migrate' with resume=true flag set.
+
+  - After the connection is re-established, QEMU will continue the postcopy
+    migration on both sides.
+
+During a paused postcopy migration, the VM can logically still continue
+running, and it will not be impacted from any page access to pages that
+were already migrated to destination VM before the interruption happens.
+However, if any of the missing pages got accessed on destination VM, the VM
+thread will be halted waiting for the page to be migrated, it means it can
+be halted until the recovery is complete.
+
+The impact of accessing missing pages can be relevant to different
+configurations of the guest.  For example, when with async page fault
+enabled, logically the guest can proactively schedule out the threads
+accessing missing pages.
+
+Postcopy states
+---------------
+
+Postcopy moves through a series of states (see postcopy_state) from
+ADVISE->DISCARD->LISTEN->RUNNING->END
+
+ - Advise
+
+    Set at the start of migration if postcopy is enabled, even
+    if it hasn't had the start command; here the destination
+    checks that its OS has the support needed for postcopy, and performs
+    setup to ensure the RAM mappings are suitable for later postcopy.
+    The destination will fail early in migration at this point if the
+    required OS support is not present.
+    (Triggered by reception of POSTCOPY_ADVISE command)
+
+ - Discard
+
+    Entered on receipt of the first 'discard' command; prior to
+    the first Discard being performed, hugepages are switched off
+    (using madvise) to ensure that no new huge pages are created
+    during the postcopy phase, and to cause any huge pages that
+    have discards on them to be broken.
+
+ - Listen
+
+    The first command in the package, POSTCOPY_LISTEN, switches
+    the destination state to Listen, and starts a new thread
+    (the 'listen thread') which takes over the job of receiving
+    pages off the migration stream, while the main thread carries
+    on processing the blob.  With this thread able to process page
+    reception, the destination now 'sensitises' the RAM to detect
+    any access to missing pages (on Linux using the 'userfault'
+    system).
+
+ - Running
+
+    POSTCOPY_RUN causes the destination to synchronise all
+    state and start the CPUs and IO devices running.  The main
+    thread now finishes processing the migration package and
+    now carries on as it would for normal precopy migration
+    (although it can't do the cleanup it would do as it
+    finishes a normal migration).
+
+ - Paused
+
+    Postcopy can run into a paused state (normally on both sides when
+    happens), where all threads will be temporarily halted mostly due to
+    network errors.  When reaching paused state, migration will make sure
+    the qemu binary on both sides maintain the data without corrupting
+    the VM.  To continue the migration, the admin needs to fix the
+    migration channel using the QMP command 'migrate-recover' on the
+    destination node, then resume the migration using QMP command 'migrate'
+    again on source node, with resume=true flag set.
+
+ - End
+
+    The listen thread can now quit, and perform the cleanup of migration
+    state, the migration is now complete.
+
+Source side page map
+--------------------
+
+The 'migration bitmap' in postcopy is basically the same as in the precopy,
+where each of the bit to indicate that page is 'dirty' - i.e. needs
+sending.  During the precopy phase this is updated as the CPU dirties
+pages, however during postcopy the CPUs are stopped and nothing should
+dirty anything any more. Instead, dirty bits are cleared when the relevant
+pages are sent during postcopy.
+
+Postcopy with hugepages
+-----------------------
+
+Postcopy now works with hugetlbfs backed memory:
+
+  a) The linux kernel on the destination must support userfault on hugepages.
+  b) The huge-page configuration on the source and destination VMs must be
+     identical; i.e. RAMBlocks on both sides must use the same page size.
+  c) Note that ``-mem-path /dev/hugepages``  will fall back to allocating normal
+     RAM if it doesn't have enough hugepages, triggering (b) to fail.
+     Using ``-mem-prealloc`` enforces the allocation using hugepages.
+  d) Care should be taken with the size of hugepage used; postcopy with 2MB
+     hugepages works well, however 1GB hugepages are likely to be problematic
+     since it takes ~1 second to transfer a 1GB hugepage across a 10Gbps link,
+     and until the full page is transferred the destination thread is blocked.
+
+Postcopy with shared memory
+---------------------------
+
+Postcopy migration with shared memory needs explicit support from the other
+processes that share memory and from QEMU. There are restrictions on the type of
+memory that userfault can support shared.
+
+The Linux kernel userfault support works on ``/dev/shm`` memory and on ``hugetlbfs``
+(although the kernel doesn't provide an equivalent to ``madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)``
+for hugetlbfs which may be a problem in some configurations).
+
+The vhost-user code in QEMU supports clients that have Postcopy support,
+and the ``vhost-user-bridge`` (in ``tests/``) and the DPDK package have changes
+to support postcopy.
+
+The client needs to open a userfaultfd and register the areas
+of memory that it maps with userfault.  The client must then pass the
+userfaultfd back to QEMU together with a mapping table that allows
+fault addresses in the clients address space to be converted back to
+RAMBlock/offsets.  The client's userfaultfd is added to the postcopy
+fault-thread and page requests are made on behalf of the client by QEMU.
+QEMU performs 'wake' operations on the client's userfaultfd to allow it
+to continue after a page has arrived.
+
+.. note::
+  There are two future improvements that would be nice:
+    a) Some way to make QEMU ignorant of the addresses in the clients
+       address space
+    b) Avoiding the need for QEMU to perform ufd-wake calls after the
+       pages have arrived
+
+Retro-fitting postcopy to existing clients is possible:
+  a) A mechanism is needed for the registration with userfault as above,
+     and the registration needs to be coordinated with the phases of
+     postcopy.  In vhost-user extra messages are added to the existing
+     control channel.
+  b) Any thread that can block due to guest memory accesses must be
+     identified and the implication understood; for example if the
+     guest memory access is made while holding a lock then all other
+     threads waiting for that lock will also be blocked.
+
+Postcopy Preemption Mode
+------------------------
+
+Postcopy preempt is a new capability introduced in 8.0 QEMU release, it
+allows urgent pages (those got page fault requested from destination QEMU
+explicitly) to be sent in a separate preempt channel, rather than queued in
+the background migration channel.  Anyone who cares about latencies of page
+faults during a postcopy migration should enable this feature.  By default,
+it's not enabled.
