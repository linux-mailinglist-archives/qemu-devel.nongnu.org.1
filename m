Yes. But is migration the only operation with vm which requires block layer be activated? I think actually a lot of operation require that.. Any block-layer releated qmp command actually. And do automatic activation in all of them I think is a wrong way.

Moreover, if we have explicit possibility to "postpone activation", we should provide a way to "activate by hand".

So I still think correct fix is reporting error from qmp_migrate when block-layer is inactive, and add some possibility to activate through QMP.
