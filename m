I did think about it :) That's why I wrote this in the cover-letter; not
sure if you noticed it:

    I replaced the "TCG vCPU Features" heading with "PAuth" because of
    this: before this change, the section says, it is about "CPU
    features that are specific to TCG".  But it has only PAuth-related
    parameters under it.  Since PAuth is relevant to both KVM and TCG, I
    moved them under a separate PAuth section, instead of duplicating
    it.

    But now we have a small inconsistency - there's a KVM-only CPU
    features section, but no TCG-only section.  I thought when there are
    more TCG-only CPU features, that section can be added back in.  Or I
    can add that back in, if anyone feels strongly about it.

> SME and RME and TCG only if am not wrong while PAUTH and SVE are both
> KVM and TCG

I didn't know that.  I read the docs a bit more closer about SME, RME,
and SVE, and did some quick `git-annotate` analysis:

  - "SME is not supported by KVM at this time" — this was added in
    commit e74c097638 (target/arm: Add cpu properties for SME,
    2022-06-20).

    If it is still accurate, then yes, SME looks to be TCG-only.

  - "The status of RME support with QEMU is experimental" — this was
    added in commit 57223a4c24 (docs/system/arm: Document FEAT_RME,
    2023-06-22).

    The phrase "with QEMU" doesn't quite decisively tell me whether it
    is experimental for TCG-only, or if it also applies for KVM.  Maybe
    Richard (in Cc) can tell us more.

  - SVE seems to be for both KVM and TCG, as the section "SVE CPU
    Property Dependencies and Constraints" talks about KVM.

  - PAuth is both KVM and TCG.

Yeah, it can be done.  Would you be okay if I do it as a follow-up?  As
this a re-work of the entire doc with several features.

Yes, make sense.
