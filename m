We've been lazy and avoided using gnutls_bye because it adds a
bunch more complexity to the shutdown sequence, and premature
shutdown from an malicious attack would be expected to cause
the QEMU protocol in the TLS channel to fail anyway.

Depends if the protocol we run over TLS can identify premature
termination itself, or whether it relies on TLS to identify
it.
