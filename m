Maybe that's unlikely as this register is for controlling A20 line of 
Intel CPUs so probably there's no use for it in a MIPS or PPC board but 
I'm not sure if it may be used for something else.

The direction is probably good as these chips have a pin for A20 control 
and handle the register themselves but I'm not sure this series is the 
right way. One immediate problem is that TYPE_PORT92 has state which is in 
the migration stream so moving it elsewhere would break migration which 
would need to be handled. Does this series handle that? I'm not sure it's 
worth the effort though if it results in more comlex code. If the 
migration issue is handled, then I think we should get rid of TYPE_PORT92 
completely and just add the one reg and qemu_irq modeling the output pin 
as qemu_gpio to the south bridge implementations directly, not embedding a 
separate object for it as these south bridges may already have some io 
region for ports and state where the reg can be stored so it could be 
added there instead of just moving the TYPE_PORT92 there. But with the 
migration issue it's probably easier to just leave it as it is now. Even 
if this would model the real chip better, it would result in more code and 
complexity in QEMU so not sure it's a good idea because of that.

That's a generic problem for dynamic or declarative machine creation to 
solve. Likely the machine description will also need to describe the 
connections between devices, not just what devices to instantiate. So 
that's not specific to port92. As we're not there yet it's also not urgent 
to touch this port92 stuff.

Maybe I overestimate the migration issue as I'm not familiar with that so 
if others think it's not an issue then I'm not against this series as it 
would bring the model closer to the actual hardware but then go all the 
way and get rid of TYPE_PORT92 and just implement it in the south bridges. 
But due to how it's currently done and how that's now baked in because of 
backward compatibility requrement for migration, I'm not sure it would 
really simplify the code, so we may need to live with what we have now. 
But let me know if I'm wrong and missed something.
