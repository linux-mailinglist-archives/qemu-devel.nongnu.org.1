Thank you for the reminder, I already used it in other contexts but 
forgot it here. I'll add it to my toolshed.

Regarding reflink: that requires FS support, which AFAIKS is only 
supported by BTRFS and XFS (and OCFS2). So using `-snapshot` or an 
explicit `qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b $base.qcow2 $overlay.qcow2` works 
on any FS.

Good to know, thank you. My problem is that I have to clone multiple VMs 
belonging together, they must be able to communicate with each other 
using their unmodified IP addresses; I only need to connect to one of 
them from the outside; something like a "jump host".

Thanks again
Philipp
