This feels like only half a solution, and not the most helpful half.
It prevents you accidentally migrating to a host that lacks some
features, but doesn't help with starting a VM that has migrate
compatible features in the first place.

From a user POV, the latter is what's most important. Checking for
incompatible features is just a safety net that you should never
need to hit, if QEMU was configured suitably to start with.

So to ensure a QEMU is started with migration compatible features
will still require teaching libvirt about every single feature
that has a host kernel dependancy, so libvirt (or the app using
libvirt) knows to turn this off. This is alot more work for both
libvirt & the mgmt app, than having QEMU provide the generic
"platforms" concept which is extensible without needing further
work outside QEMU.

With regards,
Daniel
