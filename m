Hi, following up from my KVM forum talk (
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGbz3WwvqLw ) I wanted to ask about what
version of Sphinx we could use as a minimum version to help ease the burden
of modernizing our QMP docs without a long backwards compatibility tail
(and hundreds of lines of compatibility goop to make it happen.)

First, some necessary background on the current state of our Python
environment and build system:

Paolo and I worked on a Python virtual environment tied to the QEMU build
system (python/scripts/mkvenv.py) which performs various setup actions
necessary to instantiate python *stuff* to ensure the build works and is
always using the correct, configured Python interpreter.

Currently, configure will invoke mkvenv in such a fashion that it prefers
any local packages you have installed: notably, meson, sphinx, and
sphinx-rtd-theme if you already have them installed from your distro's
repository will be used *if they use the version of python you specified to
configure* (or they match the version that configure guessed if you didn't
specify one.)

For meson, if you don't meet the minimum version, we will install a version
for you from our vendored whl files in the repository/tarball.

For sphinx, if you don't meet the minimum version and you have specified
--enable-docs, we'll install a version from the internet, from PyPI. If you
did not specify --enable-docs, we disable docs.

We did it this way because:
- It's *really fast* if you already have the dependencies you need
- meson is easy to vendor as a .whl because it's pure python, has *zero*
dependencies, and it's absolutely required for the build.
- docs are not *required* to build QEMU
- We went out of our way to ensure that QEMU could be built in an offline,
isolated environment on all of our supported platforms.

That being said:

The current reality is that Sphinx 3.4.3 is our minimum because RHEL 9
offers that as the distro package and I have not dared bump our version
beyond that for fear of disrupting our ability to build docs on RHEL 9
without internet.

What I'd like to ask is: How adamant are we that we can build docs on older
platforms? Do we consider it part of our platform promise? Can we bump
Sphinx to a slightly newer version at the expense of offline doc builds for
RHEL 9?

To reiterate: interactive developer builds from git or source tarballs
would continue to work (and be able to build docs just fine) so long as
--enable-docs is passed, but will require an internet connection to set up
the python environment with a new-enough sphinx. RHEL 9 rpm builds of
bleeding edge QEMU may be cut off from building docs in isolated RPMBUILD
environments unless that repository backports a newer sphinx that can be
identified as a dependency in the specfile.

How much of a problem do we consider that to be?

CCing the usual suspects.
