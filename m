I think there's no such agreement and QEMU is more lax about it both for 
historical reasons and to simplify machine models. Indeed, QEMU sometimes 
models non-existing machines (e.g. the mac99 or virt boards) that don't 
correspond to real hardware but allow guest OSes to boot. Even when 
modelllng real hardware it's ofren modelled just enough for guests to work 
and unused details are omitted for simplicity. It is recommended to follow 
what real hardware does when modelling real hardware but not always 
required. Although it might help both with verifying a device model and to 
compose machines with these models to try to follow the real hardware.

So port92 is not a real hardware but a QEMU abstraction or model of some 
functionality found in some machines. Real chips probably implement this 
in different ways so we could either model this in these chips 
independently the same way as real hardware does or use the abstracted 
model anywhere in our machine model. Since this does not exist in real 
hardware as this abstract model it also does not belong anywhere so we are 
free to put it where it's most convenient or simple to do.

Try git log -p 4ccd5fe22fe (found it via git blame and see what added that 
property).

Only if you want to break downsteam users of those options but maybe they 
won't be happy about that.
