Hi Albert,
I will be offline next week. I've posted comments.

I think the hard part will be adjusting vhost-user backend code to make
use of MEM_READ/MEM_WRITE when address translation fails. Ideally every
guest memory access (including vring accesses) should fall back to
MEM_READ/MEM_WRITE.

A good test for MEM_READ/MEM_WRITE is to completely skip setting the
memory table from the frontend and fall back for every guest memory
access. If the vhost-user backend still works without a memory table
then you know MEM_READ/MEM_WRITE is working too.

The vhost-user spec should probably contain a comment explaining that
MEM_READ/MEM_WRITE may be necessary when other device backends use
SHMEM_MAP due to the incomplete memory table that prevents translating
those memory addresses. In other words, if the guest has a device that
uses SHMEM_MAP, then all other vhost-user devices should support
MEM_READ/MEM_WRITE in order to ensure that DMA works with Shared Memory
Regions.
