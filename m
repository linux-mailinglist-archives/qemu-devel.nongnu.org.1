Indeed, but the whole point is that the bindings wrap unsafe code in
such a way that the safety invariants hold. Not doing this, especially
for a device that does not do DMA (so that there are very few ways
that things can go wrong in the first place), runs counter to the
whole philosophy of Rust.

For example, you have:

    pub fn realize(&mut self) {
        unsafe {
            qemu_chr_fe_set_handlers(
                addr_of_mut!(self.char_backend),
                Some(pl011_can_receive),
                Some(pl011_receive),
                Some(pl011_event),
                None,
                addr_of_mut!(*self).cast::<c_void>(),
                core::ptr::null_mut(),
                true,
            );
        }
    }

where you are implicitly relying on the fact that pl011_can_receive(),
pl011_receive(), pl011_event() are never called from the
MemoryRegionOps read() and write() callbacks. Otherwise you'd have two
mutable references at the same time, one as an argument to the
callbacks:

   pub fn read(&mut self, offset: hwaddr, ...

and one from e.g. "state.as_mut().put_fifo()" in pl011_receive().

This is not Rust code. It makes no attempt at enforcing the whole
"shared XOR mutable" which is the basis of Rust's reference semantics.
In other words, this is as safe as C code---sure, it can use nice
abstractions for register access, it has "unsafe" added in front of
pointer dereferences, but it is not safe.

Again, I'm not saying it's a bad first step. It's *awesome* if we
treat it as what it is: a guide towards providing safe bindings
between Rust and C (which often implies them being idiomatic). But if
we don't accept this, if there is no plan to make the code safe, it is
a potential huge source of technical debt.

The same can be said of C code, can't it? There is nothing unsafe in C
code, assuming there are no bugs...
