git log --since=2022 and then squinted at it. I wrote a warning to take
this with a grain of salt, but it missed the final version.

Mostly caught by a cleanup from Markus. Silly stuff like of mixed signed
integer comparisons and bugs in error handling. I don't even want to
look too much at it.

...hopefully this release we'll manage to resolve that situation.

Not really, but I won't object if you want to add some more in there. To
be honest, I want to get out of people's way as much as I can because
having to revisit this every couple of months is stressful to me.

My rationale for those is:

"/precopy/tcp/plain":
 Smoke test, the most common migration

"/precopy/tcp/tls/psk/match":
 Something might change in the distro regarding tls. Such as:
 https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/1937

"/postcopy/plain":
 Smoke test for postcopy

"/postcopy/preempt/plain":
 Just to exercise the preempt thread

"/postcopy/preempt/recovery/plain":
 Recovery has had some issues with races in the past

"/multifd/tcp/plain/cancel":
 The MVP of catching concurrency issues

"/multifd/tcp/uri/plain/none":
 Smoke test for multifd

All in all, these will test basic funcionality and run very often. The
more tests we add to this set, the less return we get in relation to the
time they take.

I'm not aware of anything. I believe the last arm64 bug we had was the
threadinfo stuff[1]. If you remember what it's about, let me know.

We won't stop running the full set of tests. We can run them in our
forks' CI as much as we want. There are no cases of people reporting a
migration bug because their 'make check' caught something that ours
didn't.

Besides, the main strength of CI is to catch bugs when someone makes a
code change. If people touch migration code, then we'll run it in our CI
anyway. If they touch device code and that device is migrated by default
then any one of the simple tests will catch the issue when it runs via
the migration-compat job. If the device is not enabled by default, then
no tests will catch it.

The worst case scenario is they touch some code completely unrelated and
their 'make check' or CI run breaks because of some race in the
migration code. That's not what CI is for, that's just an annoyance for
everyone. I'd rather it breaks in our hands and then we'll go fix it.

Agreed. I'll send a patch once I get out from under downstream stuff.
