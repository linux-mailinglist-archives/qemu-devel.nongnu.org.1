With SEV-SNP I don't see the point in using this.

Why do you use confidential computing in the first place if you trust
the host with your EFI variables?  I'd rather see something simliar
running under guest control, in svsm context.

On the host side you have no insight into this indeed.

The firmware knows all this very well though.  The OS passes a mapping
table to the firmware, efi runtime drivers can subscribe to mapping
updates and can use RT->ConvertPointer to translate addresses from
physical to virtual.

The edk2 code (https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/pull/10695) does
exactly that.

I see your driver does that too, so in theory it should work just fine.
I'm wondering what exactly the problem with macOS is?

Well, the variable service /is/ completely in qemu.  See patch #6 which
implements getvariable & friends.  edk2 serializes the variable calls
into a buffer and sends them over to the SMM side (or to qemu with the
patches).

I didn't feel like inventing a new serialization protocol if we already
have a proven one in the edk2 code base.  Also it is possible to send
over more than just the variable call.  There is a variable policy
protocol implementation (patch #8), and we also get some events
forwarded.  More can easily be added should the need for that arise.

It would be nice to have nitro support merged upstream,
especially with BYOF coming.

take care,
  Gerd
