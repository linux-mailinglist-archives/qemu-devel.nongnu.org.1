Sorry I was busy in the last couple of weeks, didn't get a chance to 
reply. I thought I got this answered in the last sync call, and here 
just to get a recap back on list. I think the core point is not about 
supporting those various future edge case, but that the HVA tree itself 
is problematic in identifying the exact memory object (right now it 
could easily track the wrong IOVA address and we have to maintain a lot 
of duplicative code like permission checks in SVQ layer) and also hard 
for future optimization (imagine how hard it would be to build a reverse 
tree for exact HVA->IOVA fast translation). And as you know, this is 
just an RFC series and we knew the qemu_ram_block_from_host call in the 
SVQ translation path can't be any performant, but the key motivation was 
to drive to using the decoupled GPA tree against the full HVA tree. 
There could be further optimizations in the virtio queue upper layer to 
percolate the needed information down to the SVQ, such as GPA, or offset 
in MemoryRegionSection, or offset in the ramblock, such that it works in 
a natural way that can to work directly *with* the memory system APIs 
rather than build a HVA tree that has to work *around* various 
limitations and has to track or synchronize with the life cycle of 
different objects (change on guess physical address, memory region, etc) 
in the memory subsystem. Theoretically this way we could work with the 
lower level object e.g. MemoryRegionSection or RAMBlock, though I don't 
think that the need is imminent so I guess GPA is sufficient between the 
virtio device layer and SVQ without the loss in translation (to HVA, as 
the aliasing/overlapping case shows). With the abstraction and use of 
GPA in SVQ, we just have to take care of the various memory listener 
events without having to synchronize a lot of other changes in the 
memory system. On the other hand, it won't have to do extra check on 
permission, or having to sync with the vIOMMU address translation path 
as exposed by the HVA tree solution.

I think one of the immediate step Jonah can make is to make the 
virtqueue_map_desc() API return the real GPA in addition to HVA (current 
code return bus address but this could be GIOVA if virtio device behind 
a vIOMMU), so we can get rid of the qemu_ram_block_from_host API from 
the translation path. This could even work when we have vIOMMU support 
added to SVQ, you can see that within the virtqueue_map_desc() the 
vIOMMU .translate() is naturally done only in the hot datapath without 
having to do translation twice in SVQ again (which I don't see how the 
full HVA tree can get translation efficiently done when working with the 
vIOMMU). Though at earlier point I thought the qemu_ram_block_from_host 
() would be easier for Jonah to pick up and get the key notion of it 
without going too many details immediately, that's why I had to get your 
confirmation it'd be okay for Jonah to go with using the 
qemu_ram_block_from_host API as RFC.
