After a bit more thinking, I leaning towards keeping backend-transfer. I think
it's more meaningful for the user:

If we call it "fd-passing", user may ask:

Ok, what is it? Allow QEMU to pass some fds through migration stream, if it
supports fds? Which fds? Why to pass them? Finally, why QEMU can't just check
is it unix socket or not, and pass any fds it wants if it is?

Logical question is, why not just drop the global capability, and check only
is it unix socket or not? (OK, relying only on socket type is wrong anyway,
as it may be some complex tunneling, which includes unix sockets, but still
can't pass fds, but I think now about feature naming)

But we really want an explicit switch for the feature. As qemu-update is
not the only case of local migration. The another case is changing the
backend. So for the user's choice is:

1. Remote migration: we can't reuse backends (files, sockets, host devices), as
we are moving to another host. So, we don't enable "backend-transfer". We don't
transfer the backend, we have to initialize new backend on another host.

2. Local migration to update QEMU, with minimal freeze-time and minimal
extra actions: use "backend-transfer", exactly to keep the backends
(vhost-user-server, TAP device in kernel, in-kernel vfio device state, etc)
as is.

3. Local migration, but we want to reconfigure some backend, or switch
to another backend. We disable "backend-transfer" for one device.

4. Some problem with "backend-transfer", may be some bug. Disable the whole
beackend-transfer feature, and do normal local migration to a new version
with bug fixed.

-

"backend-transfer" better reflects, what management layer should do, or
should not do with backends, depending on migration type.
