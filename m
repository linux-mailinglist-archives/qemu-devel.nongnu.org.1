Thanks for being open to experiments. I'm not trying to attack you here,
but to not ignore any community concerns as yours. While you have a deep
knowledge of QEMU internals you also try to keep it simple for new devs,
and we really want to keep the project attractive enough to new people.

I hope a declarative HW modelling language will simplify the current
situation, so developers would focus on HW modelling rather than C
implementations and their bugs. Users would focus on the (simple) DSL
and not the C API. To get there we need to start somewhere...
