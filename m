I'd suggest we aim for a world where the commands take all options
as direct args and try to remove the global state eventually.

For savevm/loadvm in particular it is very much a foot-gun that
'migrate-set-*' will affect them, because savevm/loadvm aren't
obviously connected to 'migrate-*' commands unless you're aware
of how QEMU implements savevm internally.

I'm not sure I understand why the QAPI design changes are tied
to the new protocol handshake ? I guess you're wanting to avoid
updating 'migrate_incoming' to accept the new parameters directly ?
