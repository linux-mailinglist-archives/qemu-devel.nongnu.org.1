This is true.

We need numbers, and that's also what I was requesting.  Per my
understanding this is not yet compared, so IMHO we shouldn't state that
before we have some test results.

Note that I'm not NIC provider, I don't sell cards, I don't earn anything
out of it.  However I want to make sure commit messages are true and fair
when I review a patch.  It also matters when I want to provide more
information to future QEMU users to not misguide on how they should see
RDMA under any doc of migration section.  IMHO we can continue the
discussion in the other thread to finish it, rather than rushing on a
MAINTAINERS file update; nobody is going to remove the code without
finishing the discussion so no worry.

Besides, there's also what Dan used to ask on the possibility of wrapping
RDMA channels with QIOChannels.  I thought it won't easily work, but again
definitely be nice if you can help to double check with your RDMA expertises.

So I suppose this patch is not yet ready for merge, either we need to wait
for a true test results coming, or we just need some refinement on the
statements.

I hope I'm not asking too much here, but would you mind also provide a RDMA
documentation patch too?  It's under docs/migration/ currently, and now any
new feature is required to have such for migration:

https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/devel/migration/features.html

RDMA is not a new one, but if we want to keep it, let's make it serious.
IMHO it'll be nice to provide suggestions to user on when an user should
consider using RDMA migrations, or if it's only in maintenance stage we can
also mention there so we suggest people stick with TCP.  Basically we have
a place to provide a summary of all our discussions, so somehow we can
consolidate such discussion there.

Last important thing: you may want to copy Fabiano, he's going to take
whatever patch coming for 9.1.

Thanks,
