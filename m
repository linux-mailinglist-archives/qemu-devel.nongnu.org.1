The reason for introducing x-channel-header was to avoid having to deduce
the channel type by peeking in the channel's content - where any channel
that does not start with QEMU_VM_FILE_MAGIC is currently treated as a
multifd one.

But if this isn't desired then, as you say, the multifd channel type can
be indicated by using some unused field of the MultiFDInit_t message.

Of course, this would still keep the QEMU_VM_FILE_MAGIC heuristic then.

The reason for having dedicated device state channels is that they
provide lower downtime in my tests.

With either 15 or 11 mixed multifd channels (no dedicated device state
channels) I get a downtime of about 1250 msec.

Comparing that with 15 total multifd channels / 4 dedicated device
state channels that give downtime of about 1100 ms it means that using
dedicated channels gets about 14% downtime improvement.

Yeah, that's what MULTIFD_FLAG_DEVICE_STATE in packet header already
does in this patch set - it indicates that the packet contains device
state, not RAM data.
