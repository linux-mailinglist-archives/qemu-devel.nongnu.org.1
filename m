One way to omit ROM per machine could be like in this patch:

https://patchew.org/QEMU/cover.1672868854.git.balaton@eik.bme.hu/e8d6aa41eeb0461d285fa4c12e0fff05d366e8fa.1672868854.git.balaton@eik.bme.hu/

maybe this could also work per device if the romfile property can be set 
from realize or reset method but would need to distinguish between default 
value or user provided value to not override the latter.

There are also some PPC machines that have BIOS emulator in firmware and 
would need the ROM to init the device but these have problems with QEMU's 
gcc compiled ROMs that contain i386 opcodes and can't run these.

Also ati-vga has some tables in the card ROM about timings that drivers 
read even if the machine did not run the ROM and there are Mac versions of 
cards with different ROMs so this may be something dependent on each 
device rather than machine architecture. We can say that devices that QEMU 
emulate are primarily PC cards so they come with a PC option ROM.
