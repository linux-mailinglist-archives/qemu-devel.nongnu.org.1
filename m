Thanks for the extensive follow up here. I was hoping there would be
some way to move more of the logic into all vhost-user generic code
both to help other backends support local migration more easily and
have fewer "if backend is doing a local migration" checks in
vhost-user-blk code. As a straw man design, I would think there could
be some way of having the backend coordinate a handoff by signaling
the source Qemu and then the source Qemu could stop the device and ACK
with a message before the destination Qemu is allowed to start the
device.

Anyways, it seems like other maintainers have blessed this approach so
I'll leave it at that.
