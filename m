Yeah actually that's a big debate for not much. From an implementation
pov that shall not change much. The only doubt I have is if we need to
conditionnaly expose the MSI RESV regions it is easier to do if we
detect we have a smmuv3-accel. what the option allows is the auto mode.

I think we all agree we don't want that use case in general. However
effectively I was questioning why it couldn't work maybe at the expense
of some perf degration.

I am still confused about that. For instance if the guest sends an
NH_ASID, NH_VA invalidation and it happens both the emulated device and
VFIO-device share the same cd.asid (same guest iommu domain, which
practically should not happen) why shouldn't we propagate the
invalidation to the host. Does the problem come from the usage of vCMDQ
or would you foresee the same problem with a generic physical SMMU?
