I just meant it requires me writing less code.

That is true for almost any kind of files, and QEMU provides options to 
specify files with file descriptor for this reason. However, it also 
provides alternative options to specify files with e.g., path for 
convenience.

This patch does not add a entirely-new complex, high-level feature. It 
only pushes the macvtap/ipvtap support to the same level with tuntap and 
other features interacting with files.
