The key thing for me is that in this case (when coroutine yielded), nbd_server_tls_handshake() would finally be called from glib IO handler, set in

    qio_channel_tls_handshake()
       qio_channel_tls_handshake_task()
          qio_channel_add_watch_full()
             g_source_set_callback(source, (GSourceFunc)func, user_data, notify);   <<<

, which would definitely not be a coroutine context.


Do I understand correctly, that "coroutine_fn" means "only call from coroutine context"[1], or does it mean "could be called from coroutine context"[2]?

The comment in osdep.h says:

  * Mark a function that executes in coroutine context                                                     |}
  *                                                                                                        |
  * Functions that execute in coroutine context cannot be called directly from                             |
  * normal functions. ...

So I assume, we mean [1].
