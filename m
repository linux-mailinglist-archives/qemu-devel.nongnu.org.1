Semantics are clear enough to me.

"Conditional special feature" combines "conditional feature" (which is a
special case of conditional thing) with special feature (which is a
special case of feature).

The QAPI schema language supports compile-time conditionals for certain
things.  Generated code behaves as if the thing didn't exist unless its
condition is true.

QAPI schema features are strings exposed to clients in introspection.

Combine the two: a conditional feature is exposed if and only if its
condition is true.

Existing uses: dynamic-auto-read-only if CONFIG_POSIX, fdset if
CONFIG_BLKIO_VHOST_VDPA_FD.

A special feature is a feature that has special meaning to the
generator, i.e. we generate different code in places when it's present.

Combine: we enable different code for a conditional special feature only
when its condition is true.

No existing uses so far.

Implementation is straightforward, too.

Any code we generate for a conditional thing is guarded by #if
... #endif.

For features, we generate suitable data into qapi-introspect.c.

For special features, we generate a little additional code here and
there; look for .is_special() to find it.

Bug: this additional code lacks #if ... #endif.  Simple oversight,
should be easy enough to fix.

I think we should first make a reasonable effort at figuring out how to
handle conditional special features.  If we fail, we can add the
restriction instead.

How do you handle features in general, and special features in
particular?

How do you handle conditionals in general?

How do you combine feature and conditional?

How could you combine special feature and conditonal?
