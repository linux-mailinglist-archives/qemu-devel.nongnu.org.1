I'm getting lost where this is going but keeping AudioState for the QOM 
type seems better than using another name just to try to be consistent 
with char backends that was said to have a confusing naming above. So 
maybe keep the QOM convention for audio and call it AudioState and later 
try to match Char to this if that needs similar QOM'ification? If this is 
replacing QEMUSoundCard then maybe AudioCard can also be considered for 
keeping consistency with local names. But I don't know what I'm talking 
about so I stop here and let you agree on something.
