Thank you for your efforts at making the interfaces cleaner, simpler,
and less redundant.

block-job-pause's doc comment:

    # The operation will pause as soon as possible.  No event is emitted
    # when the operation is actually paused.  [...]

job-pause's:

    # The job will pause as soon as possible, which means transitioning
    # into the PAUSED state if it was RUNNING, or into STANDBY if it was
    # READY.  The corresponding JOB_STATUS_CHANGE event will be emitted.

Either one of them is incorrect about event emission, or there is
another difference.

block-job-resume's doc comment:

    # This command also clears the error status of the job.

Nothing like that job-resume's.  Either one of them is incorrect /
incomplete about the error status clearance, or there is another
difference.

block-job-complete's doc comment:

    # Manually trigger completion of an active background block operation.
    # This is supported for drive mirroring, where it also switches the
    # device to write to the target path only.  The ability to complete is
    # signaled with a BLOCK_JOB_READY event.
    #
    # This command completes an active background block operation
    # synchronously.  The ordering of this command's return with the
    # BLOCK_JOB_COMPLETED event is not defined.  Note that if an I/O error
    # occurs during the processing of this command: 1) the command itself
    # will fail; 2) the error will be processed according to the
    # rerror/werror arguments that were specified when starting the
    # operation.

job-complete's:

    # Manually trigger completion of an active job in the READY state.

Is the latter lacking useful information?

block-job-dismiss's doc comment:

    # For jobs that have already concluded, remove them from the
    # block-job-query list.  This command only needs to be run for jobs
    # which were started with QEMU 2.12+ job lifetime management
    # semantics.

I figure "started with QEMU 2.12+ job lifetime management semantics" is
an awkward way to say "auto-dismiss is false".

job-dismiss's doc comment:

    # Deletes a job that is in the CONCLUDED state.  This command only
    # needs to be run explicitly for jobs that don't have automatic
    # dismiss enabled.

@auto-dismiss defaults to true for jobs that support controlling it:
drive-backup, blockdev-backup, block-commit, drive-mirror,
blockdev-mirror, block-stream.  I guess these are exactly the commands
that already existed when we added "QEMU 2.12+ lifetime management".

I figure it's always false for the other jobs, but that doesn't seem to
be documented anywhere.

block-job-finalize's doc comment:

    # Once a job that has manual=true reaches the pending state, it can be
    # instructed to finalize any graph changes and do any necessary
    # cleanup via this command.  [...]

There is no member @manual anywhere in the QAPI schema.  I figure this
should be @auto-finalize.

job-finalize's doc comment:

    # Instructs all jobs in a transaction (or a single job if it is not
    # part of any transaction) to finalize any graph changes and do any
    # necessary cleanup.  This command requires that all involved jobs are
    # in the PENDING state.

Nothing on @auto-finalize.

@auto-finalize defaults to true for jobs that support controlling it.
These are exactly the ones that support @auto-dismiss.

I figure @auto-dismiss is always false for the other jobs, but that
doesn't seem to be documented anywhere.

The only other bits related to @auto-dismiss and @auto-finalize seem to
be two states in JobStatus:

    # @pending: The job has finished its work, but has finalization steps
    #     that it needs to make prior to completing.  These changes will
    #     require manual intervention via @job-finalize if auto-finalize
    #     was set to false.  These pending changes may still fail.
    [...]
    # @concluded: The job has finished all work.  If auto-dismiss was set
    #     to false, the job will remain in the query list until it is
    #     dismissed via @job-dismiss.


Is it possible to observe @concluded via QMP when @auto-dismiss is on?

What about @pending?

Aside: getting rid of auto-dismiss and auto-finalize some day would be
nice.
