Hello Peter Xu,

thanks for pointing to your series. What I like about it is that it 
removes the limit of a single bounce buffer per AddressSpace.

Unfortunately it does not solve my problem. You limit the sum of all of 
the allocations for a single AddressSpcace to 
DEFAULT_MAX_BOUNCE_BUFFER_SIZE = 4096 which is too small for my use case.

Why do we need a limit?
Why is it so tiny?

Best regards

Heinrich
