On that theme, we also already accept adhoc donations from individuals
but have never made this very obvious, instead hiding the paypal link.

Now that we have a clear desire to try to fund our own project services
more directly, we should be more open to receiving adhoc donations from
individuals too.

We don't need to aggressively nag people, but there's little harm in
having a link to donations more prominently featured IMHO. Thus I
created a qemu-web proposal to put a donations link in the nav bar of
the front page:

   https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu-web/-/merge_requests/7

With regards,
Daniel
