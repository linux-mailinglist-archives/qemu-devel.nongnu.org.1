I am not aware of any such event on the destination side. When postcopy
(and its switchower) starts, the destination transitions from ACTIVE
directly to POSTCOPY_ACTIVE in the listen thread while devices are
loaded concurrently by the main thread.

There is DEVICE state on the source side, but that is used only on the
source side when device state is being collected. When device state is
being loaded on the destination, the source side is also already in
POSTCOPY_ACTIVE state.
