The 'file:' protocol eventually calls into qemu_open, and this
transparently allows for FD passing using /dev/fdset/NNN syntax
to pass in FDs.

Adding 'fd' here is not desirable, because 'filename' is
resolved via qemu_open which allows for FD passing without
introducing any new syntax in interfaces which take filenames.
