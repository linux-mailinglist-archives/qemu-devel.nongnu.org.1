A comment in the code is better.

A description of the current version of the code should be left as a 
comment so that readers can find it without git blame.

The commit message is suited for a description of the old version of 
code (e.g., a bug fixed by the commit) or a comparison between the old 
and new version; leaving them as comments will infinitely increase the 
amount of the code.

In this case, it is about a problem with the current version so it 
should be written as a comment.

It is better to describe the estimation of the risk in the comment too.
