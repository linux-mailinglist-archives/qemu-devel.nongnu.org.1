You may precise this stage-1 normal HWPT is used to map GPA to HPA (so
eventually implements stage 2).

yes S1+S2 are combined through vfio_iommu_map_notify()

See
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20210411120912.15770-16-eric.auger@redhat.com/
and vfio_prereg_listener()
Again I do not say this is the right way to do but using system address
space is not the "only" implementation choice I think and it needs to be
properly justified, especially has it has at least 2 side effects:
- somehow abusing the semantic of returned address space and pretends
there is no IOMMU translation in place and
- also impacting the way MSIs are handled (introduction of a new
PCIIOMMUOps).
This kind of explanation you wrote is absolutely needed in the commit
msg for reviewers to understand the design choice I think.
