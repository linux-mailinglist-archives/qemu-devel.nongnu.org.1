I guess I'm wondering why we should consider this a bug in QEMU
rather than a bug in either the toolkit or host rendering stack ?

Lets say there was no guest OS here, just a regular host app
issuing drawing requests that were equivalent to the workload
the guest is issuing.  If that applications' execution got
blocked because its drawing requests are not getting processed
when iconified, I'd be inclined to call it a bug.

Or are we perhaps handling drawing in the wrong way in QEMU ?

If the problem is with drawing to a iconified windows, is
there an intermediate target buffer we should be drawing
to, instead of directly to the window. There must be some
supported way to have drawing requests fully processed in
the background indepent of having a visible window, surely ?

With regards,
Daniel
