Heh, that's not a question you want to be asking.  You're effectively askin=
g me
to make an authorative, "final" decision on a topic which I am only passing=
ly
familiar with.

But since you asked it... :-)  Probably?

I see a lot of advantages to a VTL/VSM-like approach:

 1. Provides Linux-as-a guest the flexibility it needs to meaningfully adva=
nce
    its security, with the least amount of policy built into the guest/host=
 ABI.

 2. Largely decouples guest policy from the host, i.e. should allow the gue=
st to
    evolve/update it's policy without needing to coordinate changes with th=
e host.

 3. The KVM implementation can be generic enough to be reusable for other f=
eatures.

 4. Other groups are already working on VTL-like support in KVM, e.g. for V=
SM
    itself, and potentially for VMPL/SVSM support.

IMO, #2 is a *huge* selling point.  Not having to coordinate changes across
multiple code bases and/or organizations and/or maintainers is a big win fo=
r
velocity, long term maintenance, and probably the very viability of HEKI.

Providing the guest with the tools to define and implement its own policy m=
eans
end users don't have to way for some third party, e.g. CSPs, to deploy the
accompanying host-side changes, because there are no host-side changes.

And encapsulating everything in the guest drastically reduces the friction =
with
changes in the kernel that interact with hardening, both from a technical a=
nd a
social perspective.  I.e. giving the kernel (near) complete control over it=
s
destiny minimizes the number of moving parts, and will be far, far easier t=
o sell
to maintainers.  I would expect maintainers to react much more favorably to=
 being
handed tools to harden the kernel, as opposed to being presented a set of A=
PIs
that can be used to make the kernel compliant with _someone else's_ vision =
of
what kernel hardening should look like.

E.g. imagine a new feature comes along that requires overriding CR0/CR4 pin=
ning
in a way that doesn't fit into existing policy.  If the VMM is involved in
defining/enforcing the CR pinning policy, then supporting said new feature =
would
require new guest/host ABI and an updated host VMM in order to make the new
feature compatible with HEKI.  Inevitably, even if everything goes smoothly=
 from
an upstreaming perspective, that will result in guests that have to choose =
between
HEKI and new feature X, because there is zero chance that all hosts that ru=
n Linux
as a guest will be updated in advance of new feature X being deployed.

And if/when things don't go smoothly, odds are very good that kernel mainta=
iners
will eventually tire of having to coordinate and negotiate with QEMU and ot=
her
VMMs, and will become resistant to continuing to support/extend HEKI.

> If yes, that would indeed require a *lot* of work for something we're not
> sure will be accepted later on.

Yes and no.  The AWS folks are pursuing VSM support in KVM+QEMU, and SVSM s=
upport
is trending toward the paired VM+vCPU model.  IMO, it's entirely feasible t=
o
design KVM support such that much of the development load can be shared bet=
ween
the projects.  And having 2+ use cases for a feature (set) makes it _much_ =
more
likely that the feature(s) will be accepted.

And similar to what Paolo said regarding HEKI not having a complete story, =
I
don't see a clear line of sight for landing host-defined policy enforcement=
, as
there are many open, non-trivial questions that need answers. I.e. upstream=
ing
HEKI in its current form is also far from a done deal, and isn't guaranteed=
 to
be substantially less work when all is said and done.
