Is this because cpr can fail some ramblock in qemu_ram_is_named_file()?

It's not obvious in this case, maybe some re-strcture would be nice.  Would
something like this look nicer and easier to understand?

Please feel free to squash this to your patch in whatever way if it looks
reasonable to you.
