The main purpose of this patch is not to make the memory-region tree 
output easier for programs to parse.

Instead, it's to make the output clearer when there are many memory 
regions in the machine.

Right now, we use spaces for indentation, which makes it hard to see the 
hierarchy clearly — I want similar to how the tree command works.

During discussions with multiple threads, we also looked into more 
details, like avoiding the use of special characters.
