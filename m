Excellent!

I'm focused on the TCG and physmem fixes right now, but would like to do
a detailed review of your new version later this week.

We have a few more weeks - probably want a final version to be on list by
end of this month - so there is a bit of time before the soft feature freeze
on the 12th March https://wiki.qemu.org/Planning/9.0

Those 2 series our now upstream :)

All sound good. I'll not attempt to review in the git tree  - I've gotten far
too used to email flows for review but I should be able to get on it fairly
quickly once posted.

I guess that will hit the TCG bugs/missing features if we end up with page tables
in it.  Should have same problems as for non DC regions.

Review feedback has been helpful on the TCG changes so they should be in 9.0 I think.
Will go via different paths to the CXL support however so no idea when they'll be
in relative to DC support.

Thanks,

Jonathan
