As described in PATCH 1/7, without issuing KVM_PMU_CAP_DISABLE, KVM has
no way to know that userspace does not intend to enable vPMU in AMD
platforms, and therefore does not fault guest accesses to PMU MSRs.

My understanding is that the issue being addressed here is basically the
opposite: QEMU does not know that vPMU is disabled by KVM.

IIUC, one difference between Intel and AMD is that AMD lacks a CPUID
leaf to indicate the availability of PMU version 1. But Intel
potentially could be in the same situation that KVM advertises PMU
availability but it's not actually supported. (e.g. kvm->arch.enable_pmu
is false while modules parameter enable_pmu is true).

From the guest’s point of view, it probes PMU MSRs to determine whether
PMU support is present and it's fine in this situation.

In userspace, QEMU may issue KVM_SET_MSRS / KVM_GET_MSRS to KVM without
knowing that vPMU has been disabled by KVM.  I think these IOCTLs should
not fail, since KVM states that “Userspace is allowed to read MSRs, and
write ‘0’ to MSRs, that KVM advertises to userspace, even if an MSR
isn’t fully supported.”

My current understanding is that AMD should be fine even without
kvm_pmu_disabled, but I may be missing some context here.

The bottom line is this patch doesn't handle the cases that KVM still
could disable vPMU support even if enable_pmu is true.

I guess this might make things more complicated.

Apologies for the incorrect statement I made earlier regarding mediated
vPMU.

According to the mediated vPMU v6, the only behavior specific to
mediated vPMU is that kvm->arch.enable_pmu may be cleared when
irqchip_in_kernel() is not true:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20251206001720.468579-17-seanjc@google.com/

However, this does not imply that mediated vPMU requires any special
handling here. In theory, KVM could clear kvm->arch.enable_pmu in the
future for other reasons.
