I wonder if any of this is worth the pain in practice.....


Looking at the QAPI schema, we apply TARGET_xxxx conditions either to
commands, or to structs/enums that are used in args/return of commands.
We don't conditionalize individual fields, etc.

I tried to query our schema with 'jq' (incidentally rather tedious
because of our JSON-but-not-JSON language[1]). If I select only
commands we get:

query-cpu-definitions          => currently many arches
query-cpu-model-expansion      => currently many arches
query-cpu-model-baseline       => currently s390x only
query-cpu-model-comparison     => currently s390x only
query-s390x-cpu-polarization   => inherently s390x only
query-gic-capabilities         => inherently arm only
query-sev                      => inherently x86 only
query-sev-attestation-report   => inherently x86 only
query-sev-capabilities         => inherently x86 only
query-sev-launch-measure       => inherently x86 only
query-sgx                      => inherently x86 only
query-sgx-capabilities         => inherently x86 only
rtc-reset-reinjection          => inherently x86 only
set-cpu-topology               => inherently s390x only
sev-inject-launch-secret       => inherently x86 only
xen-event-inject               => currently x86 only
xen-event-list                 => currently x86 only

The two Xen commands are currently limited to x86, but if we ever extended
Xen to arm, possibly they would make sense. IOW, conceptually a target
conditional might be useful in future.

The CPU model commands are the ones where having the target conditions
visible in schema appears to add value, in that they'll allow a mgmt
app to detect when we extend any of them to cover new architectures.


Libvirt (and other mgmt apps) want to query the schema to see if commands
exist in the QEMU they're using, before trying to invoke them. To some
degree this is just a "nice to have" that improves error reporting/detection.


For the commands that are inherently arch specific, the mgmt app should
conceptually already know what architectures these commands apply to.
These target conditionals provide little (no) value when probing commands
in the schema.

IOW, if we (for example) have a single binary for x86 and s390, it should
be harmless if we report that 'query-sev' exists regardless of arch, as
the mgmt app should none the less already know to only use it with x86.

I don't know if libvirt correctly filters based on architecture in the
case of SEV/SGX/GIC/RTC when probing & using these features, but if it
does not, then I'd consider that a pre-existing bug that should be fixed.

Libvirt doesn't use the Xen commands.

For query-cpu-model-comparison/baseline, libvirt already filters its
usage of these based on s390 arch, so even if x86 reported them I
believe it won't break libvirt today. If these commands are extended
to other archs in future, libvirt might want a way to detect this.
On the flipside it might not be the end of the world if we just expose
them on all arches and simply have them return an error at runtime
where non-applicable. 


IOW, while the target conditions could theoretically provide value at
some point in future, it does not look like they do anything /today/
for libvirt.

Given that I wonder if we shouldn't just ignore the problem, and
blindly remove all TARGET_nnn conditions from QAPI schema today. Let
our future selves worry about it should this prove insufficient later.


With regards,
Daniel
