To think of it another way....

Signed-off-by is the only tag which has defined legal meaning
in terms of asserting that the people involved have permission
to contribute.

All the other tags (Reviewed/Tested/etc) are merely a historical
record of the development process, and have no legal implications.

This makes Signed-off-by the important one, and the others all
in the "nice to have" category.

With regards,
Daniel
