debug-swap defaulted to true for KVM_SEV*_INIT guests unfortunately, so
the ship sailed on preparing users for the change in advance and instead
over time legacy guests users will gradually see the measurement change
when they upgrade to new kernels and then need to take steps to either
adjust their measurement calculation or disable debug-swap via module
parameters.

debug-swap is fairly recent as well however, so there's a fair chance
users hitting the above issue will have the option of switching over to
KVM_SEV_INIT2 where it's not much additional work to update
measurements, and in turn they'll benefit from better control over what
ends up in the VMSA as well. If they do plan to eventually switch to SNP,
these steps will bring them closer toward that end as well since there's
a lot of common handling/infrastructure in that regard.

In my experience that's how many VMs start off until they start breaking
on newer kernels/QEMUs, then everyone scrambles to revert to the old
behavior. Quite often that ends up involving just tacking on an explicit
machine-type to maintain migration/behavioral compatibility with what
QEMU originally defaulted to when the VM was created.

But when first creating the VM, there is less expectation about what
should/shouldn't work. If they see failures because KVM_SEV_INIT2 isn't
available, it seems worthwhile that they need to make a decision on
whether to upgrade kernel or adopt the legacy behavior and be stuck on
a reduced featureset for the life of the guest. "Just works" is nice,
but "just working" in the case of KVM_SEV*_INIT comes with potential
headaches down the road and ideally users would be aware of what they
are signing up for.

If failing is too heavy-handed, maybe some type of warning that gets
printed by QEMU any time KVM_SEV*_INIT set? Then maybe down the road
if we decide to finally default KVM_SEV_INIT2, there's a better chance
that users have taken the hint and have already made the transiton?

I'll also defer to the maintainers on this point though since there are
clearly merits to both approaches.

Totally agreed on this point. I've sent a patch that does this, and
adopted the QAPI wording you used in this patch so there is less churn
if they are both applied:
