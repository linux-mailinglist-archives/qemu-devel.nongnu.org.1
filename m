I see. Then "MAP_PRIVATE" would be clearer. I wasn't sure whether you
mean mmap flags or something like the memory range is no longer
accessible to the driver.

Okay. The device model needs to create MemoryRegion instances for the
device's Shared Memory Regions and add them to the VirtIODevice.

--device vhost-user-device will need to query the backend since, unlike
vhost-user-gpu-pci and friends, it doesn't have knowledge of specific
device types. It will need to create MemoryRegions enumerated from the
backend.

By the way, the VIRTIO MMIO Transport also supports VIRTIO Shared Memory
Regions so this work should not be tied to PCI.

But then --device vhost-user-device wouldn't be able to support VIRTIO
Shared Memory Regions, which means this patch series is incomplete. New
vhost-user features need to support both --device vhost-user-<type>-*
and --device vhost-user-device.

What's needed is:
1. New vhost-user messages so the frontend can query the shmids and
   sizes from the backend.
2. QEMU --device vhost-user-device code that queries the VIRTIO Shared
   Memory Regions from the vhost-user backend and then creates
   MemoryRegions for them.

You can reproduce this with two virtiofs devices. Where device A has the
DAX Window feature enabled. The test program mmaps the DAX file and then
opens a new file on device B and performs an O_DIRECT write(2) syscall.

I think that this issue must be address in this series since this issue
is introduced by enabling VIRTIO Shared Memory Regions in vhost-user.

A bit more detail:

Device A has a VIRTIO Shared Memory Region. An application mmaps that
memory (examples: guest userspace driver using Linux VFIO, a guest
kernel driver that exposes the memory to userspace via mmap, or guest
kernel DAX). The application passes that memory as an I/O buffer to
device B (e.g. O_DIRECT disk I/O).

The result is that device B's vhost-user backend receives a vring
descriptor that points to a guest memory address in device A's VIRTIO
Shared Memory Region. Since device B does not have this memory in its
table, it cannot translate the address and the device breaks.

I think it's fine to start with the stricter model where no overlapping
mappings are allowed. If someone needs overlapping mappings in the
future, a feature bit could be added to negotiate support.

Please document that overlapping mappings are not supported.

Yes, I think the current interface is safe, too.

"vhost-user driver" is not a term that's used, as far as I know. The
vhost-user spec calls it the front-end (older code and docs may call it
the vhost-user master).

> And then here we would keep QEMU or use VMM instead?

The vhost-user spec uses both front-end and QEMU to mean the same thing.
VMM is not used in the vhost-user spec. I suggest using front-end in new
spec text because QEMU is not the only application that implements this
spec anymore.

That sounds good. I'm not aware of any use cases that require anything fanc=
