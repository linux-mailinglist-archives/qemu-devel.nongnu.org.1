I don't know enough about Rust/serde to give advice.  I do know how to
make a fool of myself by asking dumb questions.

Are you talking about commands implemented in Rust?

The existing data flow is roughly like this (I'm simplifying):

1. Parse JSON text into request QObject, pass to QMP core

2. Extract command name string and argument QDict

3. Look up generated command marshaller / unmarshaller, pass argument
   QDict to it

4. Unmarshall argument QDict with the QObject input visitor and
   generated visit_type_ARG()

5. Pass the C arguments to the handwritten command handler, receive the
   C return value

6. Marshall the return value into a QObject with the QObject output
   visitor and generated visit_type_RET(), return it to QMP core

7. Insert it into a response QObject

8. Unparse response QObject into JSON text

How would a Serde flow look like?

object_property_set() takes the new property value wrapped in an input
visitor.  The property setter extracts it using visit_type_FOOs() with
this input visitor as it sees fit.  Ideally, it uses exactly
visit_type_PROPTYPE().

object_property_get() takes an output visitor to be wrapped it around
the property value.  The property getter inserts it using
visit_type_FOOs() with this output visitor as it sees fit.  Ideally, it
uses exactly visit_type_PROPTYPE().

We sometimes use a QObject input / output visitor, and sometimes a
string input / output visitor.  The latter come with restrictions, and
are evolutionary dead ends.

The QObject visitors wrap a QObject, the string visitors wrap a string
(d'oh).

I'm afraid this is too terse for ignorant me.
