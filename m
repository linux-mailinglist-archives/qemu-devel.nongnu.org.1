Yes, exactly.

For ref cores, it's easier to pick the ones that actually matter for a
specific use case, for arch exts I don't think we can avoid implementing
those we don't really care about. And yes, from the sample of cpus I've
looked at they seem to be much closer to a ref core than to an arch ext.
