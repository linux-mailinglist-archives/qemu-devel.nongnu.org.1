I'm not against the patch itself..

But I still don't understand, how it fixes the bug.

Why segfault happens, which pointer is invalid? And why?

Aha, I start to understand.

1. assume that's exactly the cor_filter_bs (is it? it should be noted here if so)

2. As we know, at this time, it doesn't have any children.

3. But, it (most probably) has bs->implicit = true, as we do set it for cor_filter_bs,
when filter node-name is not given in job parameters. Is it the case?

And finally, in bdrv_refresh_filename(), we have

     if (bs->implicit) {
         /* For implicit nodes, just copy everything from the single child */
         child = QLIST_FIRST(&bs->children);
         assert(QLIST_NEXT(child, next) == NULL);

         pstrcpy(bs->exact_filename, sizeof(bs->exact_filename),
                 child->bs->exact_filename);

which, of course, will not work when we don't have any children.


If my assumptions match, they should be mentioned in commit message.


---

Ok, so, the commit make a work-around: avoid listing the invalid node
in query-named-block-nodes by removing it earlier (after the commit,
the node will be removed on final bdrv_unref() in bdrv_cor_filter_drop().

This doesn't seem safe: what if someone else have another reference on
the filter node? Or will have in future? The bug will raise again.

More correct would be fix the core problem: bdrv_refresh_filename()
crashes for detached implicit filters.

Could you check, will something like this fix the reproducer:

Other ideas:

Maybe, when removing the filter child, we should set its bs->drv to NULL,
as filter node becomes nonfunctional.

Or, set bs->implicit to false, which will activate generic path in
bdrv_refresh_filename (I'm not sure it will work good for the detached
filter node)


---

Hmm, I also think that mentioned
bdc4c4c5e372756a "backup: Remove nodes from job in .clean()" is
at least incomplete.

In block-layer, having reference counters in bs, we can't rely on
"hmm, let's just drop this one reference, and hope, that after next
function, the node will be completely removed".

So, we either need a guarantee, that filter node is completely removed
when we detach it (OK, detaching should just fail if it doesn't lead
to complete removal), or we should be prepared to existing detached
filters, and handle them correctly.
