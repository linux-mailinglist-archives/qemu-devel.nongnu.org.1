Thanks for your time to evaluate and reply. Sorry that I'm not convinced. You're explaining
what we already have in current design and implementation. It doesn't mean the current design
and implementation is 100% perfect and flawless.

In current design and implementation, all (QOM) vCPU objects have to be instantiated, even
though those hotpluggable (QOM) vCPU objects aren't realized at bootup time. After that, those
(QOM) hotpluggable vCPU objects are finalized and destroyed so that they can be hot added
afterwards. This sounds like we create (QOM) vCPU objects, remove those (QOM) vCPU objects
at booting time so that they can be hot-added at running time. The duplicate work is obvious
there. This scheme and design looks just-for-working, not in an optimized way to me.

I'm giving up the efforts to convince you. Lets see if other reviewers will have same concern
or not. Another possibility would be to have current implementation (with all fixes) merged
upstream firstly, and then seek optimizations after that. That time, the suggestion can be
re-evaluated.

Your explanation is not completely correct to me. It's what we had in current design. It
doesn't means the design should have to be like this. The (KVM) vCPU file descriptor must
be in place before QOM GICv3 object is instantiated and realized, but the (QOM) vCPU objects
don't have to exist before that. However, we may need a lot of code changes to tame GICv3Common
and GICv3KVM so that they can be vCPU hot-add/remove friendly and then to avoid the pre-created
(QOM) vCPU objects.

It can be something to be re-evaluated in the future, as I said above. Frankly, It's pointless
to take our time on the discussions without reaching to any conclusions. From my side, I've tried
my best to provide my comments and explain my thoughts. Appreciated for your patience, time on
evaluation, and replies :)

Thanks,
Gavin
