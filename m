No, the new implementation saturates load ports, and Genoa runs 512-bit
AVX instructions at half throughput compared to their 256-bit counterparts
(so one 512-bit load or two 256-bit loads per cycle), so there's no
obvious reason why this patch would sacrifice performance there.

Maybe it could, indirectly, by lowering the turbo clock limit due to
higher front-end activity, but I don't have access to a Zen 4 machine
to check, and even so it would be a few percent, not 2x.
