No possible of such report if the user uses Libvirt or even more virt
stacks, am I right?  While this is only for whoever uses QEMU directly, and
only if the one forgot to remove a leftover image file?

I'd not worry about those people who use QEMU directly - they aren't the
people we need to care too much about, imho (and I'm definitely one of
them..).  The problem is I feel it an overkill introducing a migration
global var just for this purpose.

No strong opinions, if you feel strongly like so I'm ok with it.  But if
one day if we want to remove FileOutgoingArgs I'll also leave that to you
as a trade-off. :-)

Thanks.  And I hope we can also get some more clues too when you dig out
more out of the whole add-fd API; I hope we don't pile up more complicated
logics on top of a mistery.  I feel like this is the time we figure things
out.
