Kind of. vdpa_net requires that the enable calls on the dataplane
vrings are done after DRIVER_OK. So as you say in your mail, we're
good with vhost_dev_start, and changes may be focused to vhost_net.c

Vhost vdpa enable / disable semantics is just different from
vhost-user, the one that originally implemented
.vhost_set_vring_enable. That is the reason why the vhost vDPA enable
was called at vhost_vdpa_dev_start originally.

Vhost-user also calls that function to enable and disable queues. And
the vhost kernel does not even implement the vhost_op, but relies on
vhost_net_set_backend (not sure about other kinds of devices).

This patch is moving toward making them equal, which is not correct.
But maybe it is ok to do that tiny step in that direction to fix
generic vhost-vdpa generic dev and fix that later.

Just for completion, I tried to implement it using the vhost_op but it
was rejected already [1]. It was before Stefano's patch for
selectively disable vrings enable.

Yes I think the same.

Early return should work but I'm not sure if that is the most
sustainable way. We should remove peer->type conditionals as much as
possible :).

To split vhost_ops would be better, yes. But these should be split
between the virtio vring enable vs vhost vring enable. The first one
does not accept a boolean, as it is only one direction. But this
option requires more changes, so I'm happy with the early return for
now. Not sure about Jason or MST.

As a draft for the comment:

Net vhost-vdpa devices need to dataplane virtqueues after DRIVER_OK,
so it can recover device state before starting dataplane. Because of
that, not enabling virtqueues here and leaving it to net/vhost-vdpa.c.
---

And maybe we can add another comment at vhost_dev_start doc? Something
in the line of:
* vring =3D yes means vhost_dev_start will start all vrings. vring =3D
false delegates vring initialization to the caller.

Does that make sense to you?

Thanks!
