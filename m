Why can we not keep the old style register mapping as 'secondary mapping'?

The expectation is that old VM state / CRB state can be used by the new QEMU and
also new QEMU CRB state should be readable by old QEMU. So in a way the old 'secondary'
mmaping has to hold the true value of the registers so that the latter works.
