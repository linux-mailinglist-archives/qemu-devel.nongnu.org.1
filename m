I think we're in violent agreement.  Ignore the last line about Adrian's as=
sertion,
which was very poorly phrased, and the above boils down to:

  The only CPUID bits that truly matter are those that are associated with =
hardware
  features the TDX module allows the guest to use directly, and KVM *must* =
know
  if the bits are fixed0, fixed1, or configurable.

At the end of the day, the list is going to be human-generated.  For the UX=
 side
of things, it makes sense to push that responsibility to the TDX Module, be=
cause
it should be trivially easy to derive from the source code.

But identifying CPUID bits that control features requires human interventio=
n (or
I suppose AI that can cross-reference specs with code).

Again, I think we're in violent agreement.

Oh, yeah, that'd work.  Grab the guest CPUID and then verify that bits KVM =
needs
to be 0 (or 1) are set according, and WARN+kill if there's a mismatch.

Honestly, I'd probably prefer that over using the fixed bit interface, as m=
y gut
says it's less likely for the TDX Module to misreport what CPUID it has cre=
ated
for the guest, than it is for the TDX module to generate a "fixed bits" lis=
t that
doesn't match the code.  E.g. KVM has (had?) more than a few CPUID features=
 that
KVM emulates without actually reporting support to userspace.
