 > Please provide more information how this is supposed to work

We initially discovered that virtio-mem could be used by a malicious
agent to trigger the Rowhammer vulnerability and further achieve a VM
escape.

Simply speaking, Rowhammer is a DRAM vulnerability where frequent access
to a memory location might cause voltage leakage to adjacent locations,
effectively flipping bits in these locations. In other words, with
Rowhammer, an adversary can modify the data stored in the memory.

For a complete attack, an adversary needs to: a) determine which parts
of the memory are prone to bit flips, b) trick the system to store
important data on those parts of memory and c) trigger bit flips to
tamper important data.

Now, for an attacker who only has access to their VM but not to the
hypervisor, one important challenge among the three is b), i.e., to give
back the memory they determine as vulnerable to the hypervisor. This is
where the pitfall for virtio-mem lies: the attacker can modify the
virtio-mem driver in the VM's kernel and unplug memory proactively.

The current impl of virtio-mem in qemu does not check if it is valid for
the VM to unplug memory. Therefore, as is proved by our experiments,
this method works in practice.

 > whether this is a purely theoretical case, and how relevant this is in

In our design, on a host machine equipped with certain Intel processors
and inside a VM that a) has a passed-through PCI device, b) has a vIOMMU
and c) has a virtio-mem device, an attacker can force the EPT to use
pages that are prone to Rowhammer bit flips and thus modify the EPT to
gain read and write privileges to an arbitrary memory location.

Our efforts involved conducting end-to-end attacks on two separate
machines with the Core i3-10100 and the Xeon E2124 processors
respectively, and has achieved successful VM escapes.

virtio-balloon does not work with device passthrough currently, so we
have yet to produce a feasible attack with it.

By "that behavior" do you mean to unplug memory when size <=
requested_size? I am not sure how that is to be implemented.

That is true, but the attacker will want the capability to release a
specific sub-block.

In fact, a sub-block is still somewhat coarse, because most likely there
is only one page in a sub-block that contains potential bit flips. When
the attacker spawns EPTEs, they have to spawn enough to make sure the
target page is used to store the EPTEs.

A 2MB sub-block can store 2MB/4KB*512=262,144 EPTEs, equating to at
least 1GB of memory. In other words, the attack program exhausts 1GB of
memory just for the possibility that KVM uses the target page to store
EPTEs.
