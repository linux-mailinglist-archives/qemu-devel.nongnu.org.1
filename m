Heh, that's understandable and fair. :)

Agreed.  Maybe we can have a list of that in the cover letter or even
QEMU's migration/rmda doc page.

Lei, if you think that makes sense please do so in your upcoming posts.
There'll need to have a list of things you encountered in the kernel driver
and it'll be even better if there're further links to read on each problem.

Oh, that's pretty internal stuff of rdma to me and beyond my knowledge..
but from what I can tell it sounds very reasonable indeed!

Thanks!
