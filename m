Rule of thumb for compilers: every error needs a negative test.  So,
test coverage for transmogrifier errors is certainly wanted, but it's
not a blocker for an initial merge.  We need to make progress, and to
make progress, we need to limit the size of the steps.

Reproduced.  To get non-first warnings, you have to configure
--disable-werror.  Observation, not a complaint.

I'm definitely not asking you to find out more :)

Also reproduced.  Thanks!

Perhaps the patch could be moved closer to where it's needed, or even be
squashed into one the first one that depends it.  Bah, good enough as
is.

Here's my attempt to improve the commit message:

    qapi/parser: adjust info location for doc body section

    Instead of using the info object for the doc block as a whole (which
    always points to the very first line of the block), update the info
    pointer for each call to ensure_untagged_section when the existing
    section is otherwise empty. This way, Sphinx error information will
    match precisely to where the text actually starts.

    For example, this patch will move the info pointer for the "Hello!"
    untagged section ...

        ##       <-- from here ...
        # Hello! <-- ... to here.
        ##

    This doesn't seem to improve error reporting now.  It will with the
    QAPI doc transmogrifier I'm about to add.

    If I stick bad rST into qapi/block-core.json like this

         ##
         # @SnapshotInfo:
         #
        +# rST syntax error: *ahh!
        +#
         # @id: unique snapshot id
         #
         # @name: user chosen name

    the existing code's error message will point to the beginning of the
    doc comment, which is less than helpful.  The transmogrifier's
    message will point to the erroneous line, but to accomplish this, it
    needs this patch.

What do you think?
