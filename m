Yes, a network failure can indeed happen at any time, but that's the
decision we need to make if we can allow the possibility of two machines
running at the same time. And depending on that, one solution is more
complex than the other.

Right now if the network fails during the device load and the
destination reaches 3rd ping and postcopy-run, the machine would start,
but the source wouldn't. So to me, it looks a bit like a regression, if
we introduce a possibility of two machines trying to start.

I can test this idea, but I think it should be working and there should
be no problems if there are no network issues. However, then there's
also a question if we want the destination side to exit gracefully if
there is some issue during device load that doesn't cause immediate
crash. IUUC it would switch to POSTCOPY_PAUSED and then the management
application would need to kill it and restart the migration.

But are migration capabilities limited to machine types?

My understanding is that once VM is migrated to the new QEMU it can
start using the capability even if it uses older machine type. Then we
would be in the same situation, that the feature is usable once we are
migrating from a newer QEMU instance.

So, while yes, such solution would require fewer changes, but to me, it
feels like introducing a known regression if the network would fail
before the destination reaches 3rd ping message while processing the
packaged command. But in case the probability of such failure is so
slim, that it's not worth to have the more complex solution, I can move
on with the simpler one.
