"zero" is a better name than "duplicate".  Identical non-zero pages are
possible, and they are duplicates, too.

If you add @zero with the intent to replace @duplicate, you should
immediately deprecate @duplicate.  If you need assistance with that,
just ask.

This is not at all clear from the documentation of MigrationStats.  I
think the documentation needs improvement there.

Yes, because member @page-size tells them the multiplier.

QMP is for machines.  Machines don't need or want the same quantity in
two units.  Providing them both bytes and pages is a design mistake.
Whether it's worth correcting now is of course debatable.

Regardless, the fact @normal-bytes =3D @normal * @page-size needs to be
documented.  We have

    # @page-size: The number of bytes per page for the various page-based
    #     statistics (since 2.10)

The fact that I inquired how zero-pages and zero-bytes are related might
indicate that this isn't quite clear enough.
