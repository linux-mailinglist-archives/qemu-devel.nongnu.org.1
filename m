I guess it depends on how it's configured, both in hardware
and software. I'm testing on a regular ThinkPad with Ubuntu
and default settings. It's probably possible to configure USB
to turn off power during suspend. In that case, it might
reappear after resume with a new address. However, with
the default settings, it seems to keep the same device node
and address. I assume the driver just switches it to
low-power mode and then back to normal.

In usb_host_auto_check, it reopens the device when the
handle s->dh is NULL. This happens after
usb_host_req_complete_data receives the "no device" status
and closes the device. Maybe one of the kernel functions
returns -ENODEV at some point, but after that, the device
continues to work fine.
