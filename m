Since do_sync_target_write() currently doesn't ignore aligned writes, I
wouldn't change it. Of course they can count towards the "done_bitmap"
you propose below.

Right.

Yes, I'd rather only do that as a last resort.

It could lead to a lot of flips between job->actively_synced == true and
== false. AFAIU, currently, we only switch back from true to false when
an error happens. While I don't see a concrete issue with it, at least
it might be unexpected to users, so it better be documented.

I'll try going with this approach, thanks!
