Ok, so something to possibly look into later, but not for the time
being.

Hm, after looking some more at the code, I agree that it can't have
worked, for the simple reason that sftp_read() never returns SSH_AGAIN,
but turns it into 0. Which QEMU would have reported as an I/O error if
we're not at EOF.

What I don't understand yet where in the code it would have blocked
before rather than returning an error. I tried to follow the code path
and didn't see anything like it, but obviously I'm also not familiar
with libssh code. I guess it also doesn't really matter as long as we
know it has always been broken...

The thing that maybe misled me is that sftp_recv_response_msg() calls
ssh_channel_poll() first to make sure that there is even something to
read. So I expected it should have been non-blocking at least in some
cases, but if it had been, we would probably have seen I/O errors all
the time?

How do you feel about it? Do you think this is something libssh can
support, or is it something that might accidentally work today, but not
necessarily next year?

We have a thread pool readily available that we could use, but then
requests for the same session would come from different threads - just
never at the same time. If we need a single long-lived thread per
session instead, that might be a little more involved because we might
have to implement all the communication and synchronisation from
scratch.

(Hmm... Or we abuse the IOThread object to create one internally and
just move the request coroutine to it around libssh calls. That could be
easy enough.)
