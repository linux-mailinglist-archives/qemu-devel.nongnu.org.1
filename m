It is problematic even if it is not init time. QEMU shouldn't implicitly 
add a PCI device without letting the management layer know.

For the virtio-net SR-IOV support which I have been preparing, I'm 
avoiding automatically adding PCI devices but instead letting the user 
create VFs. However, fixing existing SR-IOV devices (igb and nvme) will 
require more efforts and possible breaking changes of the command line.

I think it is a good idea to revert these patches for now, and add them 
back along with the virtio-net-pci SR-IOV support when the next merge 
window starts though I don't require to do so. If someone experiences 
this problem in the next merge window, we can advise to use 
virtio-net-pci, or to specify qemu:commandline to workaround it. We can 
start thinking of making a breaking change if neither of them satisfies 
the requirement.
