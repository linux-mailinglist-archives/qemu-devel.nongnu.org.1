The outcome is definitely nice, but it does looks slightly hacky to me and
make the test slightly more complicated.

If it's all about making sure we finish the 1st iteration, can we simply
add a src qemu parameter "switchover-hold"?  If it's set, src never
switchover to dst but keeps the iterations.

Then migrate_ensure_non_converge() will be as simple as setting
switchover-hold to true.

I am even thinking whether there can even be real-life use case for that,
e.g., where a user might want to have a pre-heat of a migration of some VM,
and trigger it immediately when the admin really wants (the pre-heats moved
most of the pages and keep doing so).

It'll be also similar to what Avihai proposed here on switchover-ack, just
an ack mechanism on the src side:
