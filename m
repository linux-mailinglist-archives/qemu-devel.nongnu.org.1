from python/setup.cfg; mypy >=3D 1.4.0
from python/tests/minreqs.txt; mypy=3D=3D1.4.0

This version is used for the minreqs test so I can be assured that we
haven't broken anything for the old pythons and the old type checkers. I
guarantee this version *will* work. I also guarantee the latest version
will work. I don't necessarily guarantee everything in between, but I make
my best effort.

Very extremely likely true! If people are fine with "you need PyPI and and
internet connection to run linter tests *at all*" we could move to the
latest version(s) (as supported per-python interpreter, at least) and be
done with it.

As I recall, some folks (Kevin Wolf?) had some requirements that they be
able to run iotests and so forth outside of configure, which makes this
kind of thing harder.

The tests grew out of ad-hoc scripts that had to work with whatever you
happened to have installed, though, and so it still supports a wide range
of linter versions for that reason. If I had my way, I'd stipulate we only
ever use a specific version that I pin quite close to the current bleeding
edge and then just periodically update the pin as needed for new features
or bugfixes or compatibility for shifting python interpreter support
windows.

If you want to discuss this and tackle it next release, I'm open to it,
I've just lost a *lot* of appetite for making new package version
requirement edicts in and around the build/doc/test system.
