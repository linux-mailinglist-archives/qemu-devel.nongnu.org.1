Can we put that in the "something silly" bucket? :-)
But yes, I'm not surprised that CXL runs into this. Heinrich,
are you doing CXL testing, or is this some other workload?

Mmm. The other assumption made in the design of the address_space_map()
API I think was that it was unlikely that a device would be trying
to do two DMA operations simultaneously. This is clearly not
true in practice. We definitely need to fix one end or other of
this API.

(I'm not sure why the bounce-buffer limit ought to be per-AddressSpace:
is that just done in Matthias' series so that we can attach an
x-thingy property to the individual PCI device?)
