The commit message is longer than the documentation it changes :-) That 
probably means the docs could be more detailed. For example this relation 
to the owner may be mentioned unless it's something to be changed in the 
future to clean this up.

Maybe it's just not clear to me but the title says "Add a reference to a 
memory region" then here it says "adds a reference to the owner" and does 
not say what happens if there's no owner present. Maybe it's better to be 
explicit and say add 1 to the owner's ref count or do nothing if owner is 
not present.

In "destroys it if present" it's not clear what "it" refers to as it can 
either be the memory region or the owner. I guess it's the owner but 
better state that to avoid confusion.
