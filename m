In general if it is visible from QMP it is liable to get probed - any
and every aspect of it is in scope.

To figure this out you need to produce a list of each command/struct/field
that has a 'if $TARGET' conditional, and check whether libvirt uses it or
not.

There challenge here is how QEMU will change this without back compat
problems.

Our deprecation process won't work well here. There's no nice way to flag
up that we're about to change the way conditionals work.

Most of the time libvirt adapts by changing the way we "probe the data",
but in this case its about adapting to the way we "probe data about the
data".

This kind of problem is why I liked the previous idea that Phillippe
was trying of introducing a "qemu-system-any" - it didn't affect the
behaviour of existing qemu-system-$TARGET commands, so apps had a
clean line in the sand between old & new behaviour.

With regards,
Daniel
