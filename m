If we allow a bounce buffer only to be used once (via the in_use flag), 
why do we allow only a single bounce buffer?

Could address_space_map() allocate a new bounce buffer on every call and 
address_space_unmap() deallocate it?

Isn't the design with a single bounce buffer bound to fail with a 
multi-threaded client as collision can be expected?

Best regards

Heinrich
