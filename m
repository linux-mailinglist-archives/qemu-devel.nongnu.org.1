Let's reword the above to:

Secure IPL (a.k.a. secure boot) enables s390-ccw virtual machines to
leverage qcrypto libraries and z/Architecture emulations to verify the
integrity of signed kernels. The qcrypto libraries are used to perform
certificate validation and signature-verification, whereas the
z/Architecture emulations are used to ensure secure IPL data has not
been tampered with, convey data between QEMU and userspace, and set up
the relevant secure IPL data structures with verification results.

To find out more about using this feature, see docs/system/s390x/secure-ipl.

Note that "userspace" will refer to the s390-ccw BIOS unless stated
otherwise.

Both QEMU and userspace work in tandem to perform secure IPL. The Secure
Loading Attributes Facility (SCLAF) is used to check the Secure Code
Loading Attribute Block (SCLAB) and ensure that secure IPL data has not
been tampered with. DIAGNOSE 'X'320' is invoked by userspace to query
the certificate store info and retrieve specific certificates from QEMU.
DIAGNOSE 'X'508' is used by userspace to leverage qcrypto libraries to
perform signature-verification in QEMU. Lastly, userspace generates and
appends an IPL Information Report Block (IIRB) at the end of the IPL
Parameter Block, which is used by the kernel to store signed and
verified entries.

The logical steps are as follows:

- Userspace reads data payload from disk (e.g. stage3 boot loader, kernel)

> +- Userspace invokes DIAG 508 subcode 1 and provides it the payload

structures are outlined within this document.

Add header:

s390 Certificate Store and Functions
====================================

Reword the above to:

A certificate store is implemented for s390-ccw guests to retain within
memory all certificates provided by the user via the command-line, which
are expected to be stored somewhere on the host's file system. The store
will keep track of the number of certificates, their respective size,
and a summation of the sizes.

Reword the sentence above to:

DIAGNOSE 'X'320' is used to provide support for userspace to directly
query the s390 certificate store. Userspace may be the s390-ccw BIOS or
the guest kernel.

Feedback:

Can you provide a sentence or two describing how this "provides
additional security"?  What exactly does this do?

Feedback:

These modes are described in the other document, and the error behavior
is covered there as well. You can remove the two lines above.

Feedback:

I think it reads better by simply combining the SCLAF and SCLAB sections
(i.e. no sub sub header for SCLAB).  Simply have SCLAF reference that a
SCLAB will be generated, and go into detail what it contains and what
it's for.

The SCLAF/SCLAB section is a bit difficult to digest as to what exactly
it does for secure IPL... might be a bit *too* technical :)

Reword to:

Perform signature-verification on a signed component, using certificates
from the certificate store and leveraging qcrypto libraries to perform
this operation.
