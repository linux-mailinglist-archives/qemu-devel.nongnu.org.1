I'm not against changing this, I just think it's going to increase complexity
for little value.  

I personally like the idea of keeping it the way it is and slapping a small
proxy on top that emulates the "out of band" interface to the device - but
all it does behind the scenes is send out a QMP command (that already exists)
to a guest that registered itself with the proxy.

This separates the complexity of implementing FMAPI functionality and the
complexity of how an individual instance of QEMU go about handling
add/access/remove semantics for DCD events.

The annoying thought experiment here is when someone wants their in-band
host interface to have access to the FMAPI

great now i've made myself grumpy

Yeah that's probably what it was.  I think that's what I was basing it off of
at the time.
