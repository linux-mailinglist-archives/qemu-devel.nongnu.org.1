It may depends on how "many times" are defined. :) IIUC, booting QEMU could
still be pretty fast, but yes, worth measuring.

If that works at least functionally (which also needs some double checking
I guess..), it would be great if you would compare the perf difference
v.s. your solution, that'll be very helpful material for reviewers to read
when/if you're going to propose the feature.

True, I didn't take disks into consideration.  Maybe disk files can be
snapshotted and recovered separately using either qcow2's snapshots, or
using snapshots on modern file systems like btrfs.  Good to know you seem
to have ways to work it out in all cases.
