Avocado runs a first pass doing all of the downloads, and only afterward runs the actual 
timed tests.  I don't know the specifics of how, but it certainly obvious in the logging.

Sure, that's one possibility.

I think that if we *don't* do this, then we cannot run in CI *at all* because we will be 
plagued with false timeouts.

And, frankly, any developer more than a few time zones away from the hosting of the asset 
will be continually frustrated.

I repeat: this is a show-stopper.
