Alright, I checked.

In documentation of command announce-self, the example moves from after
the arguments to before.  Unwanted change.

I can keep it in place if I insert a TODO before the example like this:

    diff --git a/qapi/net.json b/qapi/net.json
    index 9a723e56b5..50bfd5b681 100644

I had to delete the .doctrees cache to make sphinx-build generate

I figure an alternative would be a more flexible "...".

Two hunks up, you dumb one down:

    - # Example:
    + # .. qmp-example::
      #
      #     -> { "execute": "query-blockstats" }
      #     <- {
    - #          ... lots of output ...
    + #          ...
      #        }

If qmp_lexer.py understood this more verbose ellipsis, we could use
something like

      #    -> ... input ...
      #    <- ... output ...

Worth the bother?  Certainly not just for tests.  Maybe for nicer
examples in real documentation?  Up to you!

I think you mean my "Rendering to text now loses the "Example" heading"
on "[PATCH 13/13] qapi: convert "Example" sections to rST".  The diff
above demonstrates it's no longer lost.

There's a tiny issue you may or may not want to address: an example
isn't always separated by a blank line.  To reproduce, add my TODO hack
to announce-self, and examine qemu-qmp-ref.txt:

    "announce-self" (Command)
    -------------------------

    Trigger generation of broadcast RARP frames to update network
    switches.  This can be useful when network bonds fail-over the active
    slave.


    Arguments
    ~~~~~~~~~

--> The members of "AnnounceParameters"
--> Example::

       -> { "execute": "announce-self",
            "arguments": {
                "initial": 50, "max": 550, "rounds": 10, "step": 50,
                "interfaces": ["vn2", "vn3"], "id": "bob" } }
       <- { "return": {} }
