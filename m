From: David Woodhouse <dwmw@amazon.co.uk>

The vmclock device addresses the problem of live migration with
precision clocks. The tolerances of a hardware counter (e.g. TSC) are
typically around =C2=B150PPM. A guest will use NTP/PTP/PPS to discipline th=
at
counter against an external source of 'real' time, and track the precise
frequency of the counter as it changes with environmental conditions.

When a guest is live migrated, anything it knows about the frequency of
the underlying counter becomes invalid. It may move from a host where
the counter running at -50PPM of its nominal frequency, to a host where
it runs at +50PPM. There will also be a step change in the value of the
counter, as the correctness of its absolute value at migration is
limited by the accuracy of the source and destination host's time
synchronization.

The device exposes a shared memory region to guests, which can be mapped
all the way to userspace. In the first phase, this merely advertises a
'disruption_marker', which indicates that the guest should throw away any
NTP synchronization it thinks it has, and start again.

Because the region can be exposed all the way to userspace, applications
can still use time from a fast vDSO 'system call', and check the
disruption marker to be sure that their timestamp is indeed truthful.

The structure also allows for the precise time, as known by the host, to
be exposed directly to guests so that they don't have to wait for NTP to
resync from scratch.

The values and fields are based on the nascent virtio-rtc specification,
and the intent is that a version (hopefully precisely this version) of
this structure will be included as an optional part of that spec. In the
meantime, a simple ACPI device along the lines of VMGENID is perfectly
sufficient and is compatible with what's being shipped in certain
commercial hypervisors.

+ * This structure provides a vDSO-style clock to VM guests, exposing the
+ * relationship (or lack thereof) between the CPU clock (TSC, timebase, ar=
ch
+ * counter, etc.) and real time. It is designed to address the problem of
+ * live migration, which other clock enlightenments do not.
+ *
+ * When a guest is live migrated, this affects the clock in two ways.
+ *
+ * First, even between identical hosts the actual frequency of the underly=
ing
+ * counter will change within the tolerances of its specification (typical=
ly
+ * =C2=B150PPM, or 4 seconds a day). This frequency also varies over time =
on the
+ * same host, but can be tracked by NTP as it generally varies slowly. Wit=
h
+ * live migration there is a step change in the frequency, with no warning=
.
+ *
+ * Second, there may be a step change in the value of the counter itself, =
as
+ * its accuracy is limited by the precision of the NTP synchronization on =
the
+ * source and destination hosts.
+ *
+ * So any calibration (NTP, PTP, etc.) which the guest has done on the sou=
rce
+ * host before migration is invalid, and needs to be redone on the new hos=
t.
+ *
+ * In its most basic mode, this structure provides only an indication to t=
he
+ * guest that live migration has occurred. This allows the guest to know t=
hat
+ * its clock is invalid and take remedial action. For applications that ne=
ed
+ * reliable accurate timestamps (e.g. distributed databases), the structur=
e
+ * can be mapped all the way to userspace. This allows the application to =
see
+ * directly for itself that the clock is disrupted and take appropriate
+ * action, even when using a vDSO-style method to get the time instead of =
a
+ * system call.
+ *
+ * In its more advanced mode. this structure can also be used to expose th=
e
+ * precise relationship of the CPU counter to real time, as calibrated by =
the
+ * host. This means that userspace applications can have accurate time
+ * immediately after live migration, rather than having to pause operation=
s
+ * and wait for NTP to recover. This mode does, of course, rely on the
+ * counter being reliable and consistent across CPUs.
+ *
+ * Note that this must be true UTC, never with smeared leap seconds. If a
+ * guest wishes to construct a smeared clock, it can do so. Presenting a
+ * smeared clock through this interface would be problematic because it
+ * actually messes with the apparent counter *period*. A linear smearing
+ * of 1 ms per second would effectively tweak the counter period by 1000PP=
M
+ * at the start/end of the smearing period, while a sinusoidal smear would
+ * basically be impossible to represent.
+ *
+ * This structure is offered with the intent that it be adopted into the
+ * nascent virtio-rtc standard, as a virtio-rtc that does not address the =
live
+ * migration problem seems a little less than fit for purpose. For that
+ * reason, certain fields use precisely the same numeric definitions as in
+ * the virtio-rtc proposal. The structure can also be exposed through an A=
CPI
+ * device with the CID "VMCLOCK", modelled on the "VMGENID" device except =
for
+ * the fact that it uses a real _CRS to convey the address of the structur=
e
+ * (which should be a full page, to allow for mapping directly to userspac=
e).
