There are some SoCs that have memory mapped devices but different versions 
in the same family have different devices. Either older ones missing some 
devices or have less USB or network ports while newer SoCs have more of 
those or they have PCIe instead of PCI. Modelling these could use 
pluggable sysbus devices so one could add the devices needed for a SoC 
version without having to write or modify a board code. I think Bernhard's 
attempt to try creating e500 SoCs from a device tree goes in that 
direction too. We could also model this by having a SoC that can 
instantiate devices based on some properties but maybe pluggable devices 
could be more generic for this. The issue seems to be how to tell the 
board or SoC where to map it and what IRQ to connect it as this is done by 
the board and not the device so properties on the device to set these does 
not really help unless the board can somehow query it and instantiate the 
devices based on that. Otherwise whatever handles the -device option to 
create the device would need knowledge about the board. (E.g. the e500 
devices are mapped in the CCSR memory region so one can't just use system 
address space for them.)
