So, for this lookup to work, the reference must either be of the form
NAMESPACE:MODULE and resolve to that module in that namespace, or of the
form NAMESPACE:MODULE:DEFN and resolve to that definition in that module
in that namespace.  Correct?

These a "fully qualified names (FQN)" in your parlance, right?

Note that the first form is syntactically indistinguishable from
NAMESPACE:DEFN, i.e. a reference to a definition that specifies the
namespace, but not the module.

If the NAMESPACE:MODULE interpretation resolves, we never try the
NAMESPACE:DEFN interpretation, because that happens in later steps.
Correct?

The first form is fully qualified only if it resolves as FQN.  So,
whether such a reference is fully qualified is not syntactically
decidable.  Hmm.

We try this lookup only when the reference lacks a namespace and we are
"in" a namespace, or when it lacks a module and we are "in" a module.
Correct?

We then subsitute current namespace / module for the lacking one(s), and
try the same lookup as in 1.  Correct?

If we have a reference of the form MYSTERY, it could either be a
reference to module MYSTERY in the current namespace, or to definition
MYSTERY in the current namespace and module.  How do we decide?

Look for the name in all of the namespace's modules?

Look for the name in all modules so named in all namespaces?

?

Look for the name anywhere?

I need examples :)
