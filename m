If the config space is small, why loading it in sequence would be a
problem?

Have you measured how much time it needs to load one VF's config space that
you're using?  I suppose that's vfio_load_device_config_state() alone?

However I wonder whether we can keep it simple in that VFIO's config space
is still always saved in vfio_save_state().  I still think it's easier we
stick with the main channel whenever possible.  For this specific case, if
the config space is small I think it's tricky you bypass this with:

    if (migration->multifd_transfer) {
        /* Emit dummy NOP data */
        qemu_put_be64(f, VFIO_MIG_FLAG_END_OF_STATE);
        return;
    }

Then squash this as the tail of the iterable data.

On the src, I think it could use a per-device semaphore, so that iterable
save() thread will post() only if it finishes dumping all the data, then
that orders VFIO iterable data v.s. config space save().

On the dst, after a 2nd thought, MIG_CMD_SEND_NON_ITERABE may not work or
needed indeed, because multifd bypasses the main channel, so if we send
anything like MIG_CMD_SEND_NON_ITERABE on the main channel it won't
guarantee multifd load all complete.  However IIUC that can be used in a
similar way as the src qemu I mentioned above with a per-device semaphore,
so that only all the iterable data of this device loaded and applied to the
HW would it post(), before that, vfio_load_state() should wait() on that
sem waiting for data to ready (while multifd threads will be doing that
part).  I wonder whether we may reuse the multifd recv thread in the
initial version, so maybe we don't need any other threads on destination.

The load_finish() interface is currently not able to be reused right,
afaict.  Just have a look at its definition:

    /**
     * @load_finish
     *
     * Poll whether all asynchronous device state loading had finished.
     * Not called on the load failure path.
     *
     * Called while holding the qemu_loadvm_load_finish_ready_lock.
     *
     * If this method signals "not ready" then it might not be called
     * again until qemu_loadvm_load_finish_ready_broadcast() is invoked
     * while holding qemu_loadvm_load_finish_ready_lock.
     *
     * @opaque: data pointer passed to register_savevm_live()
     * @is_finished: whether the loading had finished (output parameter)
     * @errp: pointer to Error*, to store an error if it happens.
     *
     * Returns zero to indicate success and negative for error
     * It's not an error that the loading still hasn't finished.
     */
    int (*load_finish)(void *opaque, bool *is_finished, Error **errp);

It's over complicated on defining all its details:

  - Not re-entrant by default.. this is so weirdly designed so that the
    caller needs to know which is even the "1st invocation of the
    function"... It is just weird.

  - Requires one more global mutex that non vmstate handler ever requested,
    that I feel like perhaps can be replaced by a sem (then to drop the
    condvar)?

  - How qemu_loadvm_load_finish_ready_broadcast() interacts with all
    above..

So if you really think it matters to load whatever VFIO device who's
iterable data is ready first, then let's try come up with some better
interface..  I can try to think about it too, but please answer me
questions above so I can understand what I am missing on why that's
important.  Numbers could help, even if 4 VF and I wonder how much diff
there can be.  Mostly, I don't know why it's slow right now if it is; I
thought it should be pretty fast, at least not a concern in VFIO migration
world (which can take seconds of downtime or more..).

IOW, it sounds more reasonalbe to me that no matter whether vfio will
support multifd, it'll be nice we stick with vfio_load_state() /
vfio_save_state() for config space, and hopefully it's also easier it
always go via the main channel to everyone.  In these two hooks, VFIO can
do whatever it wants to sync with other things (on src, sync with
concurrent thread pool saving iterable data and dumping things to multifd
channels; on dst, sync with multifd concurrent loads). I think it can
remove the requirement on the load_finish() interface completely.  Yes,
this can only load VFIO's pci config space one by one, but I think this is
much simpler, and I hope it's also not that slow, but I'm not sure.

Thanks,
