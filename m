That's not _my_ idea, we already have that (see below). There's not much
reason to rename fields like that, the vmstate is obviously something
that should be kept stable, so having to do a rename in a script is way
better than having to figure out the fix for the compatibility break.

We should notify before merging any code. If there is a tool that can
catch the bug, there's no point in wasting everyone's time carrying that
patch forward. That's the purpose of a CI setup. These tests are very
light in terms of resources.

Now, you're making the point that these issues are rare, which they may
very well be, I haven't ran this long enough to know. I also don't know
how to measure that, I believe our CI already has a large amount of
tests that never catch anything, so I'm not sure how much we should take
it in consideration when adding tests to the CI.

About the possibly false results, we'll have to hold merging this for a
few releases and gather more data, see how much of a bother it is to
keep updating these fields. I expect to have more bugs caught by the
script than any renames happening.
