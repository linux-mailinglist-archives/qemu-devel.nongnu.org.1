Jonathan, thanks for review and comments. It's just an example that a problematic
64k host page can affect 16 4k guest pages. The errors aren't raised at the same
time because the SIGBUS signal is received by QEMU when the corresponding 4k guest
page is accessed. If all those errors are queued up and delivered at once, the
problem is when all those queued errors are delivered?

Besides, the problematic 64k host page affecting 16 4k guest page is an example.
when host/guest has same page size (e.g. 4KB), it's possible that two problematic
pages are detected by SIGBUS signals. It's also possible that one CPER error
is being delivered, but not acknowledged. A followup CPER error is raised to be
delivered. In this case, abort() is triggered either. So the problem isn't specific
64k host page size + 4k guest page size.

Thanks,
Gavin
