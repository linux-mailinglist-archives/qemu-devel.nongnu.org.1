This is the limitation of the SFTP API we have (and a reason why we
have a new API below, but only in new 0.11.0 release so not solution
for older systems that wont get new libssh).

Its more "streaming" API allowing the request and response overlap in time
allowing better throughput on networks with large latency.

To support fully non blocking API in SFTP, there is still way to go, but th=
is
api should be more ready for that than the old one.

Are you sure that with the old libssh versions you were getting SSH_AGAIN
in non-blocking mode? Michael in the following comment found the
change where the issue started to demonstrate:

https://gitlab.com/libssh/libssh-mirror/-/issues/280#note_2204139954
https://gitlab.com/libssh/libssh-mirror/-/commit/2d3b7e07af3675b9a0326bc5c6=
253a0bbbda567b

And from what I read, it was just silently behaving as blocking
(potentially infinitely)
instead of returning SSH_AGAIN deep in libssh code.

Right now, we do not have a full solution. But having SFTP working
completely in nonoblocking mode is one of the things we would like to have
in the long term.

My understanding is that the thread safety of libssh is limited to not shar=
ing
session between threads -- there is no synchronization if two threads would
send packets at the same time:

https://api.libssh.org/master/

If you will make sure you will not call sftp_read()/sftp_write() at
the same time
from different threads, it might work, but it is untested.

(joined the ML so I hope this mail will make it there)
