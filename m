As long as I don't have to type that and can use -M arm:raspi as a 
shorthand that's OK but then we could just make an exception for this and 
combine target and machine name here for simplicity. Unless it's simpler 
to internally use separate name and target attributes and implement a 
command line shorthand. You'll also need a way to display machine list 
with target and name in a way that's easy to parse for tools for which the 
target:name format seems like a trivial way. So I don't mind how you 
rationalise it and call all of it the machine name or if it's implemented 
as separate name and target attributes but please try to keep the command 
line something a human can use too.
