Yes, that’s correct.

I didn’t do any perf, but from my simplistic understanding, combined
TLBs should be faster as they use only one look up for full translation,
also I guess having a single TLB would be better for HW area.
(However my knowledge in this “area” is almost null)
Although in SW, we don’t have tough memory constraints and having more
(or separate) TLBs isn’t a problem.

While implementing this, at some point I thought it’s getting too
complicated and a separate one might have been better, but the
grass is always greener on the other side, and I believe it would
also have its challenges.

One other thing I like about combined TLBs (which I am not sure is
important for qemu) is that it is more relaxed which means it would
catch more SW bugs. For example if the SW only changes an IPA and
only invalidates by IPA, it would have issues with combined TLBs.

I am open to try other designs if you have something else in mind.

Thanks,
Mostafa
