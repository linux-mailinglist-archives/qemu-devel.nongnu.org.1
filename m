Hi Jonathan,

I think we should not allow to release extents that are still pending to
add. 
If we allow it, there is a case that will not work.
Let's see the following case (time order):
1. Send request to add extent A to host; (A --> pending list)
2. Send request to release A from the host; (Delete A from pending list,
hoping the following add response for A will fail as there is not a matched
extent in the pending list).
3. Host send response to the device for the add request, however, for
some reason, it does not accept any of it, so updated list is empty,
spec allows it. Based on the spec, we need to drop the extent at the
head of the event log. Now we have problem. Since extent A is already
dropped from the list, we either cannot drop as the list is empty, which
is not the worst. If we have more extents in the list, we may drop the
one following A, which is for another request. If this happens, all the
following extents will be acked incorrectly as the order has been
shifted.
 
Does the above reasoning make sense to you?
