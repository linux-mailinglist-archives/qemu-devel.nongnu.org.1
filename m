Hi Alistair,

Could you please provide your inputs on whether we can remove this
pflash0 check completely and assume pflash will always have S-mode
payload? 

I realized you responded to similar patch from Yong at [1] which I
missed since qemu-riscv was not copied. My v2 patch is similar to Yong's
patch but the feedback from distro experts is that, it better we align
with other architectures.

Based on your feedback, I will modify the patch and send v3.

Thanks
Sunil
