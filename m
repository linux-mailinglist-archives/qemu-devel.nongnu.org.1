It may not be too early as QEMU may already support heterogeneous 
endianness.

An Arm CPU have a register to switch the endianness, which depends on 
the current Exception level, and QEMU already implements it at least 
enough to switch the endianness for virtio if I read the code correctly.

This means QEMU should already be able to handle cases where the 
endianness changes depending on:
- timing (due to writes to SCLR or switches among Exception levels) or
- vCPUs (as each vCPU has its own register instance).

If virtio has a problem with heterogeneous endianness, I'm afraid that 
it matters even now for Arm emulation.

In my understanding, the virtio code is written carefully enough to 
avoid breaking migration and I found no other obvious problems like 
crashes and memory leaks with heterogeneous endianness, so I can 
conclude that the virtio code requires no change.

However, allowing to have legacy devices with heterogeneous endianness 
may still lead to mismatches between QEMU and user's expectations as the 
spec is not clear. Deprecating the combination of legacy devices with 
CPUs that can switch endianness (and other heterogeneous endianness 
scenarios in the future) may be a good idea to avoid that.
