Hello Florian,

thanks for your interest about QEMU plugins.
As you noticed, we recently expanded API to be able to modify state of 
executed program/machine. Before that, plugins were limited to observe 
what is happening, without allowing any modification. One of the reasons 
if that it might break QEMU in subtle ways, but we came to realize that 
benefits are worth the risk.

The vcpu_syscall_ret callback is called just at the end of do_syscall 
(before returning value), so this is why the value does not get overwritten.

If you replace the returned value at the right point, which should be 
the next instruction after svc (instruction callbacks are called 
*before* instruction is executed), this should overwrite the return as 
expected.

Before talking about the how and what, it could be useful to explain why 
it's needed to replace syscalls.

It's not clear for me how a program can do anything useful if we replace 
real syscalls with fake stubs or skip them. Could you give us a bit more 
details about your work and goals? This will help going in the right 
direction for what you need.
