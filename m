I agree this testing is enough to ensure there is no big impact. I just 
wanted to make sure there is some testing and not just adding stuff 
without worrying about performance. I'd like to keep QEMU quick and only 
add unavoidable overhead where possible but I don't demand to spend too 
much time on that. If Julian got interested and does more testing that may 
give some interesting results for possible optimisation but if no time for 
that this was enough to measure the impact for this series.
