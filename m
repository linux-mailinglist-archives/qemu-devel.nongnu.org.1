That would mean we don't get any names for threads which are spawned
indirectly.  There are quite a lot of libraries that QEMU can use,
which can spawn threads behind QEMU's back, and these threads can
still be running QEMU code through callbacks. spice, gstreamer,
jack and librbd are some I know that spawn threads, but there are
likely quite a few more. In the the jack case we hook into its thread
creation to set a name ourselves, but we can't rely on that in general,
and these libraries may well have set thread names we should use. 

I want to maximise the cases where we can retrieve a thread name.
While the code is more verbose than I'd like, it exists now so I
don't think its good to throw it away to put into a worse solution.

With regards,
Daniel
