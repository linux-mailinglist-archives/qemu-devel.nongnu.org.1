I've just looked at pycotap and IIUC, there's no command line
tool equivalent to '/usr/bin/pytest' at all. Each test case
is expected to provide a stub for "__main__" to invoke the
tests. As such each individual test is directly executable.
This meshes nicely with what I'd suggested as changes in
patch 1, and eliminating the intermediate runner process is
a nice further simplification. So I'll be interested to see
your next version using pycotap.


With regards,
Daniel
