Letting argv[0] affect behavior is problematic.  See prior discussion:

QAPI conditionals are designed to provide build-time configuration.  In
C, we use #if for that.  QAPI conditionals are merely a slight
abstraction of C #if.  Used to be even slighter until merge commit
c83fcfaf8a5.

Two kinds of #if conditions in QEMU C code:

1. True build-time configuration, i.e. control what's being built based
on what the host can do and what the user wants, as figured out by
configure.  These conditions are the same for the entire build.

2. Specializing target-specific code.  These conditions vary per target.
C code using them needs to be compiled per target.

To get a single binary, we want to reduce use of the second kind as much
as practical.  This can involve replacing compile-time conditionals by
run-time checks.  Remaining target-specific code needs to adjusted so
target-specific code for multiple targets can coexist in the single
binary.

Trouble is some uses of the second kind are in QAPI conditionals.  I can
see three options:

(1) Drop these conditionals.

(2) Replace them by run-time checks.

(3) Have target-specific QAPI-generated code for multiple targets
    coexist in the single binary.

As far as I can tell, your RFC series is an incomplete attempt at (2).

I gather you considered (3), but you dislike it for its bloat and
possibly other reasons.  I sympathize; the QAPI-generated code is plenty
bloated as it is, in good part to early design decisions (not mine).

Your "no noticeable differences" goal precludes (1).

Back to (2).  In C, replacing compile-time conditionals by run-time
checks means replacing #if FOO by if (foo).  Such a transformation isn't
possible in the QAPI schema.  To make it possible, we need to evolve the
QAPI schema language.

docs/devel/qapi-code-gen.rst describes what we have:

        COND = STRING
             | { 'all: [ COND, ... ] }
             | { 'any: [ COND, ... ] }
             | { 'not': COND }

    [....]

    The C code generated for the definition will then be guarded by an #if
    preprocessing directive with an operand generated from that condition:

     * STRING will generate defined(STRING)
     * { 'all': [COND, ...] } will generate (COND && ...)
     * { 'any': [COND, ...] } will generate (COND || ...)
     * { 'not': COND } will generate !COND

So, conditions are expression trees where the leaves are preprocessor
symbols and the inner nodes are operators.

It's not quite obvious to me how to best evolve this to support run-time
checks.

Whatever we choose should support generating Rust and Go as well.  Why?
Rust usage in QEMU is growing, and we'll likely need to generate some
Rust from the QAPI schema.  Victor Toso has been working on Go bindings
for use in Go QMP client software.

QAPI was designed to be compile-time static.  Revising such fundamental
design assumptions is always fraught.  I can't give you a confident
assessment now.  All I can offer you is my willingness to explore
solutions.  See "really fancy" below.

Fun fact: we used to generate the value of query-qmp-schema as a single
string.  We switched to the current, more bloated representation to
support conditionals (commit 7d0f982bfbb).

We have to unless we make query-cpu-definitions fail or impossible to
send while the target is still undecided.

Making it fail would violate the "no observable differences" goal.

The only path to true "no observable differences" I can see is to fix
the target before the management application interacts with QEMU in any
way.  This would make QMP commands (query-cpu-definitions,
query-qmp-schema, ...) impossible to send before the target is fixed.

Unclear.  See "fundamental design assumptions" and "need to evolve the
QAPI schema language" above.

If you want to learn more about introspection, I'd recommend
docs/devel/qapi-code-gen.rst section "Client JSON Protocol
introspection".
