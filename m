While it might be the cause in this case, my feeling is it's more fundamental
here - it's the whole reason that postcopy has a separate ram listen
thread.  As the destination is running, after it loads it's devices
and as it starts up the destination will be still loading RAM 
(and other postcopiable devices) potentially for quite a while.
Holding the bql around the ram listen thread means that the
execution of the destination won't be able to take that lock
until the postcopy load has finished; so while that might apparently
complete, it'll lead to the destination stalling until that's finished
which defeats the whole point of postcopy.
That last one probably won't fail a test but it will lead to a long stall
if you give it a nice big guest with lots of RAM that it's rapidly
changing.

However, the only devices that *should* be arriving on the channel
that the postcopy_ram_listen_thread is reading from are those
that are postcopiable (i.e. RAM and hmm block's dirty_bitmap).
Those load handlers are safe to be run while the other devices
are being changed.   Note the *should* - you could add a check
to fail if any other device arrives on that channel.

It happens!
You could make this safer by having a load_state and a load_state_postcopy
member, and only mark the load_state as requiring the lock.

It's not a straight equivalent; it's about a decade since I've
thought about COLO, so I can't quite remember when that thread
runs.

I meant a higher level description of what the series is doing.
