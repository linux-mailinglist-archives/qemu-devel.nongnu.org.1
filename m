When I think about the code generator and how this will all
evolve over time, I have a strong feeling that none of this
should be in qemu.git.

Taking those three interfaces in (1)(c), when we come to actually
generate implementations of them, the generated code is going to
be intimately tied to the client/server API framework we need to
plumb into.

IMHO qemu.git should not have any knowledge of this, as it will
create a bidirectional dependency betweeen qemu.git and the
qemu-go.git repo, requiring them to evolve in lockstep.

We'll need 3 releases of the Go code per year, to match the
introduction the new QAPI schema versions, but outside that I
think there ought to be the freedom to have other Go releases
independently.

The need for this to be part of qemu.git is fairly narrow. It
provides a new hook into the QAPI generator code, and the QAPI
generator is not installed by 'make install', it is in-tree
only.

Can we solve this linkage ? We would need to be able to:

 * Have a mechanism for the QAPI code generator to load
   new genrator backends
 * Have a mechanism to tell the QAPI code generator to
   only run a single backend.
 * Have a mechanism to consume the QAPI code genrfator
   from outside qemu.git

The first point there could be addressable using the python "entry-points"
concept

  https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/entry-points/
  https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html#entry-points

Or, alternatively by passing the name of a python module on the CLI.

The second point is just a bit of glue code to wire up a new CLI arg

The third point either involves having 'make install' put the QAPI
code generator into /usr/share/qemu, or /usr/lib/python3.x. The
latter would be if QAPI code generator were a formally release python
module on pypi. The former would be if we're just trying a QAPI code
generator as a local tool, not for pypi. A fallback would be to
consume qemu.git as a git submodule from qapi-go.git. The gitmodule
commit would not have to match the version of the QAPI schema we are
generating code for.

The least effort approach would be making QAPI code genrator accept
a python module name, and call it via a git submodule. This would
avoid declaring a long term support policy for the QAPI code gen
python APIs as a blocker.
