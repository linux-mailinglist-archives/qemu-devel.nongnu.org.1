My original motivation with this API was to expose arch specific attributes
to the guest, most notably RISC-V 'riscv-aia' properties, that are defined by
RISC-V kvm_arch_accel_class_init().

In fact the very first impl I did was just a list of properties that each arch
would want to advertise, like query-cpu-model-expansion does, and then each
arch would be responsible to fill in whatever they want to advertise. I decided
to go with this current approach instead because it would bring more discussions
to the table, instead of making a RISC-V specific API that only RISC-V folks
would care about.

Reading all the thread I wonder if we should go back to my original intent and
make the API arch specific and let every arch define what they want to expose.
Seems simpler than to make a catch all API for all archs. Each arch would be
responsible for the stability of their schema and so on.

We're still adding RISC-V specific properties in the KVM accel, so for now I
wouldn't mind implementing this API for x86 first just to validate the concept.
Granted, I have no idea what x86 would like to expose from the KVM accel (or any
other accel for that matter), so if someone could give me a list on what x86
would like to expose that would be terrific.


Thanks,

Daniel
