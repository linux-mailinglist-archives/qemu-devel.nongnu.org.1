I tend to see the 'python' directory as being for stuff we formally
maintain as a python API for use by multiple internal consumers.

This is just a bunch of helper files exclusively for use by the kernel-doc
tool, and so the scripts/ directory is a decent fit for it, given that this
dir is for a collection of arbitary supporting tools & scripts.

As precedent, see the tracetool, which keeps all its helpers under
scripts/tracetool too.

TL;DR: I would not want to see a new top level tools/ directory
created, and don't think it fits in python/ either; scripts/ is
a fine home.

With regards,
Daniel
