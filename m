The initial versioning support is no big deal, just a couple new functions
and macros. And, new versions which don't change anything or just change
the current state of preexisting properties and attributes also have very
little developer work. However, when changes require adding compat
variables, which scatter around if's to manage things in one way for
one machine version and another way for others, then code starts to get
more difficult to maintain. And, since adding compat variables is known to
cause a maintenance burden, then just about every change the machine model
gets will lead to time spent discussing whether or not a compat variable
is necessary. But, none of that is the worst part of versioned machines.
The worst part is that the test matrix explodes. Typically all test cases
will get run N times where N is the number of supported machine types,
even if for most test cases the machine type doesn't make a difference. So
that's a waste of time and energy. And, if nobody really cares about the
old machine types, then running test cases which do depend on the machine
type is still a waste of time and energy. And, of course, machine types
which are just a number bump, definitely lead to waste.

Having never versioned the machine type before, we're going break command
lines whether we put these types of changes behind machine versions or
into machine properties. Currently a command line only specifies 'virt',
so unless we leave 'virt' pointing at the current, which will be the
oldest, machine type forever, then users would need to change their
command lines to point at virt-1.0 or whatever in order to preserve their
configurations anyway. I think, particularly considering the current state
of RISC-V in production environments (not much), that we could instead
require users to change their command lines to be more explicit about what
they want, by using machine properties.

Regarding the 'virt' name, Arm also has 'virt' which is always an alias to
the latest virt-x.y machine. This works best for users who use libvirt,
since libvirt will convert the alias to the versioned name when storing it
in the XML. So, IMO, RISC-V should focus on libvirt support before QEMU
versioning, which also gets RISC-V closer to being used in production,
where machine versions are more important.

As for extensions and profiles, IMO, they shouldn't be coupled with the
machine type. Either the max CPU type should be used by default or users
should be required to select the CPU type, i.e. no default.
