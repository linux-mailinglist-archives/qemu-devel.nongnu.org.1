Missed this: it's 3.9 since

commit d64db833d6e3cbe9ea5f36342480f920f3675cea
Author: Thomas Huth <thuth@redhat.com>
Date:   Fri Apr 25 14:07:10 2025 +0200

    Drop support for Python 3.8
=20=20=20=20
    Python 3.8 went "end of life" in October 2024 and Fedora 42 dropped
    this version already, so the "python" CI job is currently failing.
    Thus it's time to drop support for this Python version in QEMU, too.
=20=20=20=20
    While we're at it, also look for "python3.13" in the configure script.

Too late to adjust the commit message.  Is there anything else in need
of adjustment?
