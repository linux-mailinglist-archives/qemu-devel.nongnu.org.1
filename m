I'm concerned we have other issues lurking, so I built qemu
with -Wframe-larger-than=8192 and looked at every source
file location it reported. I've not done performance testing
but I've found a decent number of locations that look like
they are in the I/O path, so likely hot paths. It seems I
was too naive when introducing -ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero
wrt possible perf hits.

The results are as follow, and show some areas we should
likely proactively marked with "QEMU_UNINITIALIZED' even
without checking perf results:

  - Many methods use the VhostUserGpuMsg struct which has a union where
    VhostUserGpuCursorUpdate has a 16kb data field.

    Varibles are initialized explicitly at declaration avoiding
    auto-init, but only the union branches that are needed. GCC
    may zero initialize unused branches, and possibly also
    union padding bytes.

    Hot paths => probably skip init
