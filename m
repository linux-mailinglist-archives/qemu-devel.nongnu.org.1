Hello,

This is the 6th revision of the vfio-user client implementation.

First of all, thank you for your time reviewing the previous versions.

The vfio-user framework consists of 3 parts:
 1) The VFIO user protocol specification.
 2) A client - the VFIO device in QEMU that encapsulates VFIO messages
    and sends them to the server.
 3) A server - a remote process that emulates a device.

This patchset implements parts 1 and 2.

It has been lightly tested against libvfio-user test servers as well as SPDK.
