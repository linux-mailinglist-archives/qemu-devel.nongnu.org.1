I tried running the kvm-unit-test a bunch of times in a loop and couldn't
trigger a failure. I just tried again on a different system and managed just
fine, yay. No idea why it wouldn't on the first system tho.

I can check if I can reproduce the issue before & after b0504edd ("migratio=
n:
Drop unnecessary check in ram's pending_exact()").
I can also check if I can reproduce it on x86, that worked last time.
Anything else? Ideas on how to pinpoint where the corruption happens?
