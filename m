Not that I'm aware, but there are a couple of things you might find useful to look
at; there is the'driftifx' option with the suboption 'slew' and the LOST_TICK_POLICY
flags (and option?) - I've never looked into how they work, but they're intended
to correct qemu time slowly in some cases - maybe it's a hint to places to glue
such a hack in?

You talk of using 'sleep' to slow the CPU down, however there is some code
in migration to slow CPUs down (but not clocks) to limit the rate at which
they generate migration data.   I think it's more subtle than a simple sleep,
running something on each CPU thread to sleep.
