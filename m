This bit of the codebase has got a bit more complicated since
I wrote up the bug report. I will look into this and get back
to you, but my suspicion is that these calls must return the
same value that the actual CPU MPIDR affinity values have,
because these values are going to end up in the DTB and ACPI
tables, and the OS will want them to match up with MPIDRs.

Yes, that's right.

The other thing we need to do is check the TRM (technical reference
manual) for the CPUs that were added since I filed that bug in
April 2023, to see if they need to have the flag set or not. The
ones we need to check are:
 * cortex-a710
 * neoverse-n2
 * neoverse-v1
