Today we can run the individual tests directly 

 # ./tests/functional/x86_64/test_reverse_debug.py
 TAP version 13
 ok 1 test_reverse_debug.ReverseDebugging_X86_64.test_x86_64_pc
 1..1


(assuming you have PYTHONPATH and QEMU_TEST_QEMU_BINARY env set)

This gives you a very easy way to interact with the test, see
its progress, understand what failed, and debug it with strace,
etc.

This change looses all that. It appears I can run it with

  # ./tests/guest-debug/run-test.py --quiet --gdb gdb --test \
       ./tests/functional/x86_64/test_reverse_debug.py

but the output is unintelligible

This undermines the core goals of what we aimed to achieve with
the new functional test harness.

IMHO the overall concept of using the run-test.py runner for launching
the tests is flawed and not viable. It adds too much complexity to the
use of the tests, and harms the output.

If any other tests needing GDB arrive int he future we can consider
them at that time.

I like the idea of the test being able to execute human gdb commands,
but I don't think the GDB provided 'gdb' module is viable to use
directly. We need to retain control over how we launch our tests
without intermediate runners present.

This is not exclusively about the meson.build changes. It is about the
overall execution environment of the tests being *simple* and easy to
understand. That is the overrriding goal of how we approached design
of the new functional test harness that made it valuable to spend the
time to replace avocado. The GDB runner usage undermines the benefits
we have achieved.

The tests need to be runnable directly as standalone python programs,
with well formed TAP output.

Given the limitations of GDB, if we want to use its python module, then
the proxy idea I describe above is the only way forward I see.
