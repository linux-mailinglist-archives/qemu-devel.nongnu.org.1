only one kind of interface should be in use. And for quite a while firmware shipped
with QEMU is using QEMU provided ACPI tables, which in turn switch interface to
modern hotplug when guest OS loads ACPI tables, see:
         if (opts.has_legacy_cphp) {                                              
            method = aml_method("_INI", 0, AML_SERIALIZED);
or firmware does the switch (OVMF usecase) before guest OS. 

if any hotplug action happened before guest switched hotplug favour,
it will trigger SCI, which guest OS should process it (incl. switching
to modern interface and sending necessary device check/remove events)
once ACPI tables are processed.

QEMU has delivered both events as it was intended (and in order plug then unplug).
I'd say that ignoring events is a guest bug. 

With unplug, potentially if fixing guest is not an option
one can try retry device_del to trigger unplug event again.

PS:
I vaguely recall linux kernel wiping GPE state on boot during
initialization, but that is guest problem and should be fixed
on guest side.
(unexpectedly enough, Windows handles GPE state as expected)

above should work especially with unplug event happening after guest OS has booted.
Lets simplify reproducer to QEMU only (i.e. getting rid of libvirt part) and see
where it leads us.

Once VM is in running state, clearing flags from QEMU side is not safe.
Effectively it would introduce a race with guest code.

Also I'm not sure that flags are the issue here,
Capturing some CPUHP traces on QEMU side and logs from guest side
might help to clarify what's going on.
