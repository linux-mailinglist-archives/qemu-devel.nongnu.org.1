The policy on only supporting the most recent 2 releases of an
OS applies universally regardless of the Tier levels. I should
state that explicitly in this new doc to make that clear.

IOW, maintainers are free to remove code that is only relevant
to OS versions /older/ than 2 releases whether that code is
broken or not.
