I haven't looked at the patchset in very close detail, but
(as we discussed at KVM Forum) my inclination is to prefer
to have explicitly separate halves rather than an Int128.
If we had a real compiler type int128_t everywhere I think
my opinion would be different, but as it is we can't write
operations on the field in an "obvious" way, and we have to
have clunky int128_* functions like this one:

+        flush_if_asid_change(env, int128_getlo(raw_read128(env, ri)),
+                             int128_getlo(value),
+                             ARMMMUIdxBit_E20_2 |
+                             ARMMMUIdxBit_E20_2_PAN |
+                             ARMMMUIdxBit_E20_0);

so there doesn't seem like a great deal of benefit to
defining an Int128 field.

Is some of the early part of this patchset useful refactoring
that we could get upstream already?

thanks
