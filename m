I am uncertain what you mean with "dynaminess" but I mean the ELF file
type, whether or not an interpreter is set and some additional sections
(like .dynamic) exist.

The prebuild binary before d884c86dcd was added in 553ce81c31e4 and shows a=
s
statically linked: (ET_EXEC is the ELF file type of static binaries)

~/src/qemu$ scanelf pc-bios/s390-ccw.img
 TYPE   FILE=20
ET_EXEC pc-bios/s390-ccw.img=20

and when the binary was rebuild after d884c86dcd in 2d5eeef1c0be it shows
as dynamically linked:

~/src/qemu$ scanelf pc-bios/s390-ccw.img
 TYPE   FILE=20
ET_DYN pc-bios/s390-ccw.img=20

(Same results with file(1) and readelf -l)

Latest file(1) release:
$ file --version
file-5.46
magic file from /usr/share/misc/magic

As mentioned above this is only about the file metadata and doesn't
affect the binary code part of the binary. So it is probably just
ignored by qemu and shouldn't change the bhaviour of qemu. This is
mostly to fix the intend of the commit that added -pie and exclude a
libc dependant string from a binary that isn't libc dependant.
