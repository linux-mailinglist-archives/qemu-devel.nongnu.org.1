Not all the writable ID regs are visible through the above technique.
But indeed I think we converged on the idea to use higher level feature
names than ID reg field values.
However we need to study the feasibility and mappings between those high
level features and ID reg field values.
The cons is that we need to describe this mapping manually. Besides
being cumbersome this is also error prone.

Agreed! Thank you for the references!
