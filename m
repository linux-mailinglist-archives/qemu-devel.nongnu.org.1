Sorry, should've stated this better. It is possible to specify arbitrary
key-value pairs with '-drive', and by "re-introduce" I mean allowing the
same for '-blockdev'.

Even with "cache=writeback" in QEMU, the RBD cache policy will default
to "writearound". And we do need "writeback" on the RBD side too:

Oh, that sounds like a good alternative :)
