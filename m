We have nic failover 'feature'
   https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/virtio-net-failover.html
to make it work we do abuse hotplug and that poses problem
during migration, since:
  - unplugging primary device releases resources (which might not be
    possible to claim back in case migration failure)
  - it's similar on destination side, where attempt to hotplug
    primary might fail die to insufficient resources leaving guest
    on 'degraded' virtio-net link.

Idea was that instead of hotplug we can power off primary device,
(it will still exist and keep resources), initiate migration,
and then on target do the same starting with primary fully realized
but powered of (and failing migration early if it can't claim resources,
safely resuming QEMU on source incl. primary link), and then guest
failover driver on destination would power primary on as part of
switching to primary link.

Above would require -device/device_add support for specifying device's
power state as minimum.
