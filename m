  Hi Cleber,

thanks for the explanation, but we really need to replace v88 rather *now* 
since v88 does not work with the latest versions of Python anymore (there is 
a work-around on Fedora fortunately, but it's completely broken on Ubuntu 
24.04 as far as I know). So even a single-threaded execution with v103 would 
have been better than waiting forever for your update to land. The problem 
with v88 being broken has been raised a couple of times already, but it's 
incredibly hard to get a response from you Avocado folks, so with hardly any 
help from the Avocado side, and nobody on the QEMU side being really 
familiar with the Avocado stuff, and with the meson test runner being used 
by all other subsystems in QEMU already, I think it's best if we continue 
with this series here.

Ok, good to know, we could maybe use that eventually for the tests that 
really require the Avocado framework (i.e. the cloud-init based tests).

For the others, as Daniel said in an earlier mail, it's much more convenient 
if you can also run the tests directly instead, without such a layer in 
between - that makes debugging way easier.

I didn't really see such a movement in recent times yet ... Could you point 
to an example?

autils sounds promising, but I just had a look at the repository, and there 
does not seem to be that much code available there yet, so I guess it will 
take still quite a long time 'til that's ready?
