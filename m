Which date stamp maintaining are you referring to? I can split the patch 
in two later today or tomorrow if you want and send a v2 but not right 
now. For that to compile and work after each patch it would need to add 
the new binary in one patch then remove the old one after changing its 
usage. Or maybe even 3 patches: first updating submodule, then adding 
binary rebuilt from that then changing usage and removing old one. I think 
this would make the series larger as git now seems to contain binary diff 
between old and new versions but if these are in different patch it may 
still add the removed binary as a binary patch. So this only works if the 
old and new binary is the same name or renamed in one patch but then that 
would break if the usage is not updated in the same patch. So maybe patch 
one to update submodule, patch 2 to add binary with old name and patch 3 
to rename the binary could work but does that worth the hassle and any 
better than this single patch?
