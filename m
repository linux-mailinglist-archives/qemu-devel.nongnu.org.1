What do you mean by distinct programs? It's not the migration-test that
decides on which targets it runs, it's meson.build. We register a test()
for each target, same as with any other qtest. Maybe I misunderstood
you...

This still requires a new make target I think. Otherwise we'd run *all*
thorough tests for a QEMU target and not only migration-test in thorough
mode.
