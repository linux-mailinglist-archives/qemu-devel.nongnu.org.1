I would rather avoid virtual or real lifecycles notions because it's 
more than free(). Memory regions constructed with functions like 
memory_region_init_io() and memory_region_init_ram_ptr() requires the 
owner to retain the backend resource to keep functioning. In other 
words, the memory region refers to the owner, and that is no different 
from other kind of references.

The uniqueness of this relationship is that the owner also refers to the 
memory region. Memory regions avoid a circular reference by omitting the 
reference from them to the owner and instruct others to refer to the 
owner instead.

The owner refers to the memory region in turn so it is fine omitting 
object_ref(mr). If you draw an object graph that originates from the 
referrer, you can still reach the memory region. That is not true for 
your patch; you cannot reach to the subregion from the container.

The separate lifetimes still matter even with your patch. In a 
hypothetical world that the lifetime of owner and memory regions 
completely match, the ordering of finalization of memory regions owned 
by one object simply does not happen because they occur simultaneously. 
It is simply not true, and even your patch does not make sense in such a 
hypothetical world.

Again, please forget about efficiency. It does not matter and makes 
noises in our thoughts.

This is better as it tells the lifetimes of memory regions need to be 
dealt with, but why don't you deal them with reference counters in that 
case? Reference counters are tools specifically designed for this.
