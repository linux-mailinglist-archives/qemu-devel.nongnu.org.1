I dread to think what jankier workarounds are!

However I accept that a doc string warning will do for now. I think if
we can strengthen the guarantee at a later date to make the feature more
bullet proof we should. For example we could use start/end_exclusive to
halt the other threads while patching is taking place and then trigger a
full tb-flush to be safe. It depends how often we expect to be patching
things out?

Richard,

Do you have any view about this?

Absolutely - I would like to see that too. The main reason those forks
haven't been up-streamable is because they have to make fairly invasive
changes to the frontends to do their instrumentation. I want to grow the
API to the point we can support these more advanced use cases. I am
however being conservative in adding new APIs so we take the time to get
each one right and minimise:

  - leaking internal details and constricting future evolution of the emula=
tor
  - giving the users too many foot guns in the API

I'll have a look at the next version and see how we are doing.
