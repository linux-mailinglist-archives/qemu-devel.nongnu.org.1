Why would that be ideal?

Whether or not to use std is a fundamental decision. It might be
difficult to back from std later on. This is something that should be
discussed in more detail.

Do you want to avoid std for maximum flexibility in the future, or are
there QEMU use cases today where std is unavailable?

I guess there will be interest in using rust-vmm crates in some way.

Bindings to platform features that are not available in core or std
will also be desirable. We probably don't want to reinvent them.

Do you mean vendoring by committing them to qemu.git or just the
practice of running `cargo vendor` locally for users who decide they
want to keep a copy of the dependencies?

Rust code will need to interface with QEMU's C APIs, so Rust wrappers
seem unavoidable. Using a protocol like vhost-user might be possible
in some cases. It separates the two codebases so they can both be
native and without bindings, but that won't work for all parts of the
QEMU source tree.

Stable APIs aren't necessary if most developers in the QEMU community
are willing to work in both languages. They can adjust both C and Rust
code when making changes to APIs. I find this preferable to having
Rust maintainers whose job is to keep wrappers up-to-date. Those Rust
maintainers would probably burn out. This seems like a question of
which approach the developer community is comfortable with.

This can be discussed in a separate email thread if you prefer, but I
do think it needs agreement soon so that people have the confidence to
invest their time in writing Rust. They need to know that the code
they develop will be available on most platforms where QEMU is
available and that others in the community won't object or insist on a
C implementation for platform support reasons.

What is the consequence of this? As long as the linker is bringing in
.o files from the .a only through symbol dependencies, then unused .o
files in the .a won't be linked into the final QEMU binary.
