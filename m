Done - I also moved the parts about x-migration-max-queued-buffers
and x-migration-load-config-after-iter description there since
obviously they wouldn't make sense being left alone in the top section.

I'm not sure what descriptions you exactly want in these places, but since
that's just documentation (not code) it could be added after the code freeze...

...which brings us to this point.

I think by this point in time (less then 2 weeks to code freeze) we should
finally decide what is going to be included in the patch set.

This way this patch set could be well tested in its final form rather than
having significant parts taken out of it at the eleventh hour.

If the final form is known also the documentation can be adjusted accordingly
and user/admin documentation eventually written once the code is considered
okay.

I though we discussed a few times the rationale behind both
x-migration-max-queued-buffers and x-migration-load-config-after-iter properties
but if you still have some concerns there please let me know before I prepare
the next version of this patch set so I know whether to include these.
