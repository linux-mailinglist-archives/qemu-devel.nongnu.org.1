So be it, that's far from the only wierd thing in virt.

The PCI/USB controller situation is not the same tradeoff though.
Those guest kernel drivers will identify and attach to these two
controllers regardless of their PCI vendor/product, via the PCI
class property. In that case changing the PCI ID and other device
metadata in QEMU is cheap as it has no negative impact on guest OS
driver compibility.

In the case of 6300ESB though the guest driver is tied directly to
the currently used PCI device product/vendor ID.

If we change this then we have actually created new functional
problems with guest/QEMU compatibility, in order to placate a
non-functional problem. That is not a good thing.

With regards,
Daniel
