(Assuming I'm parsing your last para right; correct me if not.)

Isn't a user wanting to add extra CPU flags (on top of a baseline) a
"normal behaviour" and not "extra complexity"?  Besides coming close to
a specific CPU model, there's the additional important use-case of CPU
flags that provide security mitigation.

Consider this:

Say, there's a serious security issue in a released ARM CPU.  As part of
the fix, two new CPU flags need to be exposed to the guest OS, call them
"secflag1" and "secflag2".  Here, the user is configuring a baseline
model + two extra CPU flags, not to get close to some other CPU model
but to mitigate itself against a serious security flaw.

An example that comes to mind is the infamous "speculative store bypass"
(SSB) vulnerability and how QEMU addressed it[1][2] in x86.  I'm sure,
as you know, it also affects ARM[3].
