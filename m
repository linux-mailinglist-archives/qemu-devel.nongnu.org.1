I wasn't clear - I meant other way around.
This series is built on a couple of Gregory's patches.  Gregory can suffer
the pain of rebasing his stuff ;) (or I'll do it depending on when things
land).

I was suggesting your next posting should just include those two with
your sign-off added. That way if everyone is happy with v8 Michael Tsirkin
can pick it up directly, saving a step.

Make sure to add Michael to the to list as well for next version.

Thanks,

Jonathan
