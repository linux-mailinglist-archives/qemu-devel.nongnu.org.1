Re-wrap the cpr-reboot documentation to 70 columns, use '@' for
cpr-reboot references, capitalize COLO and VFIO, and tweak the
wording.

 # @normal: the original form of migration. (since 8.2)
 #
-# @cpr-reboot: The migrate command stops the VM and saves state to the URI.
-#     After quitting qemu, the user resumes by running qemu -incoming.
-#
-#     This mode allows the user to quit qemu, and restart an updated version
-#     of qemu.  The user may even update and reboot the OS before restarting,
-#     as long as the URI persists across a reboot.
-#
-#     Unlike normal mode, the use of certain local storage options does not
-#     block the migration, but the user must not modify guest block devices
-#     between the quit and restart.
-#
-#     This mode supports vfio devices provided the user first puts the guest
-#     in the suspended runstate, such as by issuing guest-suspend-ram to the
-#     qemu guest agent.
-#
-#     Best performance is achieved when the memory backend is shared and the
-#     @x-ignore-shared migration capability is set, but this is not required.
-#     Further, if the user reboots before restarting such a configuration, the
-#     shared backend must be be non-volatile across reboot, such as by backing
-#     it with a dax device.
-#
-#     cpr-reboot may not be used with postcopy, colo, or background-snapshot.
