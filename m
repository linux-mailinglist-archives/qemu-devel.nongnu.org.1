Building the tables at compile time is fine, only leaving out the script is
not.

Ok, that makes sense. QEMU already has a decoder that is very table-based
though the tables are hand written. I am not wed to it though=E2=80=94as lo=
ng as
the code generators remain more or less unmodified, I would love to only
keep "these is how the operands are prepared for use in the IR emitters"
and make the details of x86 decoding Someone Else's Problem. So if you can
kill most (certainly not all) of the tables in
target/i386/tcg/decode-new.c.inc that would be interesting.

(I am sure you'd find some underspecified and/or wrong parts of the x86
spec, too :) For example many VEX classes are bollocks, plus some more
examples hinted at at the top of that file).

anyway, in fact it is just yet another disassembler at this point, but
