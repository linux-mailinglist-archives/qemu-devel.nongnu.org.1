I'd say that traces are like debug printfs that you don't normally want to 
see but may be interesting for developers for debugging a specific device 
model or QEMU part so you can enable the relevant ones for that device or 
part. Logs are something you want to notify the user or admin about and is 
not tracing internal operation of a device. But there may be some overlap 
as some logs could be converted to traces but they are under log for 
historical reasons as previously there were debug printfs controlled by 
defines in devices that were later converted to traces and logs that could 
be controlled in run time which were used for some traces before trace 
points existed. Then were probably kept as logs just to not change the 
command line because it's easier to type -d in_asm then say -trace 
enable="tcg_in_asm" or something like that.
