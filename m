Nice! Yeah, I had a branch here doing something similar for QEMU, 
but got sidetracked by other things and didn't have time to address
a couple of issues. I'm glad you find the time for it.

To make it easier to maintain and keep in sync with Kernel upstream,
perhaps we can try to change Kernel upstream to make easier for QEMU
to have a class override for the kdoc parser, allowing it to just
sync with Linux upstream, while having its own set of rules on a
separate file.

A RFC on that sense is welcomed. Otherwise, I'll try to spare some
time to think on a good way for doing that.

One thing that should be noticed is that Jonathan Corbet is currently
doing several cleanups at the Python script, simplifying some
regular expressions, avoiding them when str.replace() does the job
and adding comments. The end goal is to make it easier for developers
to understand and help maintaining its code.

So, it is probably worth backporting Linux upstream changes after
the end of Kernel 6.17 cycle.

The Kernel Sphinx plugin after the change is IMHO (*) a lot cleaner
than before, and hendles better kernel-doc warnings, as they are now
using Sphinx logger class.

(*) I'm a little bit suspicious when talking about it, as I did the
    changes there too ;-)

Btw, one important point to notice: if you picked the latest version
of kernel-doc, it currently requires at least Python 3.6 (3.7 is the 
recommended minimal one). It does check that, silently bailing out
if Python < 3.6. 

With Python 3.6, it emits a warning, as the parameter order for
structs and functions won't match the original order, as the script
assumes 3.7+ dict behavior where the insert order is preserved.

So, at QEMU build instructions, I would add a notice asking for at 
least 3.7 to build docs.

I'll review the actual patches later.
