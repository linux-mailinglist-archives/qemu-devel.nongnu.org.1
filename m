I am not convinced about the choice of using address_space_memory.

an address space different from address_space_memory

Yes my doubt is about:

smmuv3_accel_find_add_as()
     * We are using the global &address_space_memory here, as this will
ensure
     * same system address space pointer for all devices behind the
accelerated
     * SMMUv3s in a VM. That way VFIO/iommufd can reuse a single IOAS ID in
     * iommufd_cdev_attach(), allowing the Stage-2 page tables to be shared
     * within the VM instead of duplicating them for every SMMUv3 instance.
     */
    if (vfio_pci) {
        return &address_space_memory;

I think it would be cleaner to a have an AddressSpace allocated on
purpose to support the VFIO accel use case, if possible.
To me returning address_space_memory pretends we are not doing any
translation. I understand it is "easy" to reuse that one but I wonder it
is the spirit of the get_address_space callback.

I would rather allocate a dedicated (shared) AddressSpace to support the
VFIO accel case. That's my suggestion.

Well I am not an expert of AddressSpaces either. Reading hw/pci/pci.h
and get_address_space() callback API doc comment, I understand this is
the output address space for the PCI device. If you return

address_space_memory, to me this means there is no translation in place. By the way, this was the interpretation of kvm_arch_fixup_msi_route() on ARM

    AddressSpace *as = pci_device_iommu_address_space(dev)

    if (as == &address_space_memory) {
        return 0;
    }

    /* MSI doorbell address is translated by an IOMMU */

Note: I am currently out of the office so I am not able to reply as fast as you may wish.

Thanks
