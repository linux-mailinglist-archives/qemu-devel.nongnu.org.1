Hi Michael,

This is v10 of the patch series, rebased to apply after release
10.0. The only difference against v9 is a minor confict resolution.

I sent already the patch with conflicts, but, as you didn't pick,
I'm assuming you're opting to see the entire series again, as it
could make easier for you to use b4 or some other script you may
use to pick patches. So, let me resend the entire series.

It is nearly identical to v9 which addressed 3 issues:

- backward compatibility logic moved to version 10.0;
- fixed a compilation issue with target/arm/kvm.c (probably
  caused by some rebase - funny enough, incremental 
  compilation was fine here);
- added two missing SPDX comments.

As ghes_record_cper_errors() was written since the beginning
to be public and used by ghes-cper.c. It ended being meged
earlier because the error-injection series become too big,
so it was decided last year to split in two to make easier for
reviewers and maintainers to discuss.

This series change the way HEST table offsets are calculated,
making them identical to what an OSPM would do and allowing
multiple HEST entries without causing migration issues. It open
space to add HEST support for non-arm architectures, as now
the number and type of HEST notification entries are not
hardcoded at ghes.c. Instead, they're passed as a parameter
from the arch-dependent init code.

With such issue addressed, it adds a new notification type and
add support to inject errors via a Python script. The script
itself is at the final patch.

v10:
- rebased on the top of current upstream:
  d9ce74873a6a ("Merge tag 'pull-vfio-20250611' of https://github.com/legoater/qemu into staging")
- solved a minor conflict

v9:
- backward compatibility logic moved to version 10.0;
- fixed a compilation issue with target/arm/kvm.c (probably
  caused by some rebase - funny enough, incremental 
  compilation was fine here);
- added two missing SPDX comments.

v8:
  - added a patch to revert recently-added changeset causing a
    conflict with these. All remaining patches are identical.

v7:
  - minor editorial change at the patch updating HEST doc spec
   with the new workflow

v6:
- some minor nits addressed:
   - use GPA instead of offset;
   - merged two patches;
   - fixed a couple of long line coding style issues;
   - the HEST/DSDT diff inside a patch was changed to avoid troubles
     applying it.

v5:
- make checkpatch happier;
- HEST table is now tested;
- some changes at HEST spec documentation to align with code changes;
- extra care was taken with regards to git bisectability.

v4:
- added an extra comment for AcpiGhesState structure;
- patches reordered;
- no functional changes, just code shift between the patches in this series.

v3:
- addressed more nits;
- hest_add_le now points to the beginning of HEST table;
- removed HEST from tests/data/acpi;
- added an extra patch to not use fw_cfg with virt-10.0 for hw_error_le

v2:
- address some nits;
- improved ags cleanup patch and removed ags.present field;
- added some missing le*_to_cpu() calls;
- update date at copyright for new files to 2024-2025;
- qmp command changed to: inject-ghes-v2-error ans since updated to 10.0;
- added HEST and DSDT tables after the changes to make check target happy.
  (two patches: first one whitelisting such tables; second one removing from
   whitelist and updating/adding such tables to tests/data/acpi)
