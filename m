I meant remove "-m" and remove QEMU_TEST_FLAKY_TESTS, instead replacing all
of them using --level.  Then migration-test ignores '-m' in the future
because it's simply not enough for us.

Yes how to treat flaky tests isn't important yet.  If we don't care about
QEMU_TEST_FLAKY_TESTS then we make it three levels.  The idea is the same.

Why the test runtime would be a different host versus whoever setup the
meson build?

This is true, but IIUC that's not a blocker, as we can use (btw, I found
fs.exists() a better alternative than my previous hack):

if fs.exists('/dev/kvm') and 'CONFIG_KVM' in config_all_accel
  has_kvm = true
else
  has_kvm = false
endif

We won't break it if we only switch to levels, right?

Btw, I also don't know why we need to.  IIRC the compat test runs the test
in previous release (but only feeds the new QEMU binary to the old
migration-test)?  I think that's one reason why we decided to use the old
migration-test (so we won't have new tests ran on compat tests, which is a
loss), just to avoid any change in migration-test will break the compat
test.. so I assume that should be fine regardless..
