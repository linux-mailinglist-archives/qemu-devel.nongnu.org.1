"Someone might not notice & screw up" is pretty much an argument for
not doing anything at all. We publish release notes to alert distros
to these kind of changes which is a reasonable effort on our part.
Distros need to play their part by reading them and adapting to the
changes. They can also compare the available options with new and
old QEMU to identify any new build features they need to handle when
updating.

Ultimately the DTC project has responsibility to not cause regressions
in new releases they issue, as is the case for any 3rd party dep that
we rely on.

We have CI jobs that can run on different distros. If we have coverage
of the boards in functional test suite that provides a way to validate the
operation with differing DTC versions as a sanity check.

Distributing pre-built binaries in source release tarballs is a long
standing issue with QEMU's releases. If we can eliminate the pre-bbuilt
DTB and only ship the source that is a good thing IMHO.

Are there any platforms that we target which still lack dtc ? The
submodule was there to plug gaps in distro support long ago, but
if every distro has dtc available the submodule is redundant.

With regards,
Daniel
