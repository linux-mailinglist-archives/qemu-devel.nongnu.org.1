They are not valid IDs, so they may get used in future for real
hardware of an entirely different type. We don't want these to
correspond to real hardware either because the aim is to test
out corners of the spec, so we may well implement completely different
sets of features to any real implementation.

Ah. I wasn't aware of the ID space reserved for QEMU or that doc.

We can leave the HiSilicon ones alone.  I'll sort a docs patch for
the 3 of those soon.

For the Intel ones can I have a pair for the root port and the CXL
type 3 device (so 2 IDs)?  We will probably need one shortly for
the type2 emulation test device as well.

Thanks,

Jonathan
