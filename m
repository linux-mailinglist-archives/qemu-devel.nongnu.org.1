I see. What is a bit confusing here is that the series consists in
one blob addition act (for the new test) and one blob update/removal act (after the fix).

Well, 2) won't make sense anymore since APIC.suffix would be already in the
whitelist in the previous patch that added the empty blobs. Since there won't
be a commit that adds _only_ the APIC.suffix to the whitelist, in preparation
for the fix, this info is "lost" in the series, even tho it's possible to
mention in the commit message.

Hence, what I think is not ideal from a maintainer's/reviewer's perspective,
is that in one commit all the blobs are updated/removed at once, which is
confusing because the fix did not touch the FACP table (for instance) and
this table is updated with APIC and with the removal of IORT, altogether,
in the last commit.

So, for this series, which adds new blobs and _also_ updates and removes some
of them, how about the following organization:

- Patch 1     : Add the new test, add the empty blobs *.suffix files, whitelist such a blobs
- Patch 2     : Update the blobs in Patch 1 with the ones that make the new test pass and remove them from the whitelist

- Patch 3     : Add the APIC.suffix blob to the whitelist (the table that changes due to the fix)
- Patch 4 - n : Fix(es)
- Patch (n+1) : Update the APIC.suffix blob, remove IORT.suffix blob, and remove the APIC.suffix blob from the whitelist
               * Add the APIC diff to the commit log
               * Mention in the commit log that IORT.suffix is removed because IORT table is no long generated after the fix

This way: a) no commit fails the test and b) blobs are added/updated/removed in separate commits

What do you think?


Cheers,
Gustavo
