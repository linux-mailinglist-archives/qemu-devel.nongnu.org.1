Yes, it's entirely by design. But it does create an extra hurdle in the
end. The event driven model requires metadata to inform the IO thread
what to do with the data collected (write to RAM at address X). The
other model doesn't require that as it has a payload already included,
so it just populates the fields. The problem is that we tied file
migration with !packets, but if we want to use iovs all around, we'd
still want packets (due to magic and version) although it'd be way
easier to collect the actual data in MultiFDRecvData instead of passing
information through the header and then doing the work at ->recv().

Good point. My rant means no demerit at all to the current design, I'm
just objectively pointing out the parts I think are getting in the way.

Point taken (on the HS as well).
