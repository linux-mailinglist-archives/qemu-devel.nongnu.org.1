We have recently discussed the approach internally. Our idea is to do
something similar to what you have done with MHSLD emulation, use shmem
dev to share information (mailbox???) between the two devices.

For this two hosts setup, for now I can see benefits,
the two hosts can have different kernel, that is to say, the one served
as FM only need to support for exmaple out-of-band communication with
the hardware (MCTP over i2c), and do not need to evolve with what we
want to test on the target host (boot with kernel with features we care).
That is very important at least for test purpose, as mctp over i2c
support for x86 support is not upstreamed yet, we do not want to rebase
whenever the kernel is updated.

More speficially, let's say, we deploy libcxlmi test framework on the FM
host, and then we can test the target host whatever features needed to
test (DCD etc). Again the FM host does not need to have dcd kernel support.

Compared to qmp interface, since libcxlmi already supports a lot of
commands and more commands are being included. It should be much more
convinient than implementing them with qmp interface.
