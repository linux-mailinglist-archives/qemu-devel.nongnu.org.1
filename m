I didn't realize at first that we're actually running this every time
a back trace is requested in the session. It feels fragile / risky to
be modifying the file repeatedly while QEMU has the orignal file open
so probably best to disregard that suggestion of mine.

None the less, that makes me even more wary of the full copyfile
approach, as we'd be taking that performance hit potentually many
times over :-(

I don't suppose there's an easy way to make a sparse copy of the
file such that we only include the minimum data needed to produce
the stack trace and omit other parts (leave all-zeros) ? 

With regards,
Daniel
