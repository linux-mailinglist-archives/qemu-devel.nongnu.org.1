I guess we need to update that comment ... we're been accepting "frozen" extensions as
stable (i.e. no need for the leading "x-") recently. It doesn't have to be ratified.

I've been talking with Drew about making 'max' the default CPU for riscv64. Users
that don't bother with any particular CPU can then use the most feature-rich CPU we
can provide by default. rv64 will still be around for people that wants more control,
although for real control of what the CPU is enabling or not I advise using rv64i or
even a profile CPU.

But anyway, as I said in an earlier reply, I don't mind enabling more defaults in rv64,
especially in a case where one extension have 3+ dependencies.
