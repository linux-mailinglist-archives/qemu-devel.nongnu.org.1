 From our build system point of view, I don't really see what is the 
difference. That's part of why I insisted previously on cleaning user vs 
system ifdefs at the same time we make files common, but the answer I 
had was "We don't need to do that now", so I stopped arguing.

When building user vs system, we use ifdef to detect this case, and we 
select different implementations and include a specific set of source 
files, the same way we do for some features, or specific targets. So, 
why should it be treated differently, or later?

In case we return a stub value by accident, when you expect to have a 
side effect done somewhere. And that it would not result in an immediate 
crash, but later at a random place.

Maybe the case just does not exist, but my point was that it does not 
cost anything to add an assert just in case.

Many, but not all of them I guess.

Sure, but as we saw, it's not always possible, because some calls are 
under: if (X_enabled()) {...do_X()...}, which requires to be able to 
link do_X even though it will be dead code at runtime.

Maybe my concern is unfounded, but seeing some of the inline stubs and 
the ifdefs associated, I hope we won't miss a corner case.
