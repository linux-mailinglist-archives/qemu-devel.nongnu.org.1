indeed, we don't really care for our current use case (and don't have
any other planned either, AFAIK), the bitmap is used only for the
duration of a single mirror, and always discarded at the end.

it was probably just done to mimic the backup interface, if that is not
desired, dropping it is probably a good idea.
