 ========
 
 Postcopy migration is currently not supported for VFIO devices.
+
+Multifd
+=======
+
+Starting from QEMU version 10.0 there's a possibility to transfer VFIO device
+_STOP_COPY state via multifd channels. This helps reduce downtime - especially
+with multiple VFIO devices or with devices having a large migration state.
+As an additional benefit, setting the VFIO device to _STOP_COPY state and
+saving its config space is also parallelized (run in a separate thread) in
+such migration mode.
+
+The multifd VFIO device state transfer is controlled by
+"x-migration-multifd-transfer" VFIO device property. This property defaults to
+AUTO, which means that VFIO device state transfer via multifd channels is
+attempted in configurations that otherwise support it.
+
+Since the target QEMU needs to load device state buffers in-order it needs to
+queue incoming buffers until they can be loaded into the device.
+This means that a malicious QEMU source could theoretically cause the target
+QEMU to allocate unlimited amounts of memory for such buffers-in-flight.
+
+The "x-migration-max-queued-buffers" property allows capping the maximum count
+of these VFIO device state buffers queued at the destination.
+
+Because a malicious QEMU source causing OOM on the target is not expected to be
+a realistic threat in most of VFIO live migration use cases and the right value
+depends on the particular setup by default this queued buffers limit is
+disabled by setting it to UINT64_MAX.
+
+Some host platforms (like ARM64) require that VFIO device config is loaded only
+after all iterables were loaded.
+Such interlocking is controlled by "x-migration-load-config-after-iter" VFIO
+device property, which in its default setting (AUTO) does so only on platforms
+that actually require it.
