We have no way of knowing whether there are existing users of this, or
any other feature in QEMU. This is why we have a formal deprecation
period, rather than immediately deleting existing features.

Yes, there are plenty of reasons why this feature is sub-optimal, but
it is not broken to the extent that it is *impossible* for people to
be using it.

IOW, I don't see that there's anything special here to justify bypassing
our deprecation process here.

Daniel
