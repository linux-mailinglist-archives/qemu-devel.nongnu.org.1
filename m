+1 to both points

That's aren't VM scope though, which this topic is about.
But yes, the same tools as on baremetal can collect data and send/aggregate
them elsewhere. The main point from VM perspective is act just like baremetal
systems so the same monitoring tools could be reused.

For NVF usecase, I also was eyeing pmda-denki.

How hard it would be to add MSR based sampling to denki?
Can we borrow Anthony's MSR sampling from
qemu-vmsr-helper, to reduce amount of work needed.

Also, for guest per vCPU accounting, we would need per thread
accounting (which I haven't noticed from a quick look at denki).
So some effort would be needed to add it there.  

I didn't know about pmda-lmsensors, I guess we should be able to use
it out of box with 'acpi power meter' sensor, if QEMU were to provide such.
I've also seen denki supporting battery power sensor, we can abuse that
and make QEMU provide that, but I'd rather add 'acpi power meter' sensor
to denki (which to some degree intersects with battery power sensor
functionality).

PS:
In this series Anthony uses custom protocol to get data from
privileged MSR helper to QEMU. Would it be acceptable?
Or is there a preferred way for PCP to do inter-process comms?
