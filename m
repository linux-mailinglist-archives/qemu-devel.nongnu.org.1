I think that

net dump: can't open random-filename: because of some error

shows better where to look for the problem than just

Could not open 'random-filename': because of some error

as the latter does not tell where the file name comes from or what is it. 
It could be added by a management application or added by the users 
randomly without really knowing what they are doing so repeating the 
option or part in the message that the error comes from can help to find 
out where to correct it. Otherwise it might be difficult to guess what 
random-filename is related to if it's not named something you'd expect.
