I agree, it would make sense for QEMU to map fid to FD+O_PATH.  That
would avoid the kind of issues you mentioned.

Christian, Greg, what do you think?

Yes, I think it would make sense for Landlock to open and keep open a
fid (and hopefully the related remote file).  However, the v9fs umount
should be handled gracefully the same way Landlock tag inodes are
handled.  This should come with a QEMU patch to fix the consistency
issue.

Anyway, if QEMU does it, wouldn't it be the same for Landlock to just
rely on fid?  If QEMU uses FD+O_PATH, then Landlock would work even for
server-moved files.
