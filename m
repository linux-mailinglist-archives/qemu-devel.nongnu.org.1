I think 'simulated' was indeed a badly chosen name because the series,
as read it, is merely saving the hotplugged/unplugged vCPU states to the
ACPI for persistence and later restoration, so I think s/simulated/saved/ is
reasonable here, i.e., ACPI now reflects the vCPU states after hotplug/unplug.
QEMU manipulates the ACPI tables and methods to reflect the machine config.
and this series is essentially doing the same. Why that's not ok?


Cheers,
Gustavo
