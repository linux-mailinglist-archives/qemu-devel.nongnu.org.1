Yes, and consistency is always desirable.  But let's have a look at the
new interface in isolation, to see whether it's actually good.

As is, query-iothreads tells us "the weight factor for adaptive polling
is X, and it was set by the user", or "the weight factor for adaptive
polling was not set by the user, but picked by the system."

If we returned the actual value, it would tell us "the weight factor for
adaptive polling is X".  

Only the former interface tells us whether the user or the system
picked.

Only the latter interface tells us what the system picked.

Which one is useful in practice?

I'd argue the latter.  A management application knows whether it set a
value without query-iothreads' help, but it doesn't know what the system
picked.  The people coding it may know if a contract specifies what the
system picks (see below).

If we conclude that returning the actual value is better for new
@poll-weight, then it would surely be better for @poll-grow and
@poll-shrink, too.  Could we still improve them?

Libvirt developers, any advice?

I understand that you're mirroring how @poll-grow and @poll-shrink work,
but let's ignore that for a minute.

Compare four possible interfaces:

1. Optional @poll-weight defaults to 2.  Values <= 0 are rejected.

2. Optional @poll-weight defaults to 2.  Value 0 is replaced by the
   default value 2.  Values < 0 are rejected.

3. Optional @poll-weight defaults to 0.  Values < 0 are rejected.  Value
   0 makes the system pick a value, namely 2.

4. Optional @poll-weight defaults to 0.  Values < 0 are rejected.  Value
   0 makes the system pick a value.  It currently picks 2.

The difference between 3. and 4. is that 3. makes "system picks 2" part
of the contract, while 4. doesn't.

1. is the simplest.  Is 2.'s additional complexity worthwhile?  3.'s?
4.'s?
