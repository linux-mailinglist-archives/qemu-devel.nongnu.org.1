It should be a bug (and I remember we disabled vhost when the patches
were merged). Have you tested it in a guest to see if it can see RSC
when vhost is enabled?

I suspect we need to add the RSC bit into current kernel_feature_bits:

/* Features supported by host kernel. */
static const int kernel_feature_bits[] =3D {
    VIRTIO_F_NOTIFY_ON_EMPTY,
    VIRTIO_RING_F_INDIRECT_DESC,
    VIRTIO_RING_F_EVENT_IDX,
    VIRTIO_NET_F_MRG_RXBUF,
    VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1,
    VIRTIO_NET_F_MTU,
    VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM,
    VIRTIO_F_RING_PACKED,
    VIRTIO_F_RING_RESET,
    VIRTIO_NET_F_HASH_REPORT,
    VHOST_INVALID_FEATURE_BIT
};

As RSC won't be provided by TUN/TAP anyhow.

True, technically, vDPA can fallback to SVQ, but it's another topic.
