In the codebase, we always use this type as an opaque type (through 
pointer, using library functions to interact with it and never use it's 
size). So the fact we see a different layout is *not* an issue for QEMU. 
I don't see it as a counter example that this does not work.

-mms-bitfields is already the (silent) gcc default on windows, to mimic 
MSVC behaviour. Yes, it would be preferable to use this default and 
gcc_struct attribute, but right now, it does not work with clang. So the 
whole point is to accept a compromise for this.
We can even apply this selectively when clang is detected in case QEMU 
community is scared changing this default would break existing code.

I don't understand the strong pushback against clang support on windows. 
Because of a "theoretical" problem, that was proved here we don't have 
currently, we are stuck with gcc_struct attribute. This is currently 
blocking clang, and I don't see the point about that.
If clang supports gcc_struct attribute in the future, we can always 
decide to revert this change, and use it again. Meanwhile (1 month? 1 
year? 5 years?), we are just blocking progress support for the sake of 
blocking it.
The risk of this approach is that MSYS2, and Google folks using clang-cl 
will simply move forward and remove this restriction, even if the 
upstream community does not agree. Closing eyes and say "not supported" 
is not the best way to move forward.

It does not only remove gcc_struct attribute, it replaces it with an 
option that does the same thing globally for all packed structs.

I did the experiment with gcc only, simply to have an easier diff 
because code layout stays the same, while clang would order symbols 
differently.
