That can't be expressed in a property in the device.

Consider the virtio-net device.  The backend transfer is only
possible of the virtio-net is associated with a netdev using
the vhost-user backend, and the vhost-user backend must be
using a chardev with a socket backend, and the socket backend
must not have TLS or websockets enabled.

Migratability of the backend requires an API against the
NetClientInfo object, which will in turn require calling
out to an API against the Chardv object.

Daniel
