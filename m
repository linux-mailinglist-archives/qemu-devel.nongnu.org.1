Brian focussed on shutdown in his message because that is the scenario
he's seeing right now, but you're right that shutdown probably isn't
that bad and once we unmount the exported image, we can properly shut
down things on the QEMU side, too.

The more challenging part is that sometimes QEMU needs to quiesce an
export so that no new requests can be processed for a short time. Maybe
we're switching processing to a different iothread or something like
this. In this scenario, we don't actually want to unmount the image, but
just cancel any outstanding COMMIT_AND_FETCH request, and soon after
submit a new one to continue processing requests.

If it's impossible to cancel the request in the kernel and queue new
request for a little bit (I suppose it would look a bit like userspace
being completely busy processing hypothetical NOP requests), we would
have to introduce some indirections in userspace to handle the case that
CQEs may be posted at times when we don't want to process them, or even
in the ring of the wrong thread (each iothread in QEMU has it's own
io_uring instance).

Come to think of it, the next thing the user may want to do might even
be deleting the old thread, which would have to fail while it's still
busy. So I think we do need a way to get rid of requests that it started
and can't just wait until they are used up.

Kevin
