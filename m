Right, the intent is that any copyrightable portion of a commit must
not have come directly from an AI/LLM tool, or from an agent which
indirectly/internally uses an AI/LLM tool.

"code generator" is possibly a little overly specific, as this is really
about any type of tool which emits content that will make its way into
qemu.git, whether code or non-code content (docs, images, etc).

Mostly yes - there's a fuzzy boundary in the debug/analyze use cases,
if the tool is also suggesting code changes to fix issues.

If the scope of the suggested changes meets the threshold for being
(likely) copyrightable code, that would fall under the policy.

With regards,
Daniel
