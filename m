Then, I think I agree with you, it would seem that this approach
naturally solved the issue with address translation among different
devices, as they all get the most up-to-date memory table after each
mmap.

WDYT, @Stefan Hajnoczi ?
If we are unsure, maybe we can leave the MEM_READ/WRITE support as a
later extension, and try to integrate the rest of this patch first.
