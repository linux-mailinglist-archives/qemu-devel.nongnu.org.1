In the end, if we implement something to modify running code, we should 
make sure it works as expected (flushing the related tb). I am not sure 
about the current status, and all the changes that would be needed, but 
it's something we should discuss before implementing.

More globally, let's wait to hear feedback from maintainers to see if 
they are open to the idea or not. A "hard" no would end it there.

We have been discussing something like that for system mode recently, so 
it would definitely be useful.

IMHO, it's open for anyone to contribute this, the plugins area is not a 
private garden where only chosen ones can change things. Just be 
prepared for change requests, and multiple versions before the final one.

Same on this one, we'll see if maintainers are ok with the idea.
