Looking at your branch I see the following series (marked with cover-letter)
*

  *

    cover-letter: Add RMR WAR for MSI mappings (based on former RMR flat
    mapping and not related to *[PATCH RFCv1 0/7] vfio: Allow userspace
    to specify the address for each MSI vector
    <https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/cover.1731130093.git.nicolinc@nvidia.com/#r>
    I guess)*

  *

    cover-letter: hw/arm/virt: Add multiple nested SMMUs (Nicolin ->
    Shameer)

  *

    cover-letter: Add HW accelerated nesting support for arm SMMUv3
    (Nicolin)

  *

    cover-letter: Add VIOMMU infrastructure support (Nicolin)

  *

    cover-letter: intel_iommu: Enable stage-1 translation for
    passthrough device (Zhenzhong)

  *

    cover-letter: intel_iommu: Enable stage-1 translation for emulated
    device (Zhenzhong)

The last one is covered by *[PATCH v5 00/20] intel_iommu: Enable stage-1
translation for emulated device
<https://lore.kernel.org/all/20241111083457.2090664-1-zhenzhong.duan@intel.com/#r>
*

*I see there is a reference to *"Enable stage-1 translation for
passthrough device" series but has it been posted for review? Adding
Zhenzhong in copy.

**

*Are there any posts upstream for the rest, besides Shameer's respin?

Can you point us to the actual series including this IOMMU_HWPT_ALLOC
support? This would clarify which part you are going to work on next.

can you clarify what you call backend API in that context?

So we have started the multi smmu instantiation review and provided
feedbacks.
Which part can we work on then?

Thanks
