Interesting. Do you have a more specific version for that?
I had a look at various 2.x Linux OHCI drivers but they all seem to do
zero-length packets "by the spec" with CBP=3DBE=3D0. eg 2.6.39.4:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v2.6.39.4/source/drivers/usb/host/ohci-q.c=
#L539
and there's no hardware-quirk handling to do it differently on
some controllers. (The USB OHCI driver seems to have gone through
a couple of rewrites in the 2.x kernel timeframe; the earlier 2.3.51
version does the TD fill here:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/2.3.51/source/drivers/usb/usb-ohci.c#L812
and again it handles zero length as BE=3DCBP=3D0.)

> But I only have a test case I created myself, and am not an expert on com=
puter history here. I think "be liberal in what you accept, by conservative=
 in what you send" applies when I don't know which historical OSes, if any,=
 need this behavior. I think the behavior of actual hardware weighs more he=
avily since that *is* available and testable. Are there additional checks t=
hat would expand on what's known about actual ohci hw?

The other side of the argument is "if in doubt and you don't
know of any concrete problem being caused, don't change
working code". If there are any historical OSes that rely on
being able to send zero packets with be=3Dcbp-1 for some nonzero
be, and anybody wants to run them on QEMU, then presumably they
can send us a bug report saying "XYZ's USB support doesn't work".
That nobody has ever does this is evidence on the side of
"there is no such OS out there, everybody writing an OHCI driver
read the spec and made their driver send zero length packets the
way the spec very clearly says you should". Please correct me
if I'm wrong, but my interpretation of your helpful explanation
above is that this is essentially a theoretical problem rather
than one that's caused you a problem you need to fix.

thanks
