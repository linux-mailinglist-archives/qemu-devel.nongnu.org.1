Yes, as mentioned before I would like you to take changes you disagree
with, at least once we have discussed alternatives and I'm sure that's
the way I want to go. It would save a lot of grief if you could do
that.

I could use your contrib/ repo but there isn't a lot of point, since I
have to have my own tree anyway, due to rejected / changes-requested
patches. It's just lots of fiddling around for no gain. I'm fine with
your not having the scripts in your tree and I'm fine with maintaining
the Python tools in my tree. Basically it seems my tree is the dumping
ground for the stuff you don't want in 'pure U-Boot', or don't want
yet. If you would like me to sync my scripts to the contrib/ tree
every now and then, yes I can do that. I don't see much point since we
can't reference them in docs or test them in CI, but I'm willing to do
it.

But I do want to post patches so I can get feedback from people who
are interested. Perhaps we could set up an 'experimental' mailing list
for that, since you seem really unhappy when I send them to the U-Boot
mailing list?

Re your 'good faith' thing, I'm really just trying to make progress
and I wish there was less 'email overhead' and more action. If you
have concerns, it would be better to discuss a resolution f2f or on a
VC, not endless email threads which don't relate to the patches I'm
sending. The series we are discussing here was sent in 2021 based on
bloblist from 2018! [1]. It is why Firmware Handoff happened. Give me
some credit for foresight, at least.

Regards,
Simon
