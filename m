You are too nice to those firmware folk ;)  How will they learn!

Everything in default node is fine.  I don't much like the having
broken normal numa setup combined with CXL trying to carry on with
its node. I suspect that will be fragile in the long run.

numa_off and other things set in that path tend to spread there wings
into surprising places and broken / missing SRAT + CXL is something
that isn't likely to get much testing.
