Define "notice a difference" :)  More on that below.

Makes sense to me.

To be precise: conditionals that use macros restricted to
target-specific code, i.e. the ones poisoned by exec/poison.h.  Let's
call them target-specific QAPI conditionals.

The QAPI generator is blissfully unaware of all this.

The build system treats QAPI modules qapi/*-target.json as
target-specific.  The .c files generated for them are compiled per
target.  See qapi/meson.build.

Only such target-specific modules can can use target-specific QAPI
conditionals.  Use in target-independent modules will generate C that
won't compile.

Poisoned macros used in qapi/*-target.json:

    CONFIG_KVM
    TARGET_ARM
    TARGET_I386
    TARGET_LOONGARCH64
    TARGET_MIPS
    TARGET_PPC
    TARGET_RISCV
    TARGET_S390X

You're trying to eliminate target-specific QAPI conditionals.  Correct?

This affects QAPI/QMP introspection, i.e. the value of query-qmp-schema.

Management applications can no longer use introspection to find out
whether target-specific things are available.

For instance, query-cpu-definitions is implemented for targets arm,
i386, loongarch, mips, ppc, riscv, and s390x.  It initially was for
fewer targets, and more targets followed one by one.  Still more may
follow in the future.  Right now, management applications can use
introspection to find out whether it is available.  That stops working
when you make it available for all targets, stubbed out for the ones
that don't (yet) implement it.

Management applications may have to be adjusted for this.

This is not an attempt to shoot down your approach.  I'm merely
demonstrating limitations of your promise "if anyone notices a
difference, it will be a bug."

Now, we could get really fancy and try to keep introspection the same by
applying conditionals dynamically somehow.  I.e. have the single binary
return different introspection values depending on the actual guest's
target.

This requires fixing the target before introspection.  Unless this is
somehow completely transparent (wrapper scripts, or awful hacks based on
the binary's filename, perhaps), management applications may have to be
adjusted to actually do that.

Applies not just to introspection.  Consider query-cpu-definitions
again.  It currently returns CPU definitions for *the* target.  What
would a single binary's query-cpu-definitions return?  The CPU
definitions for *all* its targets?  Management applications then receive
CPUs that won't work, which may upset them.  To avoid noticable
difference, we again have to fix the target before we look.

Of course, "fixing the target" stops making sense once we move to
heterogeneous machines with multiple targets.

For better or worse, generated documentation always contains everything.

An argument could be made for stripping out documentation for the stuff
that isn't included in this build.

I'm not sure what you mean by "to limit qmp commands visible".

QAPI/QMP introspection has all commands and events, and all types
reachable from them.  query-qmp-schema returns an array, where each
array element describes one command, event, or type.  When a command,
event, or type is conditional in the schema, the element is wrapped in
the #if generated for the condition.

Yes, if we can find acceptable solutions for the problems that come with
it.

Maybe.

I'm throwing in devel@lists.libvirt.org.
