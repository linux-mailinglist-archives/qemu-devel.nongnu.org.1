Yes, I agree once more it's still a fair ask, it's just not the major way
we do it in QEMU upstream otherwise there's no point introducing versioned
machine types (while we still need things like pc/q35 to identify the
boards even if no versioning on each of them).

With per-device properties, maybe.. it's still feasible to qom-list the
devices on both src/dst to know whether both of them would support this,
then turning it on if qom-list can report the property on both sides.  I
didn't think deeper than that, though..

Fabiano is looking at something like that, we called it migration
handshake.

https://wiki.qemu.org/ToDo/LiveMigration#Migration_handshake

Fundamentally one of its goal is that we can have bi-directional "talks"
between src/dst, before migration ever started, to synchronize on things
like this.  It's still likely not gonna happen this release.. though..  but
it's on the radar.  With that, dst also doesn't need to set migration
caps/params the same as src, because they'll talk things over.
