post_save calls do succeed in general.
Now, we are introducing the post_save_errp() function which is an alternative to the
post_save() call. We are adding the feature to catch errors in Error object,
thereby clearly considering the case where post_save_erp can go wrong.
So we have already deviated from the old design that all post_save operations are
infalliable cleaup routines. The only catch is, these alternate functions are introduced
a couple of commits later.

If that is the case, then we need to handle both the errors, and propagate only
the most significant (which in my opinion is the post_save) one.

In other words, the reasoning for 1, 
	1) Proceeding errors were propagated before, but they are now dismissed.

is that,
a failure during the preceeding operation means that we failed in saving the state
but a failure during the post-save call, means that we failed in cleanup or restoring
back the system to a stable state, which is a more serious one, because it may lead to
the system being in an inconsistent state.
Can I write something on these lines, to justify the change?

I am sorry, I could not completely understand the part, where you mentioned that
we need to have 2 callbacks; I am assuming you are mentioning something like try..catch,
finally blocks from the other languages. 
post_save (that can not raise an error) being called in the goto block.

So if the main operation fails, we say goto cleanup, and then execute post_save which always
succeeds. If the main operation succeeds then we call post_save that can raise an error. Please correct
me if I am wrong.
