I'll comment on a few examples above, which I think some of them, even if
handshake is ready, may still need mgmt layers to involve..

Multifd and postcopy are the two major features, and they, IMHO, all better
need user involvements..

Multifd needs it because it relies on the channel being able to provide >1
channels.  It means "| nc XXX > file" can stop working if we turn it on by
default silently.

We also see generic use case in containers now that when there're dedicated
cores for vcpus and "no dedicate" / "one" core setup for qemu hypervisor
threads, it means anything like multifd or even block layer iothreads can
be pure overheads comparing to one thread / one channel does the job.. in
those cases they're better disabled.

Postcopy, when enabled manually like right now, has one benefit I can think
of: when the user will 100% use postcopy, the failure can happen earlier if
dest host doesn't even support it!

So it'll generate an error upfront saying "postcopy not supported" before
migration starts, comparing to fail later at migrate_start_postcopy, then
fail that command, but maybe if so the user may not even start the
migration at all, knowing workload too busy to converge.

It's pretty common that postcopy is not supported on dest due to the fact
that people are over cautious on what userfault could do (which I kind of
agree.. it's a tricky but powerful feature), so unprivileged_userfaultfd=0
knob alone can disable it for many hosts, afaiu.. simply because kvm will
be the default accel, and qemu needs kernel fault trapping capability to
make postcopy work.. which requires unprivileged userfaults that qemu
process may not have.

Maybe the postcopy-preempt mode is the one closest to what we can enable by
default, so if it's not a capability we could auto-enalbe it with/without
handshake being there.  However there's still the tricky part where it
starts to require >1 channels, so if it's the default it could break anyone
who has a proxy after the socket, for example, iff the proxy only supports
one channel.. similar to multifd, but not completely the same.

Mapped-ram, definitely needs user involvements, because it will change the
image layout.

So.. just to say, maybe we'll still need some mgmt help to explicitly
enable many of the features after the handshake work, as the mgmt knows
better on what is the context of the VM, rather than risking qemu default
configs to fail on some existing but working setups.  Though at least
libvirt will only need to set caps/params only once for each migration.

Thanks,
