Yes, that's the result of review feedback to the early iterations of
my series. Specifically, (1) a limit is needed to prevent rogue guests
from hogging unlimited amounts of memory and (2) global parameters are
frowned upon. Setting a suitable limit is much more practical when
targeted at a given device/driver combination.
