We still have instance_finalize that will fire when the MR's refcount 
gets zero so it has its own use cases.

For this particular topic I have somewhat a strong opinion that we 
should care the two reference counters.

Indeed, dealing with two reference counters is not fun, but sometimes it 
is necessary to do reference counting correctly. Your patch is to avoid 
reference counting for tracking dependencies among regions with the same 
owner, and it does so by ignoring the reference from container to subregion.

I prefer to keep reference counting correct instead of having an 
additional ad-hoc measure that breaks reference relationships.
