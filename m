You can't do deep links into the Coverity Scan UI, but if you
want to ask for an account at https://scan.coverity.com/projects/qemu
we generally give them to any developer who asks.

In this case 1558459 is complaining about the call to
     riscv_pmu_update_fixed_ctrs(env, newpriv, virt_en);
in riscv_cpu_set_mode(), and 1558462 is complaining about the call to
 riscv_cpu_set_mode(env, PRV_M, virt)
in riscv_cpu_do_interrupt().

So it's basically reported the same problem twice, at different
levels in the callstack. I don't know why it's done that, but it's
not that uncommon that the same problem gets detected several ways.

The complaints about get_field/set_field were different: those were
1558461, 1558463. I've already marked those as false-positives in the UI.

(Generally my practice is that where we think there's no point in
making a change to QEMU's code I mark the issue as a false-positive;
where we think it is reasonable to make a change to QEMU's code
(e.g. to aid the human reader or where we think an assert() is useful)
I leave it marked as "bug" to indicate we want to change something,
even if Coverity's analysis is wrong and it's a can't-happen case.)

thanks
