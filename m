For understanding the MacOS side of things, I have been consulting

As far as I can tell, the documentation is implying that somewhere between
the driver and the physical hardware, *something* must keep track of the
gamma table (even if indirectly by subsequently applying it to the palette
table) to map the raw framebuffer data to gamma-corrected colors.

This is very much of interest! Thank you. I am hoping to continue to use
the mac99 machine type, but this code is a useful reference.

The most basic support requires cscGetGamma and cscSetGamma to at least
return success:
https://github.com/cebix/macemu/commit/2676e1bd134703d888788c682fb56e07b5cf=
56a9
The patch to SheepShaver was small because most of the functionality was
already present, albeit dead code.

Surprisingly, github can't deal with CR line endings, so I can't (easily)
link to some of the code to cite it:
https://github.com/ozbenh/QemuMacDrivers/blob/master/shared/MacDriverUtils.=
c

Once the gamma table is saved, it's "applied" by cscSetEntries to combine a
color palette and gamma table into the "real" color. QemuMacDrivers does
not seem to keep track of the palette at all, sending it upstream to the
driver by calling this function in a loop:

OSStatus QemuVga_SetColorEntry(UInt32 index, RGBColor *color)
{
VgaWriteB(0x3c8, index);
VgaWriteB(0x3c9, color->red >> 8);
VgaWriteB(0x3c9, color->green >> 8);
VgaWriteB(0x3c9, color->blue >> 8);
return noErr;
}

VgaWriteB seems to be doing MMIO to write those values upstream.

Similarly, mac_qfb_driver seems to use MMIO to write back both the palette
table and the gamma table to the driver, saving neither one in emulated
driver state:
https://github.com/SolraBizna/mac_qfb_driver/blob/e78ba4ccd08d254a10bad7c13=
d90810b17dbfd87/src/control.cc#L48-L62

I'm not sure where either driver's MMIO is received on the qemu end. At
least in SheepShaver, that gamma table is indeed used in the cscSetEntries
handler to create the true color mapping handed to its video driver:
https://github.com/cebix/macemu/blob/96e512bd6376e78a2869f16dcc8a9028bce5ee=
72/SheepShaver/src/video.cpp#L299-L320

If mac_qfb_driver is, as indicated in its README, able to interoperate with
an unpatched qemu, that makes me think that *potentially* qemu itself
doesn't need to be patched, depending on what qemu-side code any driver is
sending its MMIO to.

I have an article on AmigaOS gfx here:

I'm continuing to read this now.

Thanks already, y'all.
