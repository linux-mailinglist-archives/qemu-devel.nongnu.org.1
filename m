From: Peter Maydell <peter.maydell@linaro.org>

In commit bd0da3a3d4f we changed make-release so that instead of
cloning every git submodule of EDK2 we only cloned a fixed list.
The original motivation for this was that one of the submodules:
 * was from a non-github repo
 * that repo had a "SSL certificate expired" failure
 * wasn't actually needed for the set of EDK2 binaries we build
and at the time we were trying to build the EDK2 binaries in one of
our CI jobs.

Unfortunately this change meant that we were exposed to bugs where
EDK2 adds a new submodule and the sources we ship in the release
tarball won't build any more.  In particular, in EDK2 commit
c6bb7d54beb05 the MipiSysTLib submodule was added, causing failure of
the ROM build in our tarball starting from QEMU release 8.2.0:

/tmp/qemu-10.0.0/roms/edk2/MdePkg/MdePkg.dec(32): error 000E: File/directory not found in workspace
        Library/MipiSysTLib/mipisyst/library/include is not found in packages path:
        /tmp/qemu-10.0.0/roms/.
        /tmp/qemu-10.0.0/roms/edk2

(Building from a QEMU git checkout works fine.)

In the intervening time EDK2 moved the submodule that had a problem
to be one they mirrored themselves (and at time of writing all their
submodules are hosted on github), and we stopped trying to build
EDK2 binaries in our own CI jobs with commit 690ceb71936f9037f6.

Go back to cloning every EDK2 submodule, so we don't have an
untested explicit list of submodules which will break without
our noticing it.

This increases the size of the QEMU tarball .tar.xz file from
133M to 139M in my testing.
