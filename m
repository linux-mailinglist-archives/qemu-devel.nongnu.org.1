I had a conversation about this on IRC a week or so back (though I
forget who with, sorry) that made me realise there's a problem with this
approach, and I wanted to write that up for the mailing list.

The problem with turning this into a memory-backed device rather than
an MMIO backed device is that it breaks KVM on Arm CPUs which don't
have FEAT_S2FWB (i.e. anything older than Armv8.4). This is because
without FEAT_S2FWB the guest and host will disagree about the memory
attributes of the region:
 * the host knows this is RAM backed and it's normal-cacheable
   (certainly as far as the mapping that QEMU itself has)
 * the guest thinks it's real hardware device registers and maps it
   as Device
The resulting mismatch in cacheability attributes can cause unexpected
behaviour where the guest and QEMU views of the memory contents don't
necessarily match up. (This is the same underlying issue that means
that you can't use QEMU devices that emulate VGA framebuffers on
AArch64 KVM without FEAT_S2FWB.)

With FEAT_S2FWB the problem goes away because the hypervisor can
override the guest's specified memory attributes to get rid of
the attribute mismatch.

So given that this would cause a regression for KVM, my preference
is to stick with the current "the device is backed by MMIO read
and write functions in the normal way". If a particular guest is
trying to access it with LDP/STP that is best fixed in the guest.

Potentially we could emulate (interpret) some subset of complex
load/store insns in QEMU at the point where we get the "took a
data abort but no syndrome information". This ought to be doable
in a way that's shareable between hvf and KVM, and we can write
a decodetree file for the insns we want to interpret. (I would
not try to share with TCG decodetree, though the patterns can
probably be copied across.)
