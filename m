Right, maybe I should write that in the commit message and 
documentation.

Yep, I see.

`O_CREAT | O_EXCL` should provide just this behavior.
 From shm_open(3) manpage:

     O_EXCL  If O_CREAT was also specified, and a shared memory object
             with the given name already exists, return an error.  The
             check for the existence of the object, and its creation if
             it does not exist, are performed atomically.

Right. It's a name that will only "appear" in the system for a very 
short time since we call shm_unlink() right after shm_open(). So I just 
need the unique name to prevent several QEMUs launched at the same time 
from colliding with the name.

Exactly! I can clarify this in the commit description as well.

Thanks for the helpful comments!
If there is anything I need to change for v3, please tell me ;-)
