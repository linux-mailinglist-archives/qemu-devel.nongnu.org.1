Hi Ewan,

By this patch:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20250620092734.1576677-14-zhao1.liu@intel.com/

I fixed the 0x80000005 leaf for Intel and Zhaoxin based on your feedback
by the way.

It looks like the unified cache_info would be very compatible with
various vendor needs and corner cases. So I'll respin this series based
on that cache_info series.

Before sending the patch, I was thinking that maybe I could help you
rebase and include your Yongfeng cache model patch you added into my v2
series, or you could rebase and send it yourself afterward. Which way do
you like?

And for TLB, we can wait and see what maintainers think. Maybe it is
possible, considering that the cache also transitioned from hardcoding
to a cache model (since commit 7e3482f82480).

Thanks,
Zhao
