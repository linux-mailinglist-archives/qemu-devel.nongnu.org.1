Hi Peter,

For these specific devices (the fixed memory windows) there isn't
any state as they are representing fixed configuration of the system.
The state is all in the host bridges and beyond. I'll add
a comment as you suggest.

Currently CXL emulation is completely broken wrt to migration and
there are some known issues for reset as well. Both are on the list
of things to fix. Migration is less important as the only current use
for this stuff is running software stack test cases and for that
migration isn't currently of interest - that will change for some
of the virtualization related work that is just getting started.
The reset thing needs more work for devices as we've tripped over
a few corner cases triggered by people rebooting the guest and device
state not being fully cleared.  On top of that we have a complex
nest of device reset types to cover at some point as some registers
are sticky over some types of reset.

Jonathan
