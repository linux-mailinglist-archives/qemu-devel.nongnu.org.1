I didn't think of it in that way. This makes sense now.

Understood. Thank you for the clarification.

Oh, I thought, from figure 6, the bitmap is a part of QEMU's memory but is
separate from the guest's memory.

Understood, I won't go off on a tangent in that case.

Got it. I'll take a look at "hw/virtio/virtio.c".

I'll set up this environment as well.
