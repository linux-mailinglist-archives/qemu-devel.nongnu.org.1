I have rewritten the documentation section to make it more explicit
that the reset might not happen. I would appreciate feedback if some
part still needs some care or if it is clear now.

  If the machine supports waking up from a suspended state and needs to
  reset its devices during wake-up (from ``MachineClass::wakeup()``
  method), this reset type should be used for such a request. Devices
  can utilize this reset type to differentiate the reset requested
  during machine wake-up from other reset requests. For example, a
  virtio-mem device must not unplug its memory blocks during wake-up as
  the contents of the guest RAM would get lost. However, this reset type
  should not be used for wake-up detection, as not every machine type
  issues a device reset request during wake-up.
