I think exposing flexibility in vendor CPUs just creates confusion.

As a user if I start QEMU with "-cpu company-cpu" then I am expecting
to get an emulation of company-cpu.

I think that makes sense.

I think we can be pretty strict on profiles options. To me it seems
reasonable to say a user can enable **one** profile. Once that profile
is enabled they get all of those extensions.

If possible/simple we can then allow them to manually enable and/or
disable extensions on top of that. I don't see any use in allowing
users to turn profiles "off" though. I'm not even clear what that
means.
