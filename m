It is possible to have another type that inherits TYPE_OBJECT_COMPAT and 
does the second half.

Theoretically, there may also be a call of object_apply_compat_props() 
that has some dependency on its state in the future, but such a future 
concern should be treated later; I'll focus on existing callers of 
object_apply_compat_props() and global_props() in the following 
discussion too.

Yes, that's my conclusion so far, but please see below for the explanation:

Avoiding providing post_init() hooks is a nice concrete explanation of 
the goal.

That said, the migration object provides post_init() hooks anyway, so 
the question will be if avoiding post_init() hooks will simplify the 
existing callers of object_apply_compat_props().

Looking into the codebase, there are four users of 
object_apply_compat_props(); hostmem, qdev, accel, and sev. Only hostmem 
and qdev call object_apply_compat_props() in their post_init() hooks, 
and qdev needs the hook anyway for the same reason the migration object 
does.

So there is only one post_init() hook added for 
object_apply_compat_props(): host_memory_backend_post_init(). And even 
this can be simplified; since object_apply_compat_props() and the hook 
has the same signature, hostmem can simply do:

.instance_post_init = object_apply_compat_props,

... and drop host_memory_backend_post_init().

This is much simpler than adding the object-compat type, so probably 
it's too early to add the type.
