Hi Mattias,

I was wondering what the status of this patch set is - seems no outstanding issues
have been raised?

I'd run into a similar problem with multiple DMA mappings using the bounce buffer
when using the emulated CXL memory with virtio-blk-pci accessing it.

In that particular case virtio-blk is using the "memory" address space, but
otherwise your first 2 patches work for me as well so I'd definitely like
to see those get merged!

Thanks,

Jonathan
