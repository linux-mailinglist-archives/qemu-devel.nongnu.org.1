If I understand correctly, _this_ unref(lstnr) is NOT the final
reference, because of the additional reference still owned by the
GSource that is still dispatching, so finalize(lstnr) is not reached
here...

...but instead here.  And that is the desirable property of the
pre-patch behavior with a per-GSource reference on the listsner object
- we are guaranteed that listener can't be finalized while there are
any pending dispatch in flight, even if the caller has unref'd their
last mention of lstnr, and therefore the dispatch never has a
use-after-free.

Yes, that's the race I plugged between v1 and v2 by adding the
referencing around the client callback.

Another copy-paste problem?  I think your argument is that if we lose
this race, this particular unref() drops the count to 0 triggering
finalize() early...

...before this one can compensate, and thus having a UAF for a
finalized lstnr passed to the callback.  Yes, I can see the race now;
thanks for persisting with the explanation.

Yes, that was one thing I was frustrated with while writing v2 - the
AioContext code simply lacks a notify hook, even though it is
demonstrably useful with GSource.  But plumbing in a notify hook is
more invasive, and puts the series at risk of missing 10.2.  Still,
it's something worth getting right, so I'll try a v3.

Indeed.  And a hard-to-trigger race is, in some regards, worse than a
deadlock because it's harder to reproduce and prove whether it is
fixed.

I'm thinking about whether any of the GSourceCallback solution (using
a reference-counter wrapper around the user's original opaque data to
prove how many in-flight callbacks are still being dispatched) may be
usable with AioContext.
