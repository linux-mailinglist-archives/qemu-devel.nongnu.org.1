Also, we can only know the size of capabilities that are currently
defined, we don't do a great job of keeping up with the latest ECNs.

Unless we have device specific knowledge, the best we can do is hope
that a gap between capabilities is unused.  It might be a helpful
indicator to verify the config space we intend to overlap is zero,
though we can get false positives with such a method if we overlap a
capability that kernel vfio-pci has disconnected from the capability
chain an marked read-only.

Yeah, this is probably one of those cases where we expect we don't have
a foolproof solution and we should allow an override.  I think we're
defining the initial 'auto' algorithm that a -x-vpasid_cap_offset=3D
might use by default.  It should also take a numerical value as an
override though.  We'll need a table so that when we find a device that
requires a different value, that becomes the auto value for that
device.

Also consider how adding subsequent purely virtual capability would
work.  We don't want to have each capability defining a new algorithm
and default offset.  To that extent, we might be better served with a
command line override that specifies available ranges of config space
rather than an offset for a specific vcap.  I think our discussions
related to a kernel interface were headed more in this direction.
Thanks,

Alex
