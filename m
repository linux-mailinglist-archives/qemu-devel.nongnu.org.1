Yeah, this sounds like it is potentially going a step too far in enabling
fully out of tree extension of core QEMU functionality.

If something conceptually is in scope of the core QEMU codebase, then
IMHO, our plugin system should aim to avoid enabling external
implementations as far as is practical.  That was easy when plugins
were limited to observability, but the more we enable in terms of
state modification the wider pandora's box is opened.

Where to draw the line is a hard problem.

Excluding some undesirable features, may well force us to exclude some
potentially desirable plugin use cases at the same time, which may make
it impossible to keep everyone satisfied.

With regards,
Daniel
