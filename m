I think yes, I was waiting, but then switched to other tasks.

Hmm, the only question remains, is what/how to deprecate exactly?

We want to deprecate user's possibility to set intersecting
IDs for exports / devices / block-nodes? I think, we don't
have a QAPI-native way to deprecate such thing..

May be, add new "uuid" parameter, and deprecate its absence (I doubt that we
can do such deprecation too). And deprecate old IDs? But we can't deprecate
QOM path for this..

Hmm, or move to QOM paths for block-nodes and exports? And deprecate export names
and node names?

Or we can just deprecate intersecting IDs in documentation and start to print warning,
when user make intersecting IDs? But nobody reads warnings..

Is there a proper way to deprecate such things?
