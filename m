There are some tests that run differently under '-nbd -qcow2' than
under '-nbd -file'; but you are also correct that any qcow2 test that
relies on image resizing can't work with nbd.

Yeah, that does sound better...

...but I'm not opposed to inertia sticking to a slightly inaccurate
name over the pain of churn just to change the name.  It's not
something that Coccinelle can automate.
