Note that much of the commentary about distros versions has been in
relation to the distro packagers, but that was not my only target
in writing the distro policy. It was equally aimed at contributors
using such distros, as well as 3rd party vendors building solutions
on top of designated distro versions

You can say contributors should just pick newer containers for their
build env, or manually download newer deps, or have QEMU build fancy
scripts to auto-download newer deps. All of those options have a cost
to them, as compared to using what is already present in the distro.

In terms of 3rd party vendors, they can have similar roles to a distro
vendor, but are more likely to package up newer QEMU versions to run
on pre-existing distros.

A further goal of the support policy was to provide a mechanism to
eliminate exactly these kind of mail threads. Before we had the policy,
every single time someone wanted to bump the min version of any dep
we would have debates over whether it was OK or not, there was always
someone who wanted the old version of the distro forever.  Defining
the policy has allowed us to unconditionally bump the min versions of
our times on a usually reasonable timeframe, without needing to engage
in debate. We can just point people to our support policy when they
complained that they really wanted old versions X, Y, & Z.

Every time we make an exception to the policy, we undermine the benefits
we obtain from it, taking us back the old world where our min versions
were an inconsistent & arbitrary set, with little clear understanding
of when we would change, either by maintainers or users.


With regards,
Daniel
