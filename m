Hi Daniel,

Thanks a lot for review and the suggestions.

Why very complicated? It calls a simple runner instead of calling the
test script directly, but it doesn't change the way to re-run a single
test. One just have to pass V=1 to see make's command line  and copy
and paste the full command line to re-run the test. I mentioned
inspecting 'testlog-thorough.txt' just for completeness.


>   * It makes the meson.build rules much more complicated

Do we want to never augment functional tests' meson.build? Nothing
complicated is being added. Basically, just a new variable suffixed with
'_with_runner' which holds a tuple (test, runner) that tell the test
to be executed, following the same logic we already have for all the other
variables that specify the tests per arch/mode/speed.

Another option would be to select a runner based on a suffix in the test
name, for instance, 'reverse_debug_with_runner.py'.

This is because of an unfortunate GDB Python API issue, please see my
reply in your comment on patch 5/5. This can be solved but needs more
investigation on GDB side.

Yes, I do want to directly use the 'gdb' python module directly in the
tests. We shouldn't look at a solution only for reverse_debug.py but also
think of any future tests that will require the GDB Python API, so I don't
want to specialize here and reduce the API to a single method.

For the sake of not adding a few lines into meson.build, we are going
to design a new ad-hoc API for the functional tests on top of the GDB
Python API, which will communicate with the test script via a socket
and will _still require a runner anyway_ (just now hidden under a
module/API)? This is far more complicated than having a simple runner
to call GDB and pass the test script.

In fact, I think that if the test script had any clue in its name,
like the "_with_runner" suffix I mentioned above, maybe Meson's could
take care of calling GDB itself without calling any runner. Would that
address your first comment in the bullets (and maybe the second one too,
but not sure without trying it) and get this series accepted by you,
since the third one, about the exitcode, is related to GDB's odd behavior?


Cheers,
Gustavo
