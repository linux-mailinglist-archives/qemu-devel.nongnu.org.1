I think it looks better (can't tell if it will work so leave review to 
others who know this better). Maybe just a couple of more nits below.

I'm not sure this last paragraph below belongs here or maybe better put it 
somewhere else (but if nobody else objects it can be left here for 
reminder and later clean up). I know I suggested to add a comment to note 
this but this comment is a bit long and with a lot of uncertainity so 
maybe it's enough to put this paragraph in the commit message, but it 
could be it will be burried there and nobody will see it later so a 
comment is more prominent place. I'm OK with it either way.

You could leave the definition without value here (what's now in the 
#else) and then only assign it in the #if so this line would become

-int (*qemu_main)(void) = qemu_default_main;
+int (*qemu_main)(void);

and this would be

qemu_main = os_darwin_cfrunloop_main;

and no need for #else. Also the name of this darwin main is a bit long, 
maybe qemu_darwin_main or qemu_default_main_darwin could be better?

This could be moved within the if (qemu_main) below as it's not needed 
outside.

What locks the bql at this point? I could not find the part in qemu_init 
that makes it necessary to unlock it here. If nothing else is called 
before this, is it needed to take the lock and then unlock it here or can 
it be assumed to be unlocked yet?
