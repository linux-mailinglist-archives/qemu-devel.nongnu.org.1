Philippe already queued this (and another) patch. This fixes AmigaOS on 
sam460ex which became usable with the tlbwe changes in this cycle but it's 
not really usable without a file system driver that this patch fixes. 
Please allow this in 9.0 so users who want to try it don't have to wait a 
few months more. Sorry for sending it this late but it was reported late 
and took time to debug it.
