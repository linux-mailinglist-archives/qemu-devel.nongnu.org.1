I think I tried to do a little bit of that. For example, the split of
configuration from runtime state is done to isolate the interior
mutability, and the automatic generation of instance_init and
instance_finalize relies on Rust traits like Default and Drop; the
realize implementation returns a qemu::Result<()>; and so on.

But there are many steps towards converting the PL011 device to Rust:

- declarative definitions of bitfields and registers (done)
- using RefCell for mutable state
- using wrappers for class and property definition
- defining and using wrappers for Chardev/CharBackend
- defining and using wrappers for MemoryRegion callbacks
- defining and using wrappers for SysBusDevice functionality
- defining and using wrappers for VMState functionality

At each step we need to design "how we want to do that in Rust" and
all the things you mention above. This prototype covers the second and
third steps, and it's already big enough! :)

I expect that code like this one would be merged together with the
corresponding changes to PL011: the glue code is added to the qemu/
crate and used in the hw/core/pl011/ directory. This way, both authors
and reviewers will have a clue of what becomes more readable/idiomatic
in the resulting code.

That's true, especially if we want to add more macro magic on top. We
can decide later where to draw the line between complexity of glue
code and cleanliness of Rust code, and also move the line as we see
fit.

On the other hand, if we believe that _this_ code is already too much,
that's also a data point. Again: I don't think it is, but I want us to
make an informed decision.

Yep, Error is an example of this. It's not the common case, so it's
totally fine to convert to and from C Error* (which also includes
copying the inner error string, from a String to malloc-ed char*) to
keep the APIs nicer.

Not the main reason, but an important factor in judging if we are
*able* to accept usage of a new language. Maybe it's just a formal
step, but it feels safer to have _some_ code to show and to read, even
if it's just a prototype that barely compiles.

That's a possibility, yes. Something like (totally random):

impl CharBackend {
    pub fn start<T: CharBackendCallbacks>(&mut self, obj: &T) {
        qemu_chr_fe_set_handlers(self.0,
                             Some(obj::can_receive),
Some(obj::receive, obj::event),
                             Some(obj::be_change), obj as *const _ as
*const c_void,
                             ptr::null(), true);
    }
    pub fn stop(&mut self) {
        qemu_chr_fe_set_handlers(self.0, None, None,
                             None, ptr::null(), ptr::null(), true);
    }
}

but I left for later because I focused just on the lowest levels code
where you could have "one" design. For example, for memory regions
some devices are going to have more than one, so there could be
reasons to do callbacks in different ways. By the way, all of this
passing of Rust references as opaque pointers needs, at least in
theory, to be annotated for pinning. Do we have to make sure that
pinning is handled correctly, or can we just assume that QOM objects
are pinned? I am not sure I am ready to answer the question...
