Yes, in general there should never be a for "yank", *if* QMEU is implemented
correctly. yank is there in case something unexpected happens.

IOW, even if we think migration is perfect today, yank is still worth
having there as a safety net.

We've not wired up any API for this libvirt. I can be issued via libvirt's
QMP passthrough API if desired though.
