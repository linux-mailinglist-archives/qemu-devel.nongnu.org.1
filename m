This (default) placement and size were the consequence of the default
VCPU phys address width (allowing for a 64GB phys address space) and
that in most cases one wouldn't have large enough guest RAM (or a large
enough guest RAM hotplug range) to disturb this default.

In general, yes, it worked fine, but there were numerous exceptions too
where it didn't work. Especially GPU cards with huge BARs.

The only motivation is user convenience. The explicit (albeit
experimental) fw_cfg works 100% well if we're willing to expose users to
manual tweaking. The alternative is to automate the calculations
*fully*. (It makes no sense, IMO, to unburden users "somewhat", in this
regard.)

In that sense, considering user experience, your patch is actually
great. On the other hand, it's not entirely sound from an engineering
perspective (IMO). I do feel we need a new information channel for this.
