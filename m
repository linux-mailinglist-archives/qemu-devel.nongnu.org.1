We already have a CPU model that works for both KVM and TCG: that
is "max". We're not going to add another one. The difference is
just that we provide different cross-version migration compatibility
support levels for the two cases. (Strictly speaking, I'm not sure we
strongly support migration compat for 'max' on KVM either --
for instance you probably need to be doing a migration on the
same host CPU type and the same host kernel version. It's just
that the definition of "max" on KVM is less QEMU-dependent and
more host-kernel-dependent, so in your particular situation running
the test cases you're less likely to see any possible breakage.)
