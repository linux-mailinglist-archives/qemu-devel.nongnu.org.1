I don't think that is a particularly helpful comment for someone who is
taking the time to review your patches. Reading through the thread I
didn't see anything that said this is how real HW behaves but I may well
have missed it. However you have a number of review comments to address
so I suggest you spin a v2 of the series to address them and outline the
reason to accept an out of spec transaction.
