That's true, ideally we want to match what people are already doing.

It was originally added to support Oreboot (the Rust version of
Coreboot). The idea was that Oreboot (ROM) would be in flash and then
go from there.

It also applies to other ROM code that a user might want to test that
runs before OpenSBI.

Overall for this patch I don't feel strongly about following what ARM
does or continuing with what we already have. I would prefer to match
other archs if we can though.

Also, either way we should update the documentation in
docs/system/riscv/virt.rst to describe what happens.
