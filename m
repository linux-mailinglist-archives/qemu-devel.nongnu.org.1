I agree. If for a specific event it's impossible to provide a value 
(i.e. the value has no meaning for a real cpu), it will just point that 
we need several types of data per event, and the compromise of having a 
single callback won't be possible.

We should differentiate "it's hard to find this value in QEMU" vs "this 
value does not exist in real life". The first can be solved if we put 
effort into it. And every time a cpu changes it's flow of execution, it 
makes sense to find where it was just before.

One of the end goals is to be able to build a full control flow graph, 
with edges labeled on transition type (exceptions, traps, interrupts, 
jump, fallback), which we can do with the triple {event,from,to}.

It's an interesting conversation. For the scope of this series, I agree 
you should use the jump target, which triggered the trap.

In fine, transitions should simply follow what the cpu does.

- orig_insn: jump to A
- jump_target: execute A traps
- page_fault: load page
- jump_target: come back to A

event(JUMP, orig_insn, jump_target) // not covered by this series
event(EXCEPTION, jump_target, page_fault)
... execute page_fault (with potential other transitions)
event(JUMP, end_page_fault, jump_target)

In the case of a double trap, we could follow the same logic, and 
represent the original transition that lead to the trap, and the two 
consecutive traps.

Does it make sense?

However, I rarely see this term used in the literature for computer science, and people use "exceptional control flow" to qualify interrupts and traps. In more, when we'll integrate classic control flow (including fallback between tb), the term discontinuity will lose its meaning. For this reason, I think that {cflow,CFLOW} makes more sense.

I'm happy to read this spec reinvents a term clearly defined elsewhere 
(sigh...). Beyond the intellectual vocabulary creation pleasure, it's 
good to use term people can find on Google.

We can use this term though, PC discontinuity makes sense, and a 
fallback is a special case of discontinuity if we adopt this 
perspective. Thanks for explaining!
