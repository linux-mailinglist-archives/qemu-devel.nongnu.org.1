Sure:

(iothread and fixed-iothread)

If you set the @iothread option on both the (guest) device and the 
export (and also @fixed-iothread on the export), then you’ll get an 
error.  Nothing to do with this new @iothreads option here.

It shouldn’t affect the failure.  Setting @iothread on both device and 
export (with @fixed-iothread) will always cause an error, and should.  
Setting this option is not supposed to “fix” that configuration error.

Theoretically, setting @iothreads here could make it so that 
BlockExportOptions.iothread (and/or fixed-iothread) is ignored, because 
that thread will no longer be used for export-issued I/O; but in 
practice, setting that option (BlockExportOptions.iothread) moves that 
export and the whole BDS tree behind it to that I/O thread, so if you 
haven’t specified an I/O thread on the guest device, the guest device 
will then use that thread.  So making @iothreads silently completely 
ignore BlockExportOptions.iothread may cause surprising behavior.

Maybe we could make setting @iothreads here and the generic 
BlockExportOptions.iothread at the same time an error.  That would save 
us the explanation here.

This part of the documentation would concern itself less with “how to 
use it”, and more “when to use it”: This round-robin distribution of 
requests across FDs means that even if I/O is run in a single thread, 
using multiple threads for the export may improve performance (as shown 
in the commit message) – in contrast to virtqueue-based systems.  So I 
think that’s important information to users.
