We already log every single QMP command & response and event we deal
with, at INFO level, but by default our log files are only set to
capture WARN level, so this isn't visible without extra config steps
by the ademin

Possibly we could think about dumping all migration stats to
/var/log/libvirt/qemu/$GUEST.log at migration completion
