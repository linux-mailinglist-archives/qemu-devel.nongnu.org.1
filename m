I’m sorry, but currently Zhaoxin has not released any specs or 
datasheets related
to the current patch. Zhaoxin CPUs are compatible with the x86 architecture,
particularly with Intel. For example, you can refer to the Intel SDM 
(Software
Developer’s Manual). Regarding the current patch, except for the 
features in the
EDX of CPUID leaf 0xC000_0001, all other features can be found in the 
general Intel
specs and are already well known. The Zhaoxin-specific features in CPUID 
leaf
0xC000_0001 were introduced to the Linux Kernel a long time ago. For 
example, the
FEAT_C000_0001_EDX feature word defined in QEMU comes from the Linux 
kernel’s
arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h. The CPU model is just a feature 
enumeration
function, which I believe does not require as deep an understanding of 
the features
as driver code does. These changes will only affect users attempting to 
emulate
Zhaoxin CPUs and will not impact other Vendor/Micro-Arch CPUs.
