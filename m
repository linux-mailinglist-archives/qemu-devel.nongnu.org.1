The name is ugly.  Naming is hard.  No need to worry about it right now.

Semantics of having both 'if' and 'available_if'?  To work out an
answer, let's consider how to convert conditionals:

* 'if': STRING

  If STRING is a target-specific macro, replace by 'available_if': PRED,
  where PRED is the equivalent run-time predicate.

  Else, no change.

* 'if': { 'all': [COND, ...] }

  If COND contains only target-specific macros, replace by
  'available_if': { 'all': [PRED, ...] }, where the PRED are the
  equivalent run-time predicates.

  If COND contains no target-specific macros, no change.

  What if it contains both?

  - If each COND contains either only target-specific macros, or no
    target-specific macros, we could split the target-specific ones off
    into an additional 'available_if'.  This requires defining the
    semantics of having both 'if' and 'available_if' as "both conditions
    must be satisfied".

  - What if this isn't the case?

* 'if' { 'any': [COND, ...] }

  Similar, but to be able to split the COND we need "either condition
  must be satisfied".

Even if we can make this work somehow, it would likely be a royal mess
to explain in qapi-code-gen.rst.

We currently don't have "mixed" conditionals.  So we could sidestep the
problem: you can have either 'if' or 'available_if', but not both.
Feels like a cop out to me.

What if we move the "is dynamic" bit from the root of the conditional to
its leaves?  So far, the leaves are macro names.  What if we
additionally permit a function name?

Function name, not C expression, to not complicate generating code in
languages other than C too much.

Ignore the question of syntax for now, i.e. how to decide whether a leaf
is a macro or a function name.

I can't see concrete blockers at this time.  I just wanted to make you
aware of the emerging need to support other languages.

I'm mildly unhappy about the bloat, but not enough to fix it.

I reiterate my dislike for having behavior depend on argv[0].  We'll
figure out something.
