In relation to [1] you seem to be also interested in the migration
between heterogeneous systems with qemu.

Do you think targeting migration within a cpu family is enough for your
use cases. How different are the source and destination host on your
cases. Do you thing feat props are relevant in your case or would you
need lower granularity at idreg field levelto pass the migration?
