For an assigned device, the device MMIO space will be directly mapped
into the VM address space (assuming the PCI BAR is at least PAGE_SIZE),
so there's no emulation of the access.  You can disable this with the
x-no-mmap=3Don option for the vfio-pci device, where then I'd guess this
behaves the same as your emulated device (assuming we really don't
reach QEMU for the access).

Since you're not seeing a KVM_EXIT_MMIO I'd guess this is more of a KVM
issue than QEMU (Cc kvm list).  Possibly KVM doesn't emulate vmovdqu
relative to an MMIO access, but honestly I'm not positive that AVX
instructions are meant to work on MMIO space.  I'll let x86 KVM experts
more familiar with specific opcode semantics weigh in on that.

Is your "program" just doing a memcpy() with an mmap() of the PCI BAR
acquired through pci-sysfs or a userspace vfio-pci driver within the
guest?

In QEMU 4a2e242bbb30 ("memory: Don't use memcpy for ram_device
regions") we resolved an issue[1] where QEMU itself was doing a memcpy()
to assigned device MMIO space resulting in breaking functionality of
the device.  IIRC memcpy() was using an SSE instruction that didn't
fault, but didn't work correctly relative to MMIO space either.

So I also wouldn't rule out that the program isn't inherently
misbehaving by using memcpy() and thereby ignoring the nature of the
device MMIO access semantics.  Thanks,

Alex
