A zoned device will always handle writes in the order they were submitted (per
zone) and that is true for emulated devices as well as real ones. The
completions may not be seen in order though, but that is fine.
So what you are saying above is not a problem. The resubmitted failed write will
go after the ones already submitted (and about to be failed) and may succeed if
it is aligned to the wp, or fail. Whichever will happen only after all the
already submitted writes have failed.
