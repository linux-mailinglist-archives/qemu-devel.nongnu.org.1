Does it? The documentation states:

  guint len;

  the number of elements in the GArray not including the possible terminati=
ng zero element.

I think the actual allocated size is hidden from you by glib as an
implementation detail.

We are nothing if not inconsistent in the code base ;-) There are a
number of _t types that in retrospect shouldn't have been.

If we just return values rather than pointers we can stick with simpler
types.

I would have to see an example of why giving this indirection to the
plugin makes things easier.

Agreed.

I think that works, do we know it even if we haven't allocated any
scoreboards?
