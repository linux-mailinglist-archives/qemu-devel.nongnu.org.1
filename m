Hmm interesting.  There also looks like a thread doing rpoll().

Btw, not sure whether you noticed, but there's the series posted for the
latest rsocket conversion here:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/1717503252-51884-1-git-send-email-arei.gonglei@huawei.com

I hope Lei and his team has tested >4G mem, otherwise definitely worth
checking.  Lei also mentioned there're rsocket bugs they found in the cover
letter, but not sure what's that about.

I think my first impression on this matter came from you on this one. :)

Yes, and zero-copy requires multifd for now. I think it's because we didn't
want to complicate the header processings in the migration stream where it
may not be page aligned.

I'm not sure whether it'll still be a problem if rdma recv side is based on
zero-copy.  It would be a matter of whether atomicity can be guaranteed so
that we don't want the guest vcpus to see a partially copied page during
on-flight DMAs.  UFFDIO_COPY (or friend) is currently the only solution for
that.
