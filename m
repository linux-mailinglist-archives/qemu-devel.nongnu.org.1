One peculiarity about virtio-scsi, as far as I understand, is that its 
context is not necessarily the BB’s context, because one virtio-scsi 
device may have many BBs.  While the BBs are being hot-plugged or 
un-plugged, their context may change (as is happening here), but that 
doesn’t stop SCSI request processing, because SCSI requests happen 
independently of whether there are devices on the SCSI bus.

If SCSI request processing is not thread-safe, doesn’t that mean it 
always must be done in the very same context, i.e. the context the 
virtio-scsi device was configured to use?  Just because a new scsi-hd BB 
is added or removed, and so we temporarily have a main context BB 
associated with the virtio-scsi device, I don’t think we should switch 
to processing requests in the main context.
