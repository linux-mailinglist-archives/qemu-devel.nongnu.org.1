exec can support bi-directional migration - we have both stdin + stdout
for the command. For exec it is mostly a documentation problem - you
can't merely use 'cat' for example, but if you used 'socat' that could
be made to work bi-directionally.

In Het's series the 'migrate_incoming' command similarly has a chaneltype
parameter.
