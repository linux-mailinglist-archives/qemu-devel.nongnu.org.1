Thanks for the explanation. Yes, the cycle buffer isn't helpful.

I think it is possible to remove the cycle buffer. Then, in
mux_chr_read, to remove the escape characters from the input string, we
can either mutate the input string in place (can we?) or allocate a new
buffer to store the escaped string. Then call be->chr_read *once* and
pass it the escaped string.

This should be fine as long as the escaped string cannot be longer than
the original string.

(This cannot handle another corner case where the input string contains
escaped sequences that switch the focus in the middle. But neither does
the current implementation).
