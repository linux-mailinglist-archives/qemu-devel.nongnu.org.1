When I read refactoring, I consider

  * No functional change
  * The change is a logical transformation of text

The creative act is defining the rule for what the transformation will
do. The resulting patch is a derivative work of the existing code,
along with the rules for the transformation.

In traditional cases, the rules are an awk prompt, or a semantic
patch (coccinelle), but in this case, the rules are the AI agent
prompt

The AI training material will guide the tool on how to interpret
your natural language rules, but overall it looks implausible to
claim the resulting patch would be a derivative work of any
training material.

The only exception seems to be if some QEMU fork had made exactly
the same refactoring already, which seems unlikely in general,
when we disregard malicious contributors.


Type annotations gets more complex to rationalize, because that is
about writing net new functional code. As an analogy though, if
there was a clean room dev team, whom were fed the commit message,
their output would likely be identical. The defining characteristic
is the lack of plausible (&correct) alternative approaches. All
tools, whether AI or not, should converge on the same result.

It again looks implausible to suggest the resulting patch could
be a derivative work of any particular agent training material,
unless some QEMU fork had made exactly the same functional change
already. This feels unlikely.

TL:DR: even in today's world where the laundering of training
material licenses, vs AI output licenses is murky, there is
likely sufficient confidence in these particular scenarios to
claim the training material imposes negligible risk to QEMU.

I can rationalize in my mind what I would be willing to accept under
this description, but at the same time this is (intentionally) fairly
fuzzy and open to interpretation.

It would be nice to require full separation, but if an AI gets you
95% of the way there, and the remaining 5% is just stupid typos/
mistakes, it is better for a human to just fix it immediately, than
to continue re-prompting the agent to try again and hoping you win.

Could it be simpler as:

 Sign off is mandatory from a maintainer whom is not the author.

Or where you implying that we need SoB from two maintainers ?

In theory non-author S-o-B is best practice already, but analyzing
git shows we have about 10% of our commits with no independent
S-o-B at all. Often such commits are precisely the NFC refactorings,
or the simple mechanical additions.

So perhaps going from zero-or-one independent SoBs, to at least
one SoB is sufficiently strong ?

Daniel
