Thank you for explanation. It makes a lot of sense.

Yes, I feel that this approach more clearly explains the purpose of QOM
init.

And since we are talking about the safety of INSTANCE_INIT, I think we
should add some safety guidelines here, like:
 * Proper Initialization of pointers and references
 * Explicit initialization of Non-Zero Fields
 * In placed memory region is correctly initialized.

(Or do you have any additional or clearer guidelines?)

This could be the reference when adding SAFETY comment for the device's
own `unsafe` init(). :-)

And this is also a good explanation to distinguish between initialization
in init() and realize(). For example, HPET attempts to initialize the
timer array in realize().

Then do we need to place OBJECT in some suitable memory location (Box or
something) for Rust implementation?

Thanks for sharing! It's a very reasonable direction.
