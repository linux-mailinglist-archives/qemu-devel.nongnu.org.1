Regardless, we shouldn't rely on the BQL for this. The BQL should be
left as last resort for things that interact across subsystems. If
someone is issuing a migration command during a migration, the migration
code is exquisitely positioned to handle that itself.

Parameters are never forbidden, right? And we cannot forbid them with
is_running because some parameters are allowed to be changed while
running.

I feel we should have a more fine grained way of saying "this option
cannot be set at this moment", instead of just using the state as a
proxy. States can change, while the fact that from a certain point on,
certain options should not be touched anymore doesn't change.

Maybe a little infra like bdrv_op_is_blocked, i.e, a list of blocked
operations. It could be set in qmp_migrate and checked in
qmp_set_parameters/caps.

For incoming, yes. And this is maybe a point in favor of adding the
'config'.

For outgoing, there's still the point I mentioned above about how to
restrict _some_ options to be allowed at runtime and others not.

We should fix the bug, I think your patch is good for that.

Although this kind of overlaps with some things we've been discussing
with Prasad. I'd be super happy if the code magically stopped using
QAPI's MigrationStatus for internal tracking of migration state and
blocking of commands and so on.

Whatever comes first =)

---
Side note, did we ever discuss something like this?

struct MigrationState {
   <state>
   union {
     <outgoing>
     <incoming>
   }
}

there's so much stuff in these structs...
