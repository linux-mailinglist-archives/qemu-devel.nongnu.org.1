This is not incompatible - it is fully backcompatible with existing
usage initially, which should make it pretty trivial to introduce
to the code. Mgmt apps can carry on using migrate-set-capabilities
and migrate-set-parameters, and ignore these new 'capabilities'
and 'parameters' fields if desired.

Only once we decide to deprecate migrate-set-capabilities, would
it become incompatible.

Potentially yes, but 'resume' is conceptually different to all
the other capabilities and parameters, so I could see it remaining
as a distinct field as it is now

We could deprecate that today then.

As a mgmt app dev I don't want there to be an arbitrary distinction
between what I can pass with 'migrate' and what I have to use a
separate command for. If I'm starting a migration, I just want to
pass all the settings with the 'migrate' command. I should not have
to care about separate 'migrate-set-parameters' command at all, unless
I actually need to change something on the fly (many migrates will
never need this).

With regards,
Daniel
