Hi, Pierrick,

resent as I was too stupid to hit reply instead of reply-all.

>=20I tend to disagree on that. IMHO, it's better to reduce number of API=
 entries instead of callback types.

>=20For the syscall cbs, we already have a specific callback. So why not =
here?

>=20It's ok for the user. But I think it's more complicated to extend, wh=
en we'll want to introduce control flow API in the future. Do we want 5 o=
r 6 different callbacks when people want to track fully control flow from=
 a plugin?

Ok, I'll introduce an enum and combine the three callbacks in the next
iteration then.

cific cases.

But how would such an interface look? The last PC aside, what would you
include, and how? A GArray with named items that are itself just opaque
blobs?

And what would be the benefit compared to just querying the respective
target specific registers through qemu_plugin_read_register? Which btw.
is what we were going to do for our use-case. Even the example you
brought up (howvec) uses querying functions and doesn't expect to get
all the info via parameters.

f we don't provide it for all events yet, it's ok.

Yes, I certainly see the advantages of having either the last PC or the
would-be-next PC as they are sufficiently universal. You can usually
retrieve them from target-specific registers, but that may be more
complicated in practice. In the case of RISC-V for example, the value
of the EPC differs between interrupts and exceptions.

That PC value should also be easy enough to obtain at the hook call
sites. We only need to store the (old) PC before doing the setup. The
"to-address" is the current PC at the time the callback is invoked.
Anything else would be a bug. I was going to write that you can
already query that in a plugin through a dedicated helper function
but apparently I misremembered.

I'll include this in the next iteration.

>=20We can have one "builder" function per data type, with fixed paramete=
rs (no varargs), it's reasonable and would scale well with new entries/da=
ta information.

I'm still not on board on preparing a more complex data type. For the
next iteration I'd rather stick to a simple function receiving the
"type" of event and the PCs. That may not be extensible, but I don't see
any benefit in shoehorning inheritelntly target-specifc information into
a complex struct.

If this is a hard requirement, I'll of course still do so.

Regards,
Julian
