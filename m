And also sireg for the imsic range.

Yes, these are the three cases I was expecting, where there's also a 1.5
which is "host supports AIA extension but KVM doesn't support
usermode-imsic". Case 1.5 should also result in reporting an error. I'm
not sure we have 1.5, though, since it looks like the KVM AIA support
already attempts to fallback to a potential usermode-imsic. So maybe
it'll work without any KVM changes.

We could also take this fix now and then do the usermode-imsic on top
later.

Thanks,
