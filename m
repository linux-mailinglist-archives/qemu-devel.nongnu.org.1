Yes, yes, yes, yes & more yes :-)

I cry every time I have to read the qemu-img --help output,
and I'm not much of a fan of the man page either to be fair,
as I don't like the global list of options at the top which
is divorced from which commands actually use them.

These days I see many programs with subcommands switching to
a separate man page per sub-command. Still, I'm not asking
you todo that too, its just an idea for the gallery.

This is basically a crutch for incomplete conversion of the block
layer APIs, which meant we had a situation where we wanted to use
image opts syntax for the source, but were unable todo so for
the target:

  commit 305b4c60f200ee8e6267ac75f3f5b5d09fda1079
  Author: Daniel P. Berrangé <berrange@redhat.com>
  Date:   Mon May 15 17:47:11 2017 +0100

    qemu-img: introduce --target-image-opts for 'convert' command
    
    The '--image-opts' flag indicates whether the source filename
    includes options. The target filename has to remain in the
    plain filename format though, since it needs to be passed to
    bdrv_create().  When using --skip-create though, it would be
    possible to use image-opts syntax. This adds --target-image-opts
    to indicate that the target filename includes options. Currently
    this mandates use of the --skip-create flag too.

we do have internal support for creating block devices using
the full QAPI schema, via BlockdevCreateOptions.

I'm not sure if bdrv_create can be made to create using the
image-opts syntax. If it can, there is still the additional
problem that after creation it then needs to re-open the
file, and the image-opts for open is defined by BlockdevOptions
not BlockdevCreateOptions. So we would need a way to convert
from the latter to the former.



With regards,
Daniel
