Just to make sure we're on the same page - this series didn't introduce any
new concept.  Patch 1-6 can be seen as a "cleanup" because we already use
object compat properties before.

It was explicitly coded though to invoke object_apply_compat_props() in
whatever objects that care about it.  This "cleanup" introduced another
class so that explicit call (in most cases, post_init hook) can be avoided.

Side benefit is, anything else can start to inherit from OBJECT_COMPAT now
even if not a qdev, with no further open-coded invocations.

I need to confess I don't fully get how this can be defined in QAPI,
however no matter how it can be defined, we already have the QOBJECT
solution..  Some elaboration on that part would be helpful.

This part of discussion seems to have some block layer internals involved
that I'm not familiar with.  I'm not sure I get it, but I'll leave others
to chime in..

Yes, it's not only about machine types.  Per discussed above [1], literally
it was called object_compat_props[].

An object applies it with object_apply_compat_props().  Machine type is
only using index 1, and it's only one user of compat properties, only that
it's the major user.
