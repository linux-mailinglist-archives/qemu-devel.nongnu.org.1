looking at the code some more, it looks like 2 parties are at fault
 1. linux kernel clearing GPE status bits on boot without processing events,
    (if it had processed pending CPU hotplug event, that would have cleared all
     insert flags which are NOPs at this point)
 2. a bug in CPU_SCAN_METHOD AML code, which doesn't take remove event branch
    if there is insert event on the same CPU. So #1 effectively hides unplug
    until user triggers the next (un)plug event.
    Unplug request is just a request and if it didn't happen for some reason
    the user shall repeat it.
    However it doesn't excuse QEMU behavior which effectively doesn't process
    pending remove event in the same scan loop.

one way to reproduce it would be use qmeu with uefi,
boot till grub prompt and then do device_del and let guest to finish boot.
The 2nd device_del works as workaround.
