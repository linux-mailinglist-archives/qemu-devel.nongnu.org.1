This sounds like a performance concern, and I wonder how much this impacts
the real workload (that you run a test and measure, with/without such
concurrency) when we can save two devices in parallel anyway; I would
expect the real diff is small due to the fact I mentioned that we save >1
VFIO devices concurrently via multifd.

Do you think we can start with a simpler approach?

So what I'm thinking could be very clean is, we just discussed about
MIG_CMD_SWITCHOVER and looks like you also think it's an OK approach.  I
wonder when with it why not we move one step further to have
MIG_CMD_SEND_NON_ITERABE just to mark that "iterable devices all done,
ready to send non-iterable".  It can be controlled by the same migration
property so we only send these two flags in 9.2+ machine types.

Then IIUC VFIO can send config data through main wire (just like most of
other pci devices! which is IMHO a good fit..) and on destination VFIO
holds off loading them until passing the MIG_CMD_SEND_NON_ITERABE phase.

Side note: when looking again, I really think we should cleanup some
migration switchover phase functions, e.g. I think
qemu_savevm_state_complete_precopy() parameters are pretty confusing,
especially iterable_only, even if inside it it also have some postcopy
implicit checks, urgh.. but this is not relevant to our discussion, and I
won't draft that before your series land; that can complicate stuff.

Right, let's see how you think about above.
