Thanks a lot for you respond me soon!
The exact instruction is mrc, and the exception happended in early boot
process. I have no idea to how to debug this error because it happended in
code_gen_prologue.
I need to comform that whether QEMU A55 fully supports aarch32 mode. If it
need me to add addition instructions to support this function, I will
suspend this task for now.
I hope to get your respond as soon as possible.
Best regards!

&gt; Dear QEMU developers<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I hope this email finds you well. We are currently facing an issue rel=
ated to QEMU and the Cortex-A55 architecture. Specifically, we have compile=
d a firmware for Cortex-A55 and would like it to run smoothly on QEMU A55 i=
n AArch32 mode.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Despite our numerous attempts, we continue to encounter an &quot;undef=
ined instruction&quot; error when running the firmware in QEMU. Our questio=
n is whether QEMU supports this particular use case=E2=80=94specifically, w=
hether it can handle A55 running AArch32 firmware.<br>
<br>
We have Cortex-A55 emulation, but you may be running into one<br>
of a few problems:<br>

<br>
The thing you&#39;d need to do is look at exactly what the UNDEF<br>
instruction is (and what the guest code that causes it is<br>
trying to do) to figure out which of these is the problem.<br>
Some of these might be easy to fix; some would be harder.<br>
If you&#39;re in a position to be able to modify the firmware<br>
image then that would also allow you to work around missing<br>
QEMU functionality if necessary.<br>
<br>
The more usual reason guest firmware not working in QEMU is<br>
not the CPU emulation itself but lack of a model of the<br>
device/SoC/etc hardware that the firmware assumes it&#39;s<br>
running on.<br>
