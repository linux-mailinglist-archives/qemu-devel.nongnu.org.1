The work clearly needs to be done.  Whether it needs to be blocking
other things is less clear.

Even if it doesn't need to be blocking, we may choose not to avoid
blocking for now.  That should be an informed decision, though.

All I'm trying to do here is understand the tradeoffs, so I can give
useful advice.

When exactly does this pinning happen before the patch?  In which
function?

I understand that hiding the delay from the guest could be useful.

Alright, what are the delays you observe with and without these patches
for three test cases that pin 50 / 100 / 200 GiB of THP memory
respectively?
