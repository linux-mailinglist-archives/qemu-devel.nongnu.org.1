Currently QEMU has to know some details about the VirtIO device
supported by a vhost-user daemon to be able to setup the guest. This
makes it hard for QEMU to add support for additional vhost-user
daemons without adding specific stubs for each additional VirtIO
device.

This patch suggests a new feature flag (VHOST_USER_PROTOCOL_F_PROBE)
which the back-end can advertise which allows a probe message to be
sent to get all the details QEMU needs to know in one message.

Together with the existing features VHOST_USER_PROTOCOL_F_STATUS and
VHOST_USER_PROTOCOL_F_CONFIG we can create "standalone" vhost-user
daemons which are capable of handling all aspects of the VirtIO
transactions with only a generic stub on the QEMU side. These daemons
can also be used without QEMU in situations where there isn't a full
VMM managing their setup.

v2
  - dropped F_STANDALONE in favour of F_PROBE
  - split probe details across several messages
  - probe messages don't automatically imply a standalone daemon
  - add wording where probe details interact (F_MQ/F_CONFIG)
  - define VMM and make clear QEMU is only one of many potential VMMs
  - reword commit message
