Agreed.

Surely it does:

        memory_region_set_enabled(mr, false);
        memory_region_del_subregion(&b->hostmem, mr);

will trigger a rebuilding of the flatview - so after the memory region
is deleted any guest access should trigger a fault to the guest. Only
then do we unparent the memory region and finish the clean-up.

I don't think we want to have different paths for KVM and TCG here as it
will further complicate already complicated code.=20

Its mutually incompatible with virglrenderer - we have to block all
commands until the virgl resource is freed and we can't do that until
the memory region is unplugged.

So yes we do bypass RCU for this but by explicitly un-parenting the
resource once the mapping has been removed.

I'm still not seeing how this happens and without a test case to
demonstrate it happening I can't hold this patch in limbo forever.

Not freeing memory regions would lead to a DoS attack instead. I don't
think we can just accumulate region like that.
