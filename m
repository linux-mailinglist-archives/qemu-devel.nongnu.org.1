IIRC that's on rhel QEMU which ports the TDX code before it's merged 
upstream. Now TDX is upstreamed, it works with upstream compat property 
and I think future new compat property won't affect TDX or anything, 
since it's compat property and it's to guarantee the existing behavior 
when introducing new behavior?

I agree in general the parent to child order makes more sense, 
especially when we treat .instance_init() as the phase 1 init and 
.post_instance_init() as the phase 2 init.

But the original purpose of introducing .post_instance_init() was to 
ensure qdev_prop_set_globals() is called at last for Device. Reverse the 
order breaks this purpose.

It seems not good option like the reversed order from child to parent 
that can achieve it by just putting the last step in top parent's.

I'm looking forward to seeing a better solution.
