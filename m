Hi; sorry it's taken me so long to get back to this patch,
but I've now re-read some of the discussion in the other threads.
I generally agree with your reasoning and think we do need
to update the docs here.

I think we could be more specific in this commit message; I've
suggested some expansions of it below. (Partly this is for
my own benefit working through what's going on.)

"because child objects are properties of their owner object, and
(since commit 76a6e1cc7cc3a) we delete an object's properties before
calling the object's instance_finalize method. Deleting the
child property will unparent the child; the later calls to
object_unparent() in its owner's instance_finalize will do nothing.".

"before instance_finalize(), because the only reference to the
MemoryRegion is the one we hold because it is a child property
of its owner, and so when object_finalize_child_property()
calls object_unref(child) the refcount drops to zero and
we finalize the MR."

"This doesn't cause any bad effects in the common case where we
know that the memory allocated for the MemoryRegion itself
is still valid, such as in the common case where the MR
struct is directly embedded in its owner's device state struct.
But it could potentially cause a crash if the MemoryRegion
struct was somewhere else and was freed.

Update the documentation to explicitly prohibit calling
object_unparent() in instance_finalize."

Don't we need also to change the paragraph before this, which
reads:

?

Otherwise we have a paragraph that says "you should call
object_unparent()" followed by one that says "do not call
object_unparent()".

(Also that paragraph's reference to VFIOMSIXInfo is now
out of date -- in 2017 we removed the embedded MemoryRegion
from that struct.)

I think some of these lines are a touch over-length, and should
be wrapped a bit earlier.

Also, this now says "don't unparent in finalize", but
vfio_bars_finalize() has code which follows the old documentation:

    if (vdev->vga) {
        vfio_vga_quirk_finalize(vdev);
        for (i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE(vdev->vga->region); i++) {
            object_unparent(OBJECT(&vdev->vga->region[i].mem));
        }
        g_free(vdev->vga);
    }

Is this wrong and needs changing?
