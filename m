yeah, the code would co-exist in near feature or maybe longer, but mediated
vPMU and the legacy vPMU won't work concurrently, once mediated vPMU is
enabled, it would preempt the legacy vPMU.

I don't prefer to add such property in Qemu. Whether KVM selects to enable
mediated vPMU or the legacy perf-based vPMU, it should be transparent for
Qemu. Qemu is unnecessary to know it.

Currently Qemu already has too much PMU related options, such as pmu,
lbr/arch_lbr. It's too complicated, it introduces too much dependency on
the code and user needs to take time to learn how to configure these
options correctly as well. 

We don't need more options, on the contrary we need to simplify the PMU
options in Qemu. The ideal situation is to keep only one "pmu" option which
is used to manage all these PMU features, like basic perfmon, LBR and PEBS
etc,. But it may cause back-compatible issues if remove these additional
options...
