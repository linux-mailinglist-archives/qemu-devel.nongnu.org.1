You should check what mechanism you're trying to use to "turn off the cores=
";
there are several possibilities, some of which are "this ought to
work, so if it isn't doing the right thing that's a bug to investigate",
and some of which are "this is a feature that's not implemented at
all right now":

In the "should work" category:
 * if the CPU executes a WFI instruction we will stop executing code
   (until the next interrupt)
 * If you are using QEMU's PSCI implementation and you power the CPU
   down with e.g. PSCI CPU_OFF we should also stop executing code.
   (NB this is different from if you're running real guest firmware and
   the firmware is handling PSCI calls)

In the "not implemented" category:
 * If you are trying to stop the CPU with a WFE instruction, we do not
   stop executing code (we emulate it as a NOP, which is architecturally
   permitted).
 * If you are trying to stop the CPU with some raspi-SoC-specific power
   controller, we don't currently have a model of that, I think

If you need a working raspi SoC power controller device, the answer
is that that power controller needs to be modelled so that when the
guest uses it to turn off a CPU it makes the appropriate calls to
arm_set_cpu_off() etc.  This should be straightforward assuming that
you have the appropriate datasheets/specs/etc describing the hardware
behaviour.

If you need WFE to work, that's certainly feasible and something it would
be nice to see, but potentially quite a bit of work in the guts of QEMU's
arm emulation. (Basically going to sleep on WFE is easy but then making
sure that all the events  and situations that need to wake up a WFE is
tedious. We implement sleep-on-WFI but not sleep-on-WFI because the set
of WFI-wakeup events is rather smaller than the WFE-wakeup events.) It's
been in the "we really should implement this but since the only downside
is the host CPUs spinning, we've never got round to it" bucket for years.

(In the cases where we do stop executing code that means that that
vCPU thread should no longer be doing a lot of work; obviously
if your system has more vCPUs than host CPUs then the host CPUs
will still all be busy.)

Your other option here is "stop trying to use the raspberry pi
machine types". The "virt" board, because it doesn't need to try
to implement the same behaviour as an exact machine type, has a
much easier job, and it already supports "you can have just one
CPU with -smp 1" and "you can have an SMP system where you power
off some of the CPUs while running". Basically "virt" is actively
maintained, whereas the raspi machines are in the "Odd Fixes" state,
which means we'll try to review patches but nobody is actively
working on trying to make them better.
