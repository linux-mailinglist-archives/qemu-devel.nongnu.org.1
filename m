Short answer is that post run analysis isn't of much use for developing the=
 OS
software story. It works to some degree if you are designing the tracking
hardware or algorithms to use that hardware capture a snapshot of hotness -
dealing with lack of counters, that sort of thing.=20

The main intent of this support is to drive live usage of the data in the O=
S.
So it gets this hotness information and migrates more frequently accessed m=
emory
to a 'nearer'/lower latency memory node.

=46rom an OS point of view there will be two ways it uses it:
1) Offline application optimization  - that aligns with your suggestion of =
offline
   analysis but would typically still need to be live because we have to do
   the reverse maps and work out what was allocated in particular locations.
   Not impossible to dump that information from QEMU + the guest OS but the=
 usage
   flow would then look quite different from what makes sense on real hardw=
are
   where all the data is available to the host OS directly.
2) Migration of memory.  This will dynamically change the PA backing a VA w=
hilst
   applications are running. The aim being to develop how that happens, we =
need
   the dynamic state.
