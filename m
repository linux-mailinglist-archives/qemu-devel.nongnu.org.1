talking to daemon in terms of power per pkg, e.t.c., we won't care
which MRSs go over wire between daemon and QEMU. Then QEMU can map
that to relevant MSRs (based on cpumodel) internally.

yep, it's bad config, but typical for overcommit scenario.
if we can't get correct measurement in this case,
then at least printing a warning once could be nice.

(it would be better to refuse starting without vCPU pinning,
but given pinning isn't done by QEMU, I don't see a way to do that.)
