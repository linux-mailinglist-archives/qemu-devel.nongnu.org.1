We came across this while chasing another bug, which turned out to be in 
other unrelated code. I also don't know if fixing this first of several 
issues improves the situation for people running an affected 
configuration. We only use qemu configurations where the broken code path 
is not hit. So, I am not sure this can be called renewed interest in 
fixing the issue. But if this is committed, I think there should be at 
least a comment pointing to the other issues.

Cheers,
Stefan
