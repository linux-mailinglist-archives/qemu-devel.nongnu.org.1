I can't send pull requests, don't have a signing key and never did that. 
So far it worked by submitting patches and the ppc maintainer merging them 
so I'd stay with that work flow. I'm listed as maintainer so if there's 
some problem with these machines I'll look to fix them and I try to 
make sure these work so you'd only need to do usual integration testing 
before pull and don't have to take responsibility for these machines 
otherwise.

Currently Mark wanted an alternative approach instead of patch 1 which was 
tested so just waiting for him to finalise that then remaining patch 2-4 
from latest version of this series (v5) should apply but I can resubmit 
that as v6 with a Based-on: tag if that helps.

I don't know who will metge Mark's series, Philippe seems to have some IDE 
patches queued so maybe he can take that too then might as well take this 
series if you give an Acked-by for it.

BALATON Zoltan
