I guess it was inevitable (and perhaps you had this thought).  QEMU ordering
of BDF has the bytes swapped wrt to the ACPI ordering.  With them split the
test was failing.  I'll also tweak the test to ensure we have a non 0 bus
number (by inserting a root port rather than having the generic initiator
on the root bridge bus 0).

Ankit.  Can you confirm if you were seeing these reversed?

https://elixir.bootlin.com/qemu/v9.0.1/source/hw/acpi/acpi_generic_initiator.c#L134
uses PCI_BUIILD_BDF() which has bus << 8
The ACPI write is little endian, so bus ends up in byte 3 but should be in byte 2.
