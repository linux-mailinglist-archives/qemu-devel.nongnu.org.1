I don't know what's best either. 48 should be fine if hosts normally
enable VA_BITS_48 (I see debian has it [1], not sure how to find the
others).

It's not that low, since it gives each endpoint a private 512GB address
space, but yes there might be special cases that reach the limit. Maybe
assign a multi-queue NIC to a 256-vCPU guest, and if you want per-vCPU DMA
pools, then with a 39-bit address space you only get 2GB per vCPU. With
48-bit you get 1TB which should be plenty.

52-bit private IOVA space doesn't seem useful, I doubt we'll ever need to
support that on the MAP/UNMAP interface.

So I guess 48-bit can be the default, and users with special setups can
override aw-bits.

Thanks,
Jean
