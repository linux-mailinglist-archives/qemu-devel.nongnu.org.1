Will do.

I'll shuffle things around a bit whilst adding this to my staging
tree and first of all update the default (before the configuration
interface patch) to include this.  That patch will have some info
on backwards compatibility etc + ACPI tables updates (usual 3 patch
sequence to do that).

'll squash this patch into the generic restrictions configuration
interface patch.  That can then run separately wrt to
getting things upstreamed. It's a somewhat ugly interface at the
moment so that might needs some more involved discussion than
the BI support itself.
