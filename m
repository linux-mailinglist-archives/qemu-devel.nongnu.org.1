For me it would be a bit of trial an error as well. So here's my best guess:

Did you look at b193e5f9cccb322b0febd5a2aba486? You basically have to find out which files
are going to change due to extending the tests, so doing something like in that patch comes
after you found out which files are changing and iirc the tests are going to complain about
those files. So I would try to first add CRB tests similar to the following to tests/qtest/bios-tables-test.c.
in one patch, then run the test cases and they will tell you which files changed, and then
add a patch similar to b193e5f9cccb322b0febd5a2aba486 before the test-enabling patch.

             if (tpm_model_is_available("-machine q35", "tpm-tis")) {
                 qtest_add_func("acpi/q35/tpm2-tis", test_acpi_q35_tcg_tpm2_tis);
                 qtest_add_func("acpi/q35/tpm12-tis",
                                test_acpi_q35_tcg_tpm12_tis);
             }

I would try to something like the above to aarch64 here:

     } else if (strcmp(arch, "aarch64") == 0) {
         if (has_tcg && qtest_has_device("virtio-blk-pci")) {
             qtest_add_func("acpi/virt", test_acpi_virt_tcg);
             qtest_add_func("acpi/virt/acpihmatvirt",
                             test_acpi_virt_tcg_acpi_hmat);


Then you run the tests again then it should create those files with the ACPI data and you copy them
to their destination (like in ca745d2277496464b54fd832c15c45d0227325bb) and remove the changes from
tests/qtest/bios-tables-test-allowed-diff.h and that becomes your 3rd patch. Once you run the tests
again with the 3rd patch there should be no more complaints about ACPI related changes.

Since CRB ACPI tests are not enabled right now you can add these patches somewhere in the middle of
the series or also at the end.


I hope this helps.

    Stefan
