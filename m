That seems like the best option. Although just using the max CPU is
even better :)

As this is now a custom flag a separate rule is probably the way to
go. Something similar to the existing `RISCVCPUImpliedExtsRule` is
probably the way to go. Keep an implied rule for what is required by
the spec, but maybe a "helper" rule for the special flag?

A user can just specify max. It's just as much work as specifying this new =
flag.

Is the issue just the defaults? We can think about max CPU being the defaul=
t.

Urgh!
