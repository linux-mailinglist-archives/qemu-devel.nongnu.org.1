Agreed - the error logic to act as backpressure for the tool injecting
the error makes sense - it's just hardware acknowledging to paper
over slow software that is an issue.

Is this not better done in the injection code outside of qemu?
So detect the error in that and if it happens back off and try again
later?  Basically EBUSY done in an inelegant way.

If it happens on a real system nothing is done either. So I'm not sure
we need to handle that.  Or maybe real hardware reinjects the interrupt
if the OSPM hasn't done anything about it for a while.

Whilst I don't feel strongly about it, I think 5 is unfortunately the
correct option if we aren't going to queue errors in qemu (so make it
an injection tool problem).
