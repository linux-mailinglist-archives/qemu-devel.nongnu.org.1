It's the same for x86.
However anything above logical CPU level is not CPU devices,
but container devices. Even if you plugged whole socket,
in QEMU that would result in _STA evaluated on all leaf logical CPUs
and guest will online those CPUs individually.

Granularity here is irrelevant, it handles only vCPUs an nothing else.

If there were need to do something with containers (socket/cluster/...)
in hypothetical future, that should have it's own AML code instead of
abusing vCPU one, and well it certainly should be added only at that
time and not earlier.

Arch specific static AML is much simpler in this case, compared to callback=
s.
and this AML is still controlled by machine specific code, which
opts in into always_present cpus feature (it's machine that build's AML
code depending on options).

We do the same in x86, see other flags in CPUHotplugFeatures.
Guest opts in to change curtain parts of AML depending on machine config,
same should be done for ARM.

It doesn't need it now, isn't it?

When guest really needs to get presence flag dynamically in the future,
that's fine, but do introduce it at that time when it's actually used,
i.e. not for hypothetical case.

As one who wrote and takes care ACPI and cpuhp, I'd know what code is easier
to read/maintain in the arrea and to a lesser degree elsewhere in QEMU.

When it comes to arch specific side, I usually leave it upto arch maintaine=
rs
as they know specifics there much better.
(unless I notice something that is too much to look away and asks to for ba=
shing)

hooks do have it's use when logic they are executing is complex, dynamic and
differs a lot between impl, but indirection they introduce makes
reading code and maintaining it harder (debugging it becomes outright night=
mare).

Example: I did the same as you in the past, adding madt hook for some future
use, in several years it began to get in the way and eventually was removed.
Burden to clean up (possible in the future but not happened things) falls
on new contributors. Moral of story is: not over-engineer.

If hook can be replaced by config data and data driven code, I'd prefer
it from ease to read/maintainability point of view.

cleaner way is to use properties to access object state in arch agnostic wa=
y.
and cpuhp didn't access any cpu state before your bf1ecc8dad60619 commit
...
 -        val |=3D cdev->cpu ? 1 : 0;
 +        val |=3D check_cpu_enabled_status(DEVICE(cdev->cpu)) ? 1 : 0
...
poking into CPU internals (masked by helper function/hook) from another dev=
ice
that is not even parent of CPU, which is layer violation and
should be avoided if possible.

In case of cpuhp there is hotplug handlers infrastructure, to wire up
and connect things.
I particular, machine called acpi_cpu_plug_cb() which may access cpu,
and in your case it can check 'realized' property and store 'enabled'
state in AcpiCpuStatus state. It would be even better if it used
a dedicated property "enabled", instead of abusing 'realized' one.
And do opposite on unplug (can be done from unplug handler).

That was removed from AcpiCpuStatus, however
v3 does introduce present bit in register and callback to fetch it.
It is the same thing, just other way around.

I'm not arguing about 'enabled' in principle, only about the way it's
implemented. And that 'present' shouldn't be part of dynamic interface.

If you ever need present as dynamic in the future, introduce it at that
time along with patches that would use it.

if we'd follow this logic, we would have a QEMU with direct access across
different objects all over the place. That might work for small project
and avoid duplication, but that is very fragile and won't scale to
project of QEMU size.

And to configure devices we have init/property/hotplug handlers,
so that machine could connect separate objects together in meaning full
way and establish well known control flow.

that v6 series is not posted to the list, so it can disappear
or change any moment. Using it as reference is pointless.
There is no point to comment on something that is not on
the list as later on the github branch can be totally different
from what it was at the time comment was made.=20

That is also a reason why (v3) ARM cpuhp specific ACPI patches
shouldn't have been merged separately from main series.

It was fine when generic acpi cpu hotplug patches where posted as
separate series as those were working with several different RFCs
for cpuhp for different targets that would reuse it.
However posting ARM specific cpuhp acpi changes separately,
without actual user along with them only lead to confusion
and mess we have now.

I suggest you to send revert for merged v3,
and resend those (fixed up) patches as part of main series
where they can be properly reviewed.

(or I can sent it along with a couple of RFC patches doing
the same but in acceptable way from ACPI pov.
The later could be picked up into your next main series)

I did point to problems in the past (the latest was v2 review),
repeating it now again.

Design wise issue is that ARM architecture doesn't support
cpu hotplug. That's the reason why ARM kernel folks haven't
implemented it there since it's not what hardware does.
Quotes from [2]
  'There is no hardware that does anything of this.'
  'Whatever is defined for virtual machines needs to work on physical
   hardware too =E2=80=93 the OS doesn=E2=80=99t know its in a VM'

Above is also a good reason not to try implementing it on
QEMU side as hotplug as well.

My suggestion was to try instead standby CPUs concept
that ARM does support, which looks like hotplug on
guest side (kernel largely freely mixes up hotplug term
with CPUs onlining).

The only reply I got to this:
unsure, and 'requirements' as if it set in stone and pushed on
QEMU using some presentations [2] as reference, which is basically
a set of issues and wishes plus some ideas how it could be achieved.
Those wishes are by no means any form of consensus on how things should be.

  * 'must reuse device_add/del for smooth transition from x86'

     this one I guess comes from flowing quote:
       'Should have look-and-feel of x86_64 platform VCPU hot-plug feature'
       and then accompanied kernel presentation phrase:
         'No appetite for updating numerous specifications to describe hotp=
lug support'

     On that one can easily counter:
       'then make it virt hardware behave like x86 and write specs for it,
        instead of hacking the heck out of QEMU'

     But that is beside the point, management software can easily adapt
     to dedicated QMP command to online CPUs without abusing device_add/del.
     ARM's 'cpu hotplug' doesn't have to be drop in replacement for ARM,
     you do configure ARM VM differently, you can do 'hotplug'
     differently as well, nothing prevents it beside having a will to do it.

  * 'for large VM to start fast'
       that one I guess, comes from following phrase:
          'allowing for faster boot time'
       but whole bullet point talks about scalability
          'Kata Containers VM starts with a minimum amount of resources, (h=
ot-plug everything)'
       that somehow turned in to requirement:
         'start VM as fast as if real CPU hotplug is supported regardless o=
f the costs'
       as result main series hack is to avoid creation of possible CPUs,
       Depending on series revision it ranged from creation of half initial=
ized vCPU
       objects and then deleting them to creating half initialized vCPU
       and letting them dangle in memory without completing its creation
       in the latest series incarnation (v6). And all of that is to avoid
       calling expensive in current impl. cpu_realize.
       The rest series is some necessary boiler plate code + other hacks
       trying to convince the rest of QEMU that dangling half initialized C=
PU objects
       are nothing to worry about.=20

     well with standby cpu design you can also have 'allowing for faster bo=
ot time'
     it is not as fast as x86 with its hotplug but still faster than onlini=
ng
     all possible CPUs at boot time on guest side.
     Even 'faster startup' wish is stretching things, one just puts off del=
ays
     to a later time in guest lifetime where every single vCPU hotplug
     incurs even bigger time penalty as guest kernel has to stop everything
     to hotplug a CPU.

     The point is: 'standby cpus' design also leads to faster boot
     on guest side compared normal boot with all vCPUs.
     As for comparing with even faster x86, fix cpu_realize to be
     faster (as I demonstrated in v2 review) or fix design to
     implement real hotplug [1], instead of another quote from [2]
          'Creative Hack =E2=80=93 Which Works! Really?'

So my suggestion to try 'standby cpus' approach still stays,
fully realizing CPUs.
Also, you can't reuse device_add with it as that means you'd be forced to
hack workflow one way or another for what it wasn't designed.
Add a new QMP command instead 'device-on/device-off' that
would fit standby concept better.

You will very likely end up with much simpler series that it's now,
probably even more simple than recent loongarch cpu hotplug [3]

PS:
1) If hotplug support is really need, try to convince ARM
to implement it (as minimum for virt environment,
that likely would require some spec & kernel work first).
Or wait until business needs wake up ARM's appetite to do it right.

   and compare with ARM RFC,
   it looks much more cleaner and strait-forward than ARM variant when one
   doesn't need hack QEMU here and there to make it work.

PS3:
  joke:
     typical QEMU maintainer response to large series
       'rewrite half of QEMU 1st, then do you thing and we will see'
     ARM cpuhp gets much milder treatment
       'rewrite your series in other way that matches real world'
