I ran into something similar recently [1], and it was a pain to 
reproduce it. Luckily, I caught it using rr and could debug it, but it 
would have been much easier to just get a backtrace of the crash.

In this case, it was a segmentation fault, which is not covered by 
current patch. Which brings me the thought I share at the end of this email.

For developers working on crashes/bug fix, it's definitely a good 
addition (could come with --enable-debug for sure). It's something we 
could enable in CI by default too. Usually, with sanitizers, the 
reported stacktrace is enough to get a rough idea of what the problem 
is, without having to use any debugger.

Regarding the outside world and users, I share Daniel's opinion that it 
would be too verbose if a backtrace is emitted with every fatal error 
message.

However, I think it could have *incredible* value if we reported this 
backtrace when QEMU segfaults, which is always something exceptional.
In this case, we could always enable this.
It's not covered by the current patch, maybe it could be a great addition?

Regarding binary size increase due to -rdynamic, I already know some 
people won't like it, so I'm not sure how we can ensure to have useful 
symbols in distributed binaries, which is a harder debate than enabling 
backtraces on segfaults or not.
