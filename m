Can you elaborate more? I was thinking something like follows:
1. Prepare a QEMU command line.
2. Run the command line appended with -dump-platform on all hosts, which 
dumps platform features automatically enabled. For virtio devices, we 
can dump "host_features" variable.
3. Run the command line appended with -merge-platform with all dumps. 
For most virtio devices, this would be AND operations on "host_features" 
variable.
4. Run the command line appended with -use-platform with the merged 
dump. This will run VMs with features available on all hosts.

I may have missed something but this seems good enough for me. Of course 
this requires changes throughout the stack (QEMU common and 
device-specific code, libvirt, and even higher layers like OpenStack).
