Exactly. This is better wording since it doesn't necessarily have to be 
sent at the "start" of stage 2. Just at some point during it.

We pretty much need, more or less, all of the state of the VirtIODevice 
itself as well as the bits of the VirtIONet device. Essentially, barring 
ring indices, we'd need whatever is required throughout most of the 
device's startup routine.

In this series, we get everything we need from the vmstate_save_state(f, 
&vmstate_virtio_net, ...) and vmstate_load_state(f, &vmstate_virtio_net, 
...) calls early during stage 1 (see patch 4/6).

Once we've gotten this data, we can start on the prep work that's 
normally done today during stage 2.

Correct.

If, for some reason, the guest wanted to change everything during 
migration (specifically during stage 1), then it'd more or less negate 
the early prep work we'd've done. How impactful this is would depend on 
which route we go (see below). God forbid the guest just wait until 
migration is complete.

> If yes, how do you handle this?
> 

So it depends on the route this series goes. That is, whether we go the 
truly iterative SaveVMHandlers hooks route (which this series uses) or 
if we go the early_setup VMSD route (which Peter recommended).

---

If we go the truly iterative route, then technically we can still handle 
these changes during stage 1 and still keep the work out of stage 2.

However, given the nicheness of such a corner case (where things are 
being changed last minute during migration), handling these changes 
iteratively might be overdesign.

And we'd have to guard against the scenario where the guest acts 
maliciously by constantly changing things to prevent migration from 
continuing.

---

If we go the early_setup VMSD route, where we get one shot early to do 
stuff during stage 1 and one last shot to do things later during stage 
2, then the more that gets changed means the less beneficial this early 
work becomes. This is because any changes made during stage 1 could only 
be handled during stage 2, which is what this overall effort is trying 
to minimize.

> 

When it comes to early migration for devices, we can never support a "no 
change" design assumption. The difference in the design lies in how (and 
when) such changes are handled during migration.

Will do.

>>>> I don't believe the source/destination could be aware of the misconfiguration. IIUC the destination reads the migration stream and expects certain pieces of data in a certain order. If new data is added to the migration stream or the order has changed and the destination isn't expecting it, then the migration fails. It doesn't know exactly why, just that it read-in data that it wasn't expecting.

Right.

So if we pin this feature to always be enabled for machine type, say, >= 
pc-q35-XX.X, then can we assume that both guests can actually support 
this feature?

In other words, conversely, is it possible in production that both 
guests use pc-q35-XX.X but one build supports this early migration 
feature and the other doesn't?

If we can assume that, then this would probably be the right approach 
for something like this.

Given that migration can only be done with matching machine types and if 
we can assume that guests using pc-q35-XX.X, for example, will always 
have this support, then my concerns about this are allayed.
