It turns out to be a KVM bug.

The gpa passed in in KVM_PRE_FAULT_MEMORY, i.e., range->gpa has no 
indication for share vs. private. KVM directly passes range->gpa to 
kvm_tdp_map_page() in kvm_arch_vcpu_pre_fault_memory(), which is then 
assigned to fault.addr

However, fault.addr is supposed to be a gpa of real access in TDX guest, 
which means it needs to have shared bit set if the map is for shared 
access, for TDX case. tdp_mmu_get_root_for_fault() will use it to 
determine which root to be used.

For this case, the pre fault is on the shared memory, while the 
fault.addr leads to mirror_root which is for private memory. Thus it 
triggers KVM_BUG_ON().
