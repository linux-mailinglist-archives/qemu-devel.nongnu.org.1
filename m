This patch seems to me to do what the commit message sets out to
do, and it looks unlikely to have any unintended side effects
because it turns a "USB controller flags an error" case into
a "treat as zero length packet" case, and I have trouble
imagining that any guest could be relying on looking for the
controller error. On that basis I'm inclined to accept it.

What I would like to see is what we could classify under
"rationale", which is to say "what prompted us to make this
change?". In my experience it's important to record this
(including in the commit message). There are of course
many cases in QEMU's git history where we failed to do that,
but in general I think it's a good standard to meet. (I
am also erring on the side of caution in reviewing this
particular patch, because I don't know the relevant standards
or this bit of the code very well.)

Why do we care about the motivation for a patch?

(1) In the present: it helps to raise confidence that the
proposed new behaviour is right. This is good because QEMU's
test suite is far from comprehensive, so in some sense any
change to the codebase is a risk.

For instance, if a change is being made because the QNX demo
floppy doesn't run, then the fact that the change fixes that
failure-to-run indicates that our interpretation of the
meaning of the standard, or of what should happen in the
grey areas that the documentation doesn't clearly describe,
matches what the QNX driver author (an unrelated third party)
thought and probably also what a lot of in-the-field hardware
does (since QNX was no doubt tested on a lot of different PCs
back in the day).

On the other hand, if a change is proposed because it fixes
booting with older Linux kernels prior to commit XYZ, and
kernel commit XYZ turns out to be "make this device driver
program the hardware according to the specification rather
than relying on an accident of timing", then we might want
to look at where we want to be in the tradeoff of "run older
kernels" versus "put workaround for a guest software issue
into QEMU". (Workarounds for guest software bugs are something
I'm very reluctant to put into QEMU, because my experience
is that once they're in the codebase we can essentially never
remove them, because we don't know what guest code might
be relying on them. But sometimes they're a necessary evil.)

(2) In the future: if in a year's time or more, somebody
reports that a particular commit has regressed some specific
guest workload they have, knowing why we made the change in
the first place is really useful in investigating the
regression.

If we need to change code that was initially added to solve
a problem when running FreeBSD, we know we need to re-test
with FreeBSD.

If the change went in to fix a buffer overrun, we know we
need to be careful and cross-check that we don't reintroduce
the overrun in the course of fixing a regression.

If a change is one that we made on the grounds of "reading
the spec and the code, this looked like it was clearly wrong,
but we don't have a definite repro case of it breaking a guest"
then that might put "revert the change, we were mistaken" on
the table as a response to a future regression report.
And so on.

thanks
