Hmm.  The _GNU_SOURCE guard was deliberately removed in 
25e6fee27f4a293728dd15b659170e7b9c7db9bc (see below).  IMO the relevant 
text is "portable software should be prepared for them not to exist" and 
" the intent is that this be a very short-term measure and that the 
macros be removed entirely in the next release cycle."  They're still 
there, guarded by only _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE.  I will bring up the 
question about what the future plan for this is on the musl list, but I 
also think that the appropriate, portable thing to do is to change the 
test case regardless of musl's plans.  If there were some other 
conformant C library it could implement it the same way.  IIUC the 
relevant specification is here 
https://unix.org/version2/whatsnew/lfs20mar.html


commit 25e6fee27f4a293728dd15b659170e7b9c7db9bc
Author: Rich Felker <dalias@aerifal.cx>
Date:   Tue Sep 27 15:04:05 2022 -0400

     remove LFS64 programming interfaces (macro-only) from _GNU_SOURCE

     these badly pollute the namespace with macros whenever _GNU_SOURCE is
     defined, which is always the case with g++, and especially tends to
     interfere with C++ constructs.

     as our implementation of these was macro-only, their removal cannot
     affect any existing binaries. at the source level, portable software
     should be prepared for them not to exist.

     for now, they are left in place with explicit _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE.
     this provides an easy temporary path for integrators/distributions to
     get packages building again right away if they break while working on
     a proper, upstreamable fix. the intent is that this be a very
     short-term measure and that the macros be removed entirely in the next
     release cycle.
