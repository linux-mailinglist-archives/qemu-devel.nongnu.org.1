While some extensions will impact the machine model, as well as cpu
models, versioning the machine model won't help much with ambiguity in
cpu model extension support. Daniel's proposal of having a base cpu mode,
which, on top, users can explicitly enable what they want (including with
profile support which work like a shorthand to enable many extensions at
once), is, IMO, the best way for users to know what they get. Also, the
'max' cpu model is the best way to "quickly get as much as possible" for
testing. To know what's in 'max', or named cpu models, we need to
implement qmp_query_cpu_model_expansion(). Something that could be used
from the command line would also be nice, but neither x86 nor arm provide
that (they have '-cpu help', but arm doesn't output anything for cpu
features and x86 dumps all features out without saying what's enabled for
any particular cpu model...)

I know x86 people have in the past discussed versioning cpu models, but
I don't think that should be necessary for riscv with the base+profile
approach. A profile would effectively be a versioned cpu model in that
case.

Finally, I'd discourage versioning the virt machine type until we need
to worry about users creating riscv guest images that they are unwilling
to modify, despite wanting to update their QEMU versions. And, even then,
we should only consider versioning when we're aware of problems for those
static guest images, i.e. we introduce a change to the virt machine model
which breaks that supported, old guest image. (NB: It was me that
advocated to start versioning Arm's virt machine type. In hindsight, I
think I may have advocated prematurely. I'm trying not to make that
mistake twice!)

If the virt machine type has a default cpu type, then why not set it to
'max'?
