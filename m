I think the register access probably provides everything you need. Some
targets provide a wider access than other though. I haven't looked at
the Risc V code but certainly the Arm code exposes pretty much all
system registers to the gdbstub (and hence the plugin interface).

If there is example of state that isn't accessible this way then I'd
like to know it.

There are some dragons with pc/npc as each front-end deals with it its
own way and some targets have delay slots which makes things even
messier.

No lets keep it simple for the first iteration. We can also expand the
API later and bump the API versions as appropriate.
