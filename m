I suppose that the result of open("/dev/udmabuf", O_RDWR) and the 
UDMABUF_CREATE_LIST ioctl is always compatible with mmap(). Not sure 
what you mean by "direct" interface, but they are all plain userspace 
interfaces.

I suggest asking people maintaining the udmabuf and the DMA-BUF 
infrastructure if you know them.

Just clarification; QEMU will not break in that case only if this patch 
is applied, am I right?
