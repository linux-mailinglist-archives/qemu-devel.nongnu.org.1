Yes, I guess this would be inevitable in the future. But right now the=20

So far we can only work with what Intel is giving us i.e Package power=20
plane and DRAM power plane on server, which is the main target of=20
this feature. Maybe in the future, Intel will expand the core power=20
plane and the uncore power plane to server class CPU ?

Same answer as above: uncore/graphics power plane is only available on=20
client class CPU.=20

Indeed, depending on where your vCPUs are running within the package (on=20
the native or sibling CPU), you might observe different power=20
consumption levels. However, I don't consider this to be a problem, as=20
the ratio calculation takes into account the vCPU's location.

We also need to approach the measurement differently. Due to the=20
complexity of factors influencing power consumption, we must compare=20
what is comparable. If you require precise power consumption data,=20
use a power meter on the PSU of the server.It will provide the=20
ultimate judgment. However, if you need an estimation to optimize=20
software workloads in a guest, then this feature could be useful. All my=20
tests have consistently shown reproducible output in terms of power=20
consumption, which has convinced me that we can effectively work with=20
it.

Fair enough, I can rename this like that.

This is totally dependant of KVM because it used the KVM MSR Filtering=20
to access userspace when a specific MSR is required.

I can try to find a way to use -cpu for this feature and check if KVM is=20
activated or not.=20

I've evaluated such things with another tool called Kepler [1]. This=20
tool calculate the power ratio with metrics from RAPL and uses either=20
eBPF or the tick based systems for time metrics. The eBPF part [2] is=20
triggered on each 'finish_task_switch' of Thread and calculate the delta=20
of cpu cycle, cache miss, cpu time, etc. Very complex. My tests showed=20
that the difference between using eBPF and tick based ratio is really=20
not that important. Maybe on some special cases, using eBPF would show=20
a way better accuracy but I'm not aware of that.

Yes it could be possible. But what I wanted to avoid with my approach is=20
the overhead it could take when accessing a RAPL MSR in the Guest.
The value is always available and return very quickly.=20
I'm not sure about the overhead if we have to have to access the MSR,=20
then do the calculation and so on.

I'm a bit concerned about the potential overflow in calculation if the=20

Right, I've missed that totally. Thanks for let me know.

But this is exactly what it is intended to do. Wether it is MSR of TPMI,=20
checking this, tell me that RAPL is activated or not. If it is=20
activated...

... then it is safe to access the RAPL MSR. I would not like to access=20
this on a XYZ cpu without knowing I can !

Alright. I take not on that and I will check the die approach.

Thanks a lot for all your feedback Zhao !
