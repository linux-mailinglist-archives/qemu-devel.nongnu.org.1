>=20I respect your personal preference, but our conversation should be ba=
sed on arguments, and not only tastes.
>=20
>=20The important thing, from my point of view, is that the API stays eas=
y to use and clear for the user. Having multiple callbacks is a headache,=
 because you can't clearly group them somewhere, and force the user to im=
plement all of them at once.

Having only one callback is not something I'm against.

If you cannot rely on an input being a sensible value, doesn't that
render the input useless?

 The testing part can be solved already (as explained in a previous messa=
ge). In which cases can't you identify from_pc?

I'll have to check, but problems that I discussed with a colleague
included jumps to an unmapped page resulting in the appropriate
exception. We ultimately agreed that in such a situation from_pc should
point to the jump target inside the unmapped page, instead of, say, the
jump. We assume that most targets should already behave this way without
further changes. However, in order to compute the correct from_pc, we
need to know the jump target before the exception is raised (i.e. right
after the jump instruction is executed), and that's not necessarily
straight-forward to do in a plugin.

But as I wrote before in another message, I need to take another look at
the cflow plugin.

> By the way, and if you are open to talk about naming.

I'm open to suggestions.

> I understand why you picked up discontinuity, which is coming from a ma=
thematical background. However, I rarely see this term used in the litera=
ture for computer science, and people use "exceptional control flow" to q=
ualify interrupts and traps. In more, when we'll integrate classic contro=
l flow (including fallback between tb), the term discontinuity will lose =
its meaning. For this reason, I think that {cflow,CFLOW} makes more sense=
.

Using the term "discontinuity" was, in fact, inspired by "uninferable PC
discontinuities" defined in the RISC-V ETrace spec [1], arguably a
technical document. We chose discontinuity over the notion of control
flow because the PC is not the (only) thing affected by the event. In
the case of host calls, we ideally don't even observe an effect on the
PC. Thus control flow doesn't really fit the bill for those.
