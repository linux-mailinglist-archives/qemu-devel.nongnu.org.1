Isn't keeping the default AUTO the same as before when it used to be ON?  I
mean, AUTO in a qemu cmdline doesn't guarantee guest API either.

Indeed it looks like it's a step forward to make ON having the clear
semantics of "fail when unsupported".  It's just that I am not sure how
useful is AUTO here, because anyway we'll need to break ON semantics even
with AUTO, so that an old QEMU script with USO=ON used to boot on old
kernels but not it won't.

What I was trying to say is whether we should make the default parameter to
be migratable.  IOW, it looks to me AUTO should deserve a migration
blocker when chosen.

After all, Libvirt hopefully shouldn't use AUTO at all but only ON/OFF,
while any user when not caring much on these perf details should always use
OFF on any kernel dependent features that may affect the guest ABI.

Thanks,
