v2:
 - To make this easier to merge, shuffle patches so that the MCTP over I2C
   transport can be in a later patch set once the prerequisites are in
   place.
 - Various fixes identified by tightening up and expanding the test code
   http://gitlab.com/jic23/cxl-fmapi-tests
   Instructions on how to use this can also be found in that repository.
 - Expanded command support so that each CCI can support a more
   representative command set (variable length payloads in both directions).
   Note we are not yet at the point of having implemented the required
   commands, let alone all the optional ones. Adding all those commands in
   an initial command set would have been far to large to review.
 - A few changes (mostly in comments and patch descriptions) reflecting
   answers to CXL specification queries.

I haven't picked up Gregory's tags as I've made a lot of changes and
as such he may want to retest the niagara support on this.
Similarly I've dropped some of Fan Ni's tags due to changes in particular
patches.

Updated v1 message:

I've been carrying most of this series on our CXL staging tree
https://gitlab.com/jic23/qemu for some time and a lot of more recent
work around Multi Head Devices and Dynamic Capacity that we need for
Linux kernel enabling are backed up behind it. Hence I reorganized my
queue to try and land this before other less 'central' features such
as CXL PMUs and arm/virt support.

This series is focused on enabling the Fabric Management aspects of
CXL to enable orchestration and tooling development and also
to enable testing of related kernel features.

Features:
1. Rework the Component Command Interface (CCI) implementation to extract
   generic parts from the existing CXL Primary Mailbox (in PCI BAR
   space).
2. Add CXL Switch Mailbox CCI function support. This CXL r3.0 feature
   enables an in band PCI path to control switch configuration.
   It is basically a CXL primary mailbox in a separate PCI function.
   On many systems this would be wired to a BMC, but as it is a normal
   PCI function we can make it an option for an emulated host providing
   us with a useful interface for testing some fabric management
   features of CXL. In particular this will be useful for tunneling
   Fabric Management commands to Type 3 memory devices (via
   MCTP over PCI VDM)
3. The afore mentioned tunneling support. Note this exercises most of
   the paths that will also be used by the CXL FMAPI/Device MCTP over
   I2C series when posted.
4. A set of example commands to explore how to get access to various
   information. Additional commands will be added in future series.
   This one is big enough already!  One or two bits are made up for now.
   Fidelity may therefore improve in future patch sets.
5. Davidlohr's work on background operations (only for the CXL type 3
   primary mailbox for now. This wasn't directly related to the above
   series but was based on the early rework and is a simple feature.
   Background support for the Switch Mailbox CCI is left for future
   series.

A typical Qemu command line snippet for testing these...
