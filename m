We would pick an arbitrary endianness of our choosing
I guess. How does this work in physical machines ? Is
the choice of endianess a firmware setting, or a choice
by the vendor when manufacturing in some way ?

Picking an arbitrary endianess is compatible with our
test suite, it just has the implication that we would
only end up testing the machine in a single endianness
configuration.

If we wanted to test both endianness options, the test
would need amending to know to try both values of the
endian property on the machine.

If we have prior art like this, then remaining consistentv is
desirable and thus my comments are too late.

With x86 there's no need for mode=32. Whether the machine
supports 64-bit or not is a property of the CPU model
chosen. eg  "qemu -M pc -cpu Nehalem" would be 64-bit and
"qemu -M pc -cpu pentium" would be 32-bit.

The qemu-system-i386 binary is pretty much pointless as a
separate thing. Libvirt will happily use qemu-system-x86_64
to run 32-bit guests, by just specifying a 32-bit CPU
model
