A discussion w/libvirt developers would be prudent.
I don't think it's that complicated and lots of parallels to device-assigned pcie devices & virtio-devices,
but for possibly different reasons: for pci(e) assigned devices, need to add (hw-centric) RP's and pcie bus's;
virtio devices can share a (n emulated) PCI.

for smmu: devices assigned can be attached to an smmu, which libvirt can have accel=auto added to it, on
a separate smmu than those added to virtio devices(sharing that smmu).  Each assigned device can have a
unique smmu-id, like assigned PCI(e) devices have unique pci-id (pcie is one-device/one-bus, of course)
but the assigned devices may actually use the same smmu (physically, even though virtually defined as separate).
If we end up with too many smmu's b/c we have successfully exploited their advanced features
for assigned devices in guests, I'll consider that a win! ;-)
Seriously, I'm sure we can figure out how to improve the libvirt smmu/iommu assignment of (assigned) devices to (virtual) smmu's/iommu's
with a bit more hw-tree lookup code.

I look forward to the discussion with the libvirt developers.
