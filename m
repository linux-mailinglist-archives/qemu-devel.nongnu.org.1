I was not seeing it like that.

I was treating per-device parameter to be a flag showing whether the device
is capable of passing over FDs, which is more like a device attribute.

Those things (after set by machine type) should never change, and the only
thing to be changed is the global "backend-transfer" boolean that can be
set in the "migrate" QMP command, and should be decided by the admin when
one wants to initiate the migration process.

I doubt whether we would really need that in reality.

Likely the admin should only worry about whether setting the global
"backend-transfer", the admin may not even need to know which device, and
how many devices, will be beneficial to this feature enabled.

It just says, "we're doing local migration and via unix sockets, so
whatever devices can try to reuse their backends if possible".
