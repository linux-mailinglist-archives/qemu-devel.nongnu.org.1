Sometimes one must modify the command line arguments passed to new QEMU.
This interface allows for that possibility.

In an earlier patch series, I proposed a cpr-exec command that took no arguments,
and reused the old QEMU argv, which was remembered in main.  A reviewer pointed out
how inflexible that was.  See my response to Daniel yesterday for more on the value
of this flexibility.

This is not a burden for the mgmt agent.  It already knows the arguments because
it can launch new qemu with the arguments for live migration.  Passing the arguments
to cpr-exec-command is trivial.

Here is the guest pause time, measured as the interval from the start
of the migrate command to the new QEMU guest reaching the running state.
The average over 10 runs is shown, in msecs.
Huge pages are enabled.
Guest memory is memfd.
The kernel is 6.9.0  (not UEK, so no parallel unmap)
The system is old and slow: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2699 v4 @ 2.20GHz

         cpr-exec    cpr-transfer
256M    180         148
16G     190         150
128G    250         159
1T      300 ?       159 ?                // extrapolated

At these scales, the difference between exec and transfer is not significant.
A provider would choose one vs the other based on ease of implementation in
their mgmt agent and container environment.

For small pages and large memory, cpr-exec can take multiple seconds, and
the UEK parallel unmap reduces that further.  But, that is the exception,
not the rule.  Providers strive to back huge memories with huge pages.  It
makes no sense to use such a valuable resource in the crappiest way possible
(ie with small pages).

I will more deeply study reconnects in the mgmt layer, run some experiments to
see if it is seamless for the end user, and get back to you, but it will take
some time.

OCI - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
Mgmt needs to manage reconnections for live migration, and perhaps I could
leverage that code for live update, but happily I did not need to.  Regardless,
reconnection is the lesser issue.  The bigger issue is resource management and
the container environment.  But I cannot justify that statement in detail without
actually trying to implement cpr-transfer in OCI.

The use case is the same for both modes, but they are simply different
transport methods for moving descriptors from old QEMU to new.  The developer
of the mgmt agent should be allowed to choose.
