Hmm, yes, that is a pretty unpleasant approach.

IMHO there really needs to be a reference implementation that is
pure software. eg a gmt_0018_2012.so + header files that simply
uses an existing crypto library. That way applications can build
and test their support for this, without having to have access
to a specific piece of hardware. Hardware vendors should only
have to provide their library impl, not the headers.

Daniel
