I wonder if starting with a device implementation is perhaps the
wrong idea, in terms of a practical yet simple first step.

As devices go, the pl011 device is simple, but compared to other
QOM impls in QEMU, devices are still relatively complex things,
especially if we want to write against safe abstraction.

How about we go simpler still, and focus on one of the object
backends. For example, the RNG backend interface is practically
the most trivial QOM impl we can do in QEMU. It has one virtual
method that needs to be implemented, which is passed a callback
to receive entropy, and one native method to call to indicate
completion.

Providing a safe Rust abstraction for implementing an RNG
backend looks like a much quicker proposition that a safe
abstraction for implementing a device. The various RNG impls
have a few places where they touch other QEMU code (rng-builtin
uses qemu_bh, rng-egd lightly touches chardev APIs, rng-random
touches main loop FD handlers). Each of those things though, are
small & useful API problems to look it solving.

If we did this I think we would not have to give a "free pass"
for a hackish C-like first Rust impl. We would have something
designed well from day 1, showing small, but tangible benefits,
with a path to incrementally broadening the effort.

With regards,
Daniel
