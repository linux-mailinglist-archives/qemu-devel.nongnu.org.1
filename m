I see.  I am not familiar with the status quo there, so I'll leave that to
you and other experts that know better on this..

Personally I do care more on Linux, as that's what we ship within RH..

Ah ok.  But note that there's still a slight difference: we need to avoid
AUTO being an option, at all, IMHO.

It's about making qemu cmdline the ABI: when with AUTO it's still possible
the user uses AUTO on both sides, then ABI may not be guaranteed.

AUTO would be fine if: (1) the property doesn't affect guest ABI, or (2)
the AUTO bit will always generate the same thing on both hosts.  However
USO* isn't such case.. so the AUTO option is IMHO not wanted.

What I mentioned above "x-virtio-net-offload-enforce" shouldn't add
anything new to "uso"; it still can only be ON/OFF.  However it should
affect "flip that to OFF automatically" or "fail the boot" behavior on
missing features.

Basically you're saying that no-cross-migrate has lower priority than
specific feature bits.  That's OK to me.
