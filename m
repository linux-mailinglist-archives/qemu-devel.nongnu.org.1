Well that'll remove the burden for the non-TLS incoming migration,
but the incoming TLS migration will still have the redundant
yields and so still suffer a hit.

Given where we are in freeze, I'm thinking we should just hard
disable the workaround for this release, and re-attempt it in
next cycle and then we can bring it back to stable afterwards.
