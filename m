The scenarios where zeroing is not required (incoming migration and
-loadvm) share a common characteristic: the VM has not yet run in the
current QEMU process.
To avoid splitting read=5Framblock=5Fmapped=5Fram(), could we implement
a check to determine if the VM has ever run and decide whether to zero
the memory based on that? Maybe using RunState?

Then we can add something like this to read=5Framblock=5Fmapped=5Fram()
...
clear=5Fbit=5Fidx =3D 0;
for (...) {
    // Zero pages
    if (guest=5Fhas=5Fever=5Frun()) {
        unread =3D TARGET=5FPAGE=5FSIZE * (set=5Fbit=5Fidx - clear=5Fbi=
t=5Fidx);
        offset =3D clear=5Fbit=5Fidx << TARGET=5FPAGE=5FBITS;
        host =3D host=5Ffrom=5Fram=5Fblock=5Foffset(block, offset);
        if (!host) {...}
        ram=5Fhandle=5Fzero(host, unread);
    }
    // Non-zero pages
    clear=5Fbit=5Fidx =3D find=5Fnext=5Fzero=5Fbit(bitmap, num=5Fpages,=
 set=5Fbit=5Fidx + 1);
...
(Plus trailing zero pages handling)

It makes sense, but special handling for zero pages instead of simply
ORing the two maps could improve performance.
If dirty =3D true and file=5Fbmap =3D false, instead of reading the zer=
o
page from the snapshot I can simply memset to 0 as above.

Enjoy your vacation :)

Thank you.
