In theory we are already distinguishing those cases. In the logs above,
the stack traces come from a part of the code that indicates we have
successfully downloaded the asset and now try to validate the result
and failed.

If the connection is terminating early, then our logic at:

                with tmp_cache_file.open("xb") as dst:
                    with urllib.request.urlopen(self.url) as resp:
                        copyfileobj(resp, dst)

does not appear to be seeing a fatal error, otherwise we would
have seen the log from

            except Exception as e:
                self.log.error("Unable to download %s: %s", self.url, e)
                tmp_cache_file.unlink()
                raise

and would never have got as far as comparing the checksums.

So I'm wondering if 'copyfileobj' is not reliable in detecting
premature termination of the http connection before all data
has been sent. 

With regards,
Daniel
