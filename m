Relevant part of docs/about/build-platforms.rst:

    Some build dependencies may follow less conservative rules:

    Python runtime
      Distributions with long-term support often provide multiple versions
      of the Python runtime.  While QEMU will initially aim to support the
      distribution's default runtime, it may later increase its minimum version
      to any newer python that is available as an option from the vendor.
      In this case, it will be necessary to use the ``--python`` command line
      option of the ``configure`` script to point QEMU to a supported
      version of the Python runtime.

      As of QEMU |version|, the minimum supported version of Python is 3.9.

    Python build dependencies
      Some of QEMU's build dependencies are written in Python.  Usually these
      are only packaged by distributions for the default Python runtime.
      If QEMU bumps its minimum Python version and a non-default runtime is
      required, it may be necessary to fetch python modules from the Python
      Package Index (PyPI) via ``pip``, in order to build QEMU.

We "initially aim to support the distribution's default runtime".  Once
we don't, fetching from PyPI "may be necessary".  This seems to imply
that such fetching will be necessary when we use the default runtime.

I read "aim" as "make an effort".  This isn't exactly a "guarantee".
It's much, much weaker than "to preserve, without fail, our ability to
perform fully offline builds on all supported platforms".

Keeping fully offline builds working is certainly desirable, but not
regardless of cost.

You have: few people have noticed your work.

I do not think such a commitment exists; see my reading of
build-platforms.rst above.

Even if it did, treating it as iron-clad would be foolish.  We need to
consider cost vs. reward, always.

I believe the value of fully offline builds goes down as the build
platform ages.

Initially, the distribution will (hopefully!) want to package the then
current version of QEMU.  We want to make that easy.  Enabling fully
offline builds are part of that.

Perhaps the distribution later wants to package / build newer versions
of QEMU fully offline on the now aged release.  I'd expect this to
happen less and less as the distribution ages.  Making it easy is still
desirable, but worth less and less trouble to us.

In my opinion: none.  We should consider the tradeoffs, and make
pragmatic decisions.
