I had indeed=C2=A0looked into this back in 2023 and even did some work on
it, but unfortunately I had abandoned it before getting to the finish
line.

From what I remember, I found that the patches didn't merge cleanly, so
I attempted to reconcile them with the changes made in QEMU master
since the original patches were submitted. As part of that work, I felt
that I needed to take responsibility for the patches, the same way I
would for a patch I wrote on my own.

Due to my yak shaving tendencies, I got distracted by several things. I
ended up investigating a test failure caused by a bug in unrelated code
(which I reported as issue #1969). I wrote terminal size detection code
for Windows. And I remember there being something in the patches that I
wasn't really happy about and intended to rewrite, but I never got
around to doing that. After a while, I lost my enthusiasm, and because
I had other things to worry about, this work ended up just sitting
there on my SSD for almost two years.

So anyway, for now I have now uploaded my version of the patches here:
https://gitlab.com/filip-hejsek/qemu/-/commits/console-resize-old

I will try to merge it with the current master again, which should be
ready in a short time. I can't promise much more than that, though. :)

Best regards,
Filip Hejsek
