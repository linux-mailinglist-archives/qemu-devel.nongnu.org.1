Every patch to 'guest-exec' takes us torwards re-inventing yet more
SSH/telnet functionality, but a poor simulation of it. For exmaple
this still lacks any separation of stdout/stderr streams, just
interleaving all their data back to the host. There is also zero
access control facilities beyond turning off the 'guest-exec'
command entirely.

IMHO we should really consider "arbitrary command execution" to be
something to be handled by a separate process. Let the guest OS admin
decide separately from running QEMU GA, whether they want to enable
arbitrary host processes to have a trival privileged backdoor into
their guest.

systemd now supports exposing SSH over VSOCK, and provides an SSH
proxy in the host to connect to VMs, while libvirt also has added
its own host SSH proxy to allow SSH based on libvirt VM name.

For windows guests, there is something called PowerShell Direct
which exposes PowerShell over vmbus under HyperV. Possibly that
can be enabled in QEMU too if someone understands windows & vmbus
enough... ?

With regards,
Daniel
