With 'spice' you mean only that the builtin will not get any more codecs 
right? because I want to do an MR for spice gstreamer to add more 
codecs, like av1.

Also It might be useful to set more parameters in future, like chroma 
sub-sampling or which GStreamer plugin is wanted like: msdk, va, vaapi....

Another point is that it can actually be a list of codecs like:
gstreamer:vp8;gstreamer:h264;spice:mjpeg

Which is maybe not clear from the current documentation, which might 
rather be:
[,video-codecs=<encoder>:<codec>[;...]]

This is useful the specify the allowed codecs and also set the priority.
