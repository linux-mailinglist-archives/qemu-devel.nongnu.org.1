During the development of a patch series meant to allow GHESv2 error injections,
it was requested a change on how CPER offsets are calculated, by adding a new
BIOS pointer and reworking the GHES logic. See:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/cover.1726293808.git.mchehab+huawei@kernel.org/

Such change ended being a big patch, so several intermediate steps are needed,
together with several cleanups and renames.

As agreed during v10 review, I'll be splitting the big patch series into separate pull 
requests, starting with the cleanup series. This is the first patch set, containing
only such preparation patches.

The next series will contain the shift to use offsets from the location of the
HEST table, together with a migration logic to make it compatible with 9.1.

---

v5:
- added a new patch:
  acpi/ghes: don't check if physical_address is not zero
- removed a duplicated le64_to_cpu();
- changed a comment about writing 1 to read ack register.

v4:
- merged a patch renaming the function which calculate offsets to:
  get_hw_error_offsets(), to avoid the need of such change at the next
  patch series;
- removed a functional change at the logic which makes
  the GHES record generation more generic;
- a couple of trivial changes on patch descriptions and line break cleanups.

v3:
- improved some patch descriptions;
- some patches got reordered to better reflect the changes;
- patch v2 08/15: acpi/ghes: Prepare to support multiple sources on ghes
  was split on two patches. The first one is in this cleanup series:
      acpi/ghes: Change ghes fill logic to work with only one source
  contains just the simplification logic. The actual preparation will
  be moved to this series:
     https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/cover.1727782588.git.mchehab+huawei@kernel.org/

v2: 
- some indentation fixes;
- some description improvements;
- fixed a badly-solved merge conflict that ended renaming a parameter.
