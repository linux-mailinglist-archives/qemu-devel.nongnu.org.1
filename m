I've already tried to say that in the previous reply but maybe I can 
explain it better here. I think keeping per target binaries would be 
desired so single binary would not replace it just become an additional 
option. For example when I want to play with old stuff I compile with 
--target-list=ppc-softmmu and don't want to wait compiling all the other 
targets I don't use and not even interested in PPC64. A distro may want to 
ship a single qemu-system binary instead but other distros may prefer per 
target packages not one huge package so users can decide which ones to 
install. All of these are valid use cases, therefore this single binary 
should be an additional option not the only true way from now on 
replacing existing per target builds.
