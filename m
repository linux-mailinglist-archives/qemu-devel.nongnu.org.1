I'm fairly confused what the intended difference is between
stuff in 'misc.json' and stuff in 'machine.json' already,
and just preserved that split rather than try to think about
it in more detail.

Adding SPDX-License-Identifier to existing files is something we're
not generally doing, only newly created files are getting it.

See also my comment in the commit message that this has different
behaviour on x86 vs non-x86, when no RTC is present - x86 treats
"no RTC" as a no-op, but non-x86 treats it as an error.

I don't mind if we preserve this inconsistency though.

That's what I started doing but I forgot that doesn't work out well
with the linker.

The linker's granularity for dropping stubs is per-file, not per-symbol.

If /any/ method in a stub/nnn.c file is needed, the linker will pull in
all methods. This results in duplicate symbol errors if only a subset
of stub methods were actually needed.

This forces us to have a separate stub file per build configuration
scenario that can affect use of stubs.

With regards,
Daniel
