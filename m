The scope of the DEV.FN hack is worse than that - with PCI addresses,
while most of the time we just pass DEV, the QAPI also accepts it in
DEV.FN format for the 'addr' property and libvirt relies on that.

Here are two example CLIs that libvirt would generate when configuring
multi-function PCI placement:

For PCI-E (q35)

  -device '{"driver":"pcie-root-port",
            "port":19,
            "chassis":16,
            "id":"pci.16",
            "bus":"pcie.0",
            "multifunction":true,
            "addr":"0x2.0x3"}'

For PCI (i440fx)

  -device '{"driver":"lsi",
            "id":"scsi2",
            "bus":"pci.0",
            "multifunction":true,
            "addr":"0x4.0x1"}'

With regards,
Daniel
