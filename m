I referred to both of finalize() and free() with "resource 
deallocation"; actually I referred to any resource that requires some 
operation after its use finishes.

Ideally, any resource should be automatically released. It should be 
also possible to manually release resource to enforce ordering.

We have full control when the scenario where the MR is automatically 
unparented so it is not really a problem. It is safe to automatically 
call memory_region_del_subregion() in such a case.

I am talking about side effects caused by automatically calling 
memory_region_del_subregion() when instance_finalize() of the owner 
calls object_unparent() for the subregion. This mutates the state of the 
container although object_unparent() is called for the subregion. This 
is a side effect a device does not expect.

So there is a tradeoff. There is no such side effect in my patch. My 
patch strictly keeps the direction of reference (a container refers to 
its subregion) so a subregion does not have to mutate the state of its 
container. However it makes use of the reference counter.

What you propose on the other hand does not use the reference counter, 
but it goes against the direction of reference and changes the state of 
container when the subregion gets unparented, which can be surprising 
for the device.

I argue that my patch makes the good tradeoff because the logic is so 
simple that it can be trivially adapted even if the reference counter 
gets removed. On the other hand, having a side effect when finalizing 
subregions makes an assumption on devices, and there are plenty of 
devices in QEMU. Comparing the numbers, it makes more sense to maintain 
one simple logic of reference tracking.
