Arm is a bigger problem as historically there genuinely was a
non-trivial set of CPUs with 32-on-64 support in HW.

IIUC, the riscv situation is much less likely to be a real problem

The other thing is that qemu-binfmt-conf.sh is not really the right
place to decide this, as we can't assume it is being run on the machine
that QEMU will be deployed on. eg in distro case, qemu-binfmt-conf.sh
may be run in a build farm to statically generate files.

Any conditional loading of binfmt rules would required extra magic to be
implemented by systemd, or would have to be done by the user selectively
installing different packages to omit the binfmt rules they don't want.

As a immediate bandaid, I'd suggest that qemu-binfmt-conf.sh could keep
its current logic as the default, and have a switch "--32-on-64" [1] to
tell it to generate the binfmt for 32-bit arch, even if 64-bit arch
could have 32-bit support.

Distros/users could then choose whether to pass --32-on-64 when statically
generating the binfmt files.

With regards,
Daniel
