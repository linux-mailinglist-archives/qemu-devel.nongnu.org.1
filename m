migration thread is fine, it takes a refcount at the entry.

And btw, taking it at the entry is racy, we've just fixed it, see (in my
next migration pull):

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20241024213056.1395400-2-peterx@redhat.com/

The access reported was, IIUC, outside migration code, but after both
main/migration threads released the refcount, hence after finalize().  It
could be a random migration_is_running() call very late in device code, for
example.

Yes.  But this show case series isn't complete.  We need a migration-side
lock finally to make it safe to access.  For that, see:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20241024213056.1395400-9-peterx@redhat.com/

I hope after the other series applied it will be 100% safe, even though I
agree it's tricky.  But hopefully QOM is very clean, the trickly part is
still within migration, and it should be less tricky than migration
implement a refcount on top of Object..

I think the question is whether things like migration_is_running() is
allowed to be used anywhere, even after migration_shutdown().  My answer
is, it should be ok to be used anywhere, and we don't necessarilly need to
limit that.  In that case the caller doesn't need to take a refcount
because it's an immediate query.  It can simply check its existance with
the lock (after my patch 8 of the other series applied, which depends on
this qom series).

Thanks,
