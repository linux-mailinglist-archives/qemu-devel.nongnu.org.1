Hi,

Thank you for the reply.

I would like to clarify one thing in the figure "Full two-entries descriptor
table". The driver can only overwrite a used descriptor in the descriptor
ring, right? And likewise for the device? So in the figure, the driver will
have to wait until descriptor[1] is used before it can overwrite it?

Suppose the device marks descriptor[0] as used. I think the driver will
not be able to overwrite that descriptor entry because it has to go in
order and is at descriptor[1]. Is that correct? Is it possible for the driver
to go "backwards" in the descriptor ring?

Understood. Thank you for the clarification.

I have some questions from the "Virtio live migration technical deep
dive" article [1].

Q1.
In the paragraph just above Figure 6, there is the following line:
> the vhost kernel thread and QEMU may run in different CPU threads,
> so these writes must be synchronized with QEMU cleaning of the dirty
> bitmap, and this write must be seen strictly after the modifications of
> the guest memory by the QEMU thread.

I am not clear on the last part of the statement. The modification of guest
memory is being done by the vhost device and not by the QEMU thread, right?

Q2.
In the first point of the "Dynamic device state: virtqueue state" section:
>The guest makes available N descriptors at the source of the migration,
>so its avail idx member in the avail idx is N.

I think there's a typo here: "...avail idx member in the avail ring is N"
instead of "...avail idx is N".

Regarding the implementation of this project, can the project be broken
down into two parts:
1. implementing packed virtqueues in QEMU, and
2. providing mechanisms for (live) migration to work with packed
    virtqueues.

I am ready to start working on the implementation. In one of your
previous emails you had talked about moving packed virtqueue
related implementation from the kernel's drivers/virtio/virtio_ring.c
into vhost_shadow_virtqueue.c.

My plan is to also understand how split virtqueue has been implemented
in QEMU. I think that'll be helpful when moving the kernel's implementation
to QEMU.

Please let me know if I should change my approach.

Thanks,
Sahil
