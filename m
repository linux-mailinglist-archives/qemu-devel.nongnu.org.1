Sure, yes. Sorry, I keep thinking of documentation as containing "any
number of sections" but keep eliding the fact that our parser
implementation currently will never actually create multiple adjacent
"untagged" sections.

I don't even change this anywhere even in my offline WIP, so it's just me
being over-general.

(I don't think it winds up being relevant or mattering to anything in this
series or my larger project beyond some word choices.)

I think you're referring to my desire to banish "untagged" sections from
appearing *between* "tagged" sections. Yes, that's still a desire; though I
make no movement on it in this series as sent to list, and this change is
entirely unrelated to that desire.

(It's more related to being able to distinguish features from members, and
later, distinguishing intro/details. This patch still serves a purpose even
without the inliner or the complexities it brings, but serves both needs.)

((Reminder: the reason for this desire is because "tagged sections" are
rendered in html as a two-column list, and free paragraphs appearing
between list entries looks bad in the rendered documentation, because it
means ending the table, starting paragraph(s), then starting a new table.
If free text is meant to be associated with a specific
member/feature/section-group, it should be marked up (in SOME way) so that
the renderer can achieve that grouping visually.

(There will be a standalone patch that implements this restriction and we
can debate this there, I'm only giving you context here.)))

Note that this patch changes this as well; it becomes "member" or "feature"
as appropriate and the name is moved into a dedicated name field that
belongs to the ArgSection class.

(Turns out legacy qapidoc doesn't use this stored name at all anyway, it
fetches the name via the linked feature/member instead.)

What suits me is "member" and "feature". :)

For static typing reasons, an explicit tag is preferred to distinguish from
it being "optional".

I could cope with any of:

"plain",
"text",
"plaintext",
"paragraphs",
"unstructured",
"free"

... keeping in mind that I do intend to "split" this tag/kind into "intro"
and "details" later. i.e. this is a temporary tag/kind label.

I think I like "text" the most because it says the least. What about you?

I believe they can be removed entirely once the old qapidoc is sunset,
leaving only .sections[] behind.

This removes the temptation to pick out sections "out of order".

We only need the list of sections in their source order to generate the
appropriate rST.

(Note: the inliner actually does need to filter sections somewhat to do its
inlining magic, but we'll talk about that later. All you need to know right
now is that my WIP does not utilize any field except .sections[], so the
others can in fact be dropped as redundant once we make the switch. This
patch helps enable the paradigm of "everything you need to render a section
is contained within the Section object itself" which lends itself well to
the new transmogrifier, the goal of always processing/rendering in source
order, and facilitating the mechanics of the inliner.)

...

In case I got too rambly, my action items for this patch are:

- fix the test (already done)
- rename tag to kind
- rename "untagged" to "text", possibly changing it again pending your
feedback.

Then we may have a &quot;Features:&quot; line followed by feature descripti=
ons.<br>
<br>
Finally, we may have any number of tagged or untagged sections.<br>
<br>
Each of these sections is represented as an instance of type Section,<br>
and the entire definition doc as an instance of type QAPIDoc.<br>
<br>
Section has a member @tag of type str.<br>
<br>
For tagged sections, it&#39;s the tag, i.e &quot;Since&quot;, &quot;Returns=
&quot;, ...=C2=A0 Obvious<br>
enough.<br>
<br>
For overview and other untagged sections, it&#39;s None.=C2=A0 Still obviou=

For descriptions, it&#39;s the name of the thing being described.=C2=A0 Les=

 a<br>
subtype of Section, which prevents confusion with tagged sections.<br></blo=
