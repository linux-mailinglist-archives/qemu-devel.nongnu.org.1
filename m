it would not be fair to ask you or Bernard to deal with every
case where ISAPC related code gets in a way, nor it's fair to
ask other contributors to ensure that their patches don't break
semi-working ISAPC or refactor code that relates to it.=20

[
for example I'd like to refactor smbios parts in the image
ACPI table builder, but the I'd have to do it for legacy
part as well without means to verify that. Sure it can be
done but at cost of extra time spent to rewrite something
that would never be used and to find test env to verify
touched code.
]

However I look at it, isapc is burden at this point=20
and it gets into a way of evolving.

[downstream hat]
while both of you do a wonderful job of separating some parts
of the mess we have, it's a lot of churn which is not ideal when it
comes to backporting patches.

[emotional hat]
Nowadays with modern containers tooling it's very easy to
spawn old qemu environment to play with removed machines/features.
quick few minutes example that lets me run isapc on old ubuntu
without need to read how to build containers in 100 different ways:

 toolbox create --distro ubuntu --release 22.04
 toolbox enter ubuntu-toolbox-22.04
 toolbox enter ubuntu-toolbox-22.04
[user@toolbox ~]$ sudo apt update
[user@toolbox ~]$ sudo apt install qemu-system-x86
[user@toolbox ~]$ qemu-system-i386 -M isapc -vnc :0 my_toy.qcow2


PS:
I haven't had high hopes of this getting accepted,
but I had to try.
Though recent trend was that upstream
QEMU were deprecating/dropping old machines/devices
(even ones that kernel folks were using for testing)
and it hasn't caused the end of universe (old qemu(s)
sill exists and can be used for those cases).=20
