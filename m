docs/devel/secure-coding-practices.rst says "Unexpected accesses must 
not cause memory corruption or leaks in QEMU".

I'm not completely sure whether it is safe without concurrent accesses 
either. In particular, KVM does not immediately update the guest memory 
mapping, so it may result in a time window where the guest memory is 
mapped to an unmapped host memory region, and I suspect that could cause 
a problem. That also motivates limiting the scope of the change to TCG.

This patch bypasses RCU. That's why it solves the hang even though the 
RCU itself is not fixed.

Let me summarize the theory and the actual behavior below:

The theory is that RCU satisfies the common requirement of concurrent 
algorithms. More concretely:
1) It is race-free; for RCU, it means it prevents use-after-free.
2) It does not prevent forward progress.

The patch message suggests 2) is not satisfied. A proper fix would be to 
change RCU to satisfy 2).

However, this patch workarounds the problem by circumventing RCU, which 
solves 2) but it regresses 1).

My suggestion is to document and to limit the impact of 1) by:
a) Limiting the scope of the change to TCG.
b) Not freeing memory regions, which will prevent use-after-free while 
leaking memory.

Manos said b) can be problematic because mappings are frequently 
created. Whether b) makes sense or not depends on the probability and 
impact of UAF and memory leak.

Akihiko Odaki
