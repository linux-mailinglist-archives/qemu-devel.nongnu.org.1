Hi!=0A=0AI'm the author of Vitastor SDS (https://vitastor.io/). My projec=
t is an opensource SDS with an architecture similar to Ceph, but simpler =
and faster - in the terms of latency, it's ~10x faster, it easily reaches=
 0.1ms T1Q1 latency with NVMe disks.=0A=0AI have a custom block driver fo=
r qemu (block/vitastor.c), currently I package it manually and provide my=
 own QEMU packages.=0A=0AI wanted to ask if I can submit this driver to y=
ou to package it upstream? It requires libvitastor_client library to buil=
d which is also currently available either in source form or from my repo=
sitories, is it fine?=0A=0AAnd actually, if that's a problem, another opt=
ion for me would be to use a hypothetical QAPI plugin system if QEMU had =
one - because, in fact, the only thing which is forcing me to rebuild QEM=
U is qapi/block-core.json. I have to patch it because, otherwise, the JSO=
N options of my block driver aren't accepted by QEMU. So if there was a w=
ay to dynamically load these qapi definitions it would allow me to make c=
ompatible *.so block driver builds easily, even though there's no "stable=
" API as I understand. I'd just need a separate build for every qemu vers=
ion, but that's not a problem for me :-). Or maybe such thing already exi=
sts and I just miss it?=0A=0AWhat do you think?=0A=0A-- =0AThanks in adva=
nce,=0A  Vitaliy Filippov
