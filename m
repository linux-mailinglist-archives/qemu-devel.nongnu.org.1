Sigh, what we obviously need here, is what we've always talked about as our
long term design goal:

A way to launch QEMU with the CLI only specifying the QMP socket, and every
other config aspect done by issuing QMP commands, which are processed in the
order the mgmt app sends them, so QEMU hasn't have to hardcode processing
of different pieces in different phases.

Anything that isn't that, is piling more hacks on top of our existing
mountain of hacks. That's OK if it does something useful as a side effect
that moves us incrementally closer towards that desired end goal.

Is CPR still going to useful enough in the real world if you drop chardev
support ? Every VM has at least one chardev for a serial device doesn't
it, and often more since we wire chardevs into all kinds of places.
