If it reflects maintainer status, then we're obvioulsy overlapping
with the MAINTAINERS file info, but "UNSAFE" suggests something
different....

So what I think would be valuable is marking whether a device is
considered to provide a guest security boundary.  This would in turn
indicate whether we would treat flaws in its impl as being worthy of
triaging as CVEs, or merely be normal bugs.

We already document in security.rst that we consider virtualization
use cases only to provide a security boundary, but on every bug report
we have to decide whether the device in question is considered relevant
to a "virtualization"  use case.

This was a known limitation, because we had no metadata to track
which devices were considered "secure". It was always expected that
long term we should be tagging devices/machines/accelerators/etc
with their security status.

It would be nice from an end user POV to be able to have a way to tell
QEMU to enforce that a given VM provides a guest security boundary, and
get a hard error at startup, or hot-plug if any device cannot satisfy
that requirement.

I think (3) is pretty hard to define, as "better" is very much a
use case specific decision. You could say that everything, for
which a virtio device exists, has a "better" alternative. That's
only true if running a modern OS though. If running a vintage
OS, the "outdated" thing is liley "better".

Even that has the same problem as (3) - the recommended devices
differ depending on what OS you're intending to use.

This problem is pretty much why libosinfo exists to provide more
guided hardware recommendations tailored to OS.
