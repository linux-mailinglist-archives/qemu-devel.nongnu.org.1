The upside with checking in every historical schema is that we
have a set of self-contained schemas where you can see everything
at a glance for each version.

The downside with checking in every historical schema is that between
any adjacent pair of schemas 99% of the content is identical. IOW we
are very wasteful of storage.

Looking at your other mail about schema diffs, I wonder if we the
diff format you show there can kill two birds with one stone.

  https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-06/msg02398.html

In my reply I had illustrated a variant of your format:

 - x-query-rdma
 -     returns.human-readable-text: str
 . blockdev-backup
 +     arguments.discard-source: Optional<boolean>
 . migrate
 -    arguments.blk: Optional<boolean>
 -    arguments.inc: Optional<boolean>
 . object-add
 .    arguments.qom-type: enum
 +        'sev-snp-guest'
 +    arguments[sev-guest].legacy-vm-type: Optional<boolean>
 +    arguments[sev-snp-guest].author-key-enabled: Optional<boolean>
 +    arguments[sev-snp-guest].cbitpos: Optional<integer>


Where '.' is just pre-existing context, and +/- have the obvious
meaning for the 2 given versions.

What if, we append a version number to *every* line, and exclusively
use +/-.

Taking just one small command:

 + 6.2.0: x-query-rdma
 + 6.2.0:    returns.human-readable-text: str
 - 9.1.0: x-query-rdma

This tell us 'x-query-rdma' was added in 6.2.0, the
'human-readable-text' parameter arrived at the same
time, and the whole command was then deleted in 9.1.0
That has implicit property deletion, but for completeness
we could be explicit about each property when deleting
a command:

 + 6.2.0: x-query-rdma
 + 6.2.0:    returns.human-readable-text: str
 - 9.1.0:    returns.human-readable-text: str
 - 9.1.0: x-query-rdma

Taking the more complex 'object-add' command

 +  2.0.0: object-add
 +  2.0.0:   arguments.qom-type: enum
 +  2.0.0:     '....'
 + 2.11.0:     'sev-guest'
 +  9.1.0:     'sev-snp-guest'
 + 2.11.0:   arguments[sev-guest].policy: uint32
 + 2.11.0:   arguments[sev-guest].session-file: str
 + 2.11.0:   arguments[sev-guest].dh-cert: str
 +  9.1.0:   arguments[sev-guest].legacy-vm-type: Optional<boolean>
 +  9.1.0:   arguments[sev-snp-guest].author-key-enabled: Optional<boolean>
 +  9.1.0:   arguments[sev-snp-guest].cbitpos: Optional<integer>


IOW, object-add was introduced in 2.0.0. The 'sev-guest' enum
variant was added in 2.11.0 with various fields at the same
time. The 'sev-guest' enum variant got an exctra field in 9.1.0
The 'sev-snp-guest' enum variant was added in 9.1.0 with some
fields.


For fields which change from Optional <-> Required, that could
be modelled simply as parameter deletion + addition in the
same version eg hypothetically lets say the 'sev-guest' field
'policy' had changed, we would see:

 +  2.0.0: object-add
 +  2.0.0:   arguments.qom-type: enum
 +  2.0.0:     '....'
 + 2.11.0:     'sev-guest'
 +  9.1.0:     'sev-snp-guest'
 + 2.11.0:   arguments[sev-guest].policy: uint32
 -  6.2.0:   arguments[sev-guest].policy: uint32
 +  6.2.0:   arguments[sev-guest].policy: Optional<uint32>
 + 2.11.0:   arguments[sev-guest].session-file: str
 + 2.11.0:   arguments[sev-guest].dh-cert: str
 +  9.1.0:   arguments[sev-guest].legacy-vm-type: Optional<boolean>
 +  9.1.0:   arguments[sev-snp-guest].author-key-enabled: Optional<boolean>
 +  9.1.0:   arguments[sev-snp-guest].cbitpos: Optional<integer>


Incidentally, if going down this route, I think I would NOT
have 1 file with the whole schema history, but have 1 file
per command / event. eg qapi/history/object-add.txt,
qapi/history/x-query-rdma.txt, qapi/history/VFIO_MIGRATION.txt,
etc. This will make it trivial for a person to focus in on
changes in the command they care about, likely without even
needing a schema diff tool much of the time, as the per-command
files will often be concise enough you can consider the full
history without filtering.

With a single file containing all deltas, where each line is
version annotated, the "diff" tool becomes little more than
something which can 'grep' for lines in the file which have
a version number within the desired range. In fact it can also
optionally offer something better than a diff, as instead of
showing you only the orignal state and result state, it
can trivially shows you any intermediate changes and what
version they happened with. 

eg if you asked for a diff between 2.0.0 and 9.1.0, and there
was a command or property that was added in 4.0.0 and deleted
in 6.0.0, a traditional diff will not tell you about this. You'll
never notice it ever existed. 

A "history grep" showing the set of changes between 2 versions
will highlight things that come + go, which can be quite
useful for understanding API evolution I think.

Daniel
