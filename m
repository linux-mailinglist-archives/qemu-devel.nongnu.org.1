But do functions that return negative errno together with errp, with
callers that use this errno exit? I don't ask to find, that's not simple.
I just say, that I myself don't know any of such functions.


upd: I found two!

how:

1. git grep -A 20 'ret = .*errp)'
2. in opened pager, do `/if \(ret == -E`


in iommufd_cdev_autodomains_get() we do something just wrong: we clear errp
after iommufd_cdev_attach_ioas_hwpt(), but return false, which is treated
as error (but with cleared errp!) by callers...


in qemu_read_default_config_file() we do correct thing, but keeping in mind,
that it's very seldom practice (around one case), we'd better add a boolean
parameter to qemu_read_config_file(), and parse errno exactly after call to
fopen().


trying with local_err gives a bit more:

git grep -A 20 'ret = .*&\(local_\)\?err)' | grep 'ret == -E'
block.c-    if (ret == -ENOTSUP) {
block.c-    if (ret == -EFBIG) {
block/snapshot.c-    if (ret == -ENOENT || ret == -EINVAL) {
hw/core/loader-fit.c-    if (ret == -ENOENT) {
hw/scsi/megasas.c-        assert(!ret || ret == -ENOTSUP);
hw/scsi/mptsas.c-        assert(!ret || ret == -ENOTSUP);
hw/usb/hcd-xhci-pci.c-        assert(!ret || ret == -ENOTSUP);
hw/vfio/pci.c-        if (ret == -ENOTSUP) {
nbd/server.c-    } while (ret == -EAGAIN && !client->quiescing);
nbd/server.c-    if (ret == -EAGAIN) {
nbd/server.c-    if (ret == -EIO) {
qemu-img.c-        if (ret == -ENOTSUP) {


I still think, that these are very seldom cases, some of them are just wrong,
some make sense, but their contract may be simplified.

Agree.

I just want to say, that usual pattern

int func1(..., Error *errp) {
     ...
     ret = func2(..., Error *errp);
     if (ret < 0) {
         return ret;
     }
     ...
}

is very error-prone, if func1 has some unwritten contract about _different_
errno values. As this unwritten contract may be easily broken somewhere
in the stack, not exactly in func1.
