It is currently reserved bit in AMD's manual. But it doesn't mean it 
will be reserved forever. Nothing prevents AMD to implement it in the 
future.

Software shouldn't set any expectation on the reserved bit.

As I said, it's just the workaround for users who want to run a specific 
version of Windows with "-cpu host" on AMD. That's why it's called 
workaround.

The root-cause is the wrong behavior of the specific version of Windows. 
If you don't use the buggy Windows, you don't need the workaround.
