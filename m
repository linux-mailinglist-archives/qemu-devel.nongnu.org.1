Yes. If a type is only ever used as a branch type or a base type and never
named as a field type, it can be safely omitted from the rendered docs.

(If a type is not named in any fashion by and command or event or recursive
structure therein, it's an internal type not used in QMP at all and can
also be excluded safely.)

What I mean to say is that anywhere in the generated documentation where we
need to cross-reference a type name should be "doc visible".

This means, currently:

- All commands
- All events
- All member field types (including branch field types) of commands/events
or nested fields therein (i.e. CommandA takes an arg "foo" of type "FooA"
which in turn has a field "bar" of type "BarB"; CommandA, FooA and BarB are
all doc visible types.)
- All return types and nested types therein; identical to the input rules
above (You've expressed a desire to change this. Future work.)
- All alternate types (which are never inlined but instead are referenced.
This can be changed later but it's just not how it works currently.)

but excludes:

- Arg types for events/commands
- Inherited object types
- Any data type that does not appear as a field/member type for a
command/event input/output
- Array/List types: only the primitive types are documented with a section,
not the List/Array container. This is in contrast to Alternates, where we
do not perform a similar destructuring.

So, if you look at the WIP render on gitlab.io, any (type) parenthetical
links to a "qapi object" (Sphinx parlance: an indexable qapi domain
*thingie*) that exists as its own section with a name and docs attached.

Those are the ones that are "doc visible".

This differs from introspection in that some (but not all) of the shared
types get sections in the HTML output, but these are not API and not
inherently stable with regards to their name(s) or factorings.

Introspection by contrast strips more of the names out than we do here.

Not quite; in the generator, we visit only entities that *have docs*, so
the true visibility check is (pseudocode):

ent.doc_visible() && ent.has_docs()

but we guarantee this does not cull anything inappropriate because any
hanging reference is a warning that will cause a build failure. This should
not be possible to trigger in the doc builder under normal circumstances.

I just mean to say: "I believe the algorithm in this patch is correct
because the build would not tolerate a hanging reference, and the doc
generator does in fact succeed."

Notably, the doc_visible algorithm may mark some built-in types as
"visible", but they're still excluded from the html render because they
simply have no docs to show. (The reference checker will not yelp for these
built-in types.)
