Hello, thank you for taking the time to review the patch,
and tell us what we could improve.

Hm, I'll make those changes (hopefully) by Wednesday next week.
I'm a bit busy, so it might take a bit of time to do it.

I'll try reading through the relevant sections and send an
updated patch later next week. From what I can tell it falls
under the bcm2835_pheripherals.c file, right?
