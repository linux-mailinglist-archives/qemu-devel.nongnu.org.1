I don't know about shutdown(), but close() certainly works. If shutdown()
is not sufficient, then IMHO the migration code would need the ability to
use close() to deal with this situation.

Sufficient migration QMP commands should exist to ensure migration can
always be cancelled. Short keepalive timeouts should not be considered
a solution to any gaps in that respect.

Also there is yank, but IMHO apps shouldn't have to rely on yank - I see
yank as a safety net for apps to workaround limitations in QEMU.
