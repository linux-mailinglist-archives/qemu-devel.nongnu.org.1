OK, good. Anyway, after sleeping on it, I decided to not focus at
the query for now, as my goal is to validate Linux Kernel and 
rasdaemon. So, I'll just fill them when calling the error inject
script.

As a reference, for ARM Processor error injection, there are just 4
fields that would benefit for a query to fill the default values:

	- mpidr-el1
	- midr-el1
	- power_state
	- ARM context registers and its type

I see.

Yes, I'll maintain it.

That's good.

Ok, I'll be submitting a v4 using the CPER raw data plus script approach.
I'll be placing the script at the final patch.

I opted to make the simplest possible QAPI (keeping it marked as unstable),
as we might need/want to improve it to support other features.

Btw, as error injection is not trivial, and using the script is the best
way to do it, I would prefer to keep such QAPI always marked as unstable,
as it is preferred that QEMU users to use it (and submit patches improving
it) instead of manually crafting CPER records with their own scripts.

Thanks,
Mauro
