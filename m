<br>
<br>
<br>
Changes from V15 to V16<br>
<br>
- Fixed resource_get_info() change made in v15 that was squshed into a<br>
=C2=A0 wrong patch. Squashed set_scanout_blob patch into the blob-commands =
patch,<br>
=C2=A0 otherwise we&#39;ll need to revert back ordering of blob patches to =
older v7<br>
=C2=A0 variant.<br>
<br>
- Changed hostmem mapping state to boolean, suggested by Akihiko Odaki.<br>
<br>
- Documented Venus in virtio-gpu doc. Amended &quot;Support Venus context&q=
uot; patch<br>
=C2=A0 with the doc addition. Suggested by Akihiko Odaki.<br>
<br>
Changes from V14 to V15<br>
<br>
- Dropped hostmem mapping state that got unused in v14, suggested by<br>
=C2=A0 Akihiko Odaki.<br>
<br>
- Moved resource_get_info() from set_scanout_blob() to create_blob(),<br>
=C2=A0 suggested by Akihiko Odaki.<br>
<br>
- Fixed unitilized variable in create_blob(), spotted by Alex Benn=C3=A9e.<=
br>
<br>
Changes from V13 to V14<br>
<br>
- Fixed erronous fall-through in renderer_state&#39;s switch-case that was<=
br>
=C2=A0 spotted by Marc-Andr=C3=A9 Lureau.<br>
<br>
- Reworked HOSTMEM_MR_FINISH_UNMAPPING handling as was suggested by<br>
=C2=A0 Akihiko Odaki. Now it shares the same code path with HOSTMEM_MR_MAPP=
ED.<br>
<br>
- Made use of g_autofree in virgl_cmd_resource_create_blob() as was<br>
=C2=A0 suggested by Akihiko Odaki.<br>
<br>
- Removed virtio_gpu_virgl_deinit() and moved all deinit code to<br>
=C2=A0 virtio_gpu_gl_device_unrealize() as was suggested by Marc-Andr=C3=A9=
 Lureau.<br>
<br>
- Replaced HAVE_FEATURE in mseon.build with virglrenderer&#39;s VERSION_MAJ=
OR<br>
=C2=A0 check as was suggested by Marc-Andr=C3=A9 Lureau.<br>
<br>
- Added trace event for cmd-suspension as was suggested by Marc-Andr=C3=A9 =
Lureau.<br>
<br>
- Added patch to replace in-flight printf&#39;s with trace events as was<br=
>
=C2=A0 suggested by Marc-Andr=C3=A9 Lureau<br>
<br>
Changes from V12 to V13<br>
<br>
- Replaced `res-&gt;async_unmap_in_progress` flag with a mapping state,<br>
=C2=A0 moved it to the virtio_gpu_virgl_hostmem_region like was suggested<b=
r>
=C2=A0 by Akihiko Odaki.<br>
<br>
- Renamed blob_unmap function and added back cmd_suspended argument<br>
=C2=A0 to it. Suggested by Akihiko Odaki.<br>
<br>
- Reordered VirtIOGPUGL refactoring patches to minimize code changes<br>
=C2=A0 like was suggested by Akihiko Odaki.<br>
<br>
- Replaced gl-&gt;renderer_inited with gl-&gt;renderer_state, like was sugg=
ested<br>
=C2=A0 by Alex Benn=C3=A9e.<br>
<br>
- Added gl-&gt;renderer state resetting to gl_device_unrealize(), for<br>
=C2=A0 consistency. Suggested by Alex Benn=C3=A9e.<br>
<br>
- Added rb&#39;s from Alex and Manos.<br>
<br>
- Fixed compiling with !HAVE_VIRGL_RESOURCE_BLOB.<br>
<br>
Changes from V11 to V12<br>
<br>
- Fixed virgl_cmd_resource_create_blob() error handling. Now it doesn&#39;t=
<br>
=C2=A0 corrupt resource list and releases resource properly on error. Thank=
s<br>
=C2=A0 to Akihiko Odaki for spotting the bug.<br>
<br>
- Added new patch that handles virtio_gpu_virgl_init() failure gracefully,<=
br>
=C2=A0 fixing Qemu crash. Besides fixing the crash, it allows to implement<=
br>
=C2=A0 a cleaner virtio_gpu_virgl_deinit().<br>
<br>
- virtio_gpu_virgl_deinit() now assumes that previously virgl was<br>
=C2=A0 initialized successfully when it was inited at all. Suggested by<br>
=C2=A0 Akihiko Odaki.<br>
<br>
- Fixed missed freeing of print_stats timer in virtio_gpu_virgl_deinit()<br=
>
<br>
- Added back blob unmapping or RESOURCE_UNREF that was requested<br>
=C2=A0 by Akihiko Odaki. Added comment to the code explaining how<br>
=C2=A0 async unmapping works. Added back `res-&gt;async_unmap_in_progress`<=
br>
=C2=A0 flag and added comment telling why it&#39;s needed.<br>
<br>
- Moved cmdq_resume_bh to VirtIOGPUGL and made coding style changes<br>
=C2=A0 suggested by Akihiko Odaki.<br>
<br>
- Added patches that move fence_poll and print_stats timers to VirtIOGPUGL<=
br>
=C2=A0 for consistency with cmdq_resume_bh.<br>
<br>
Changes from V10 to V11<br>
<br>
- Replaced cmd_resume bool in struct ctrl_command with<br>
=C2=A0 &quot;cmd-&gt;finished + !VIRTIO_GPU_FLAG_FENCE&quot; checking as wa=
s requested<br>
=C2=A0 by Akihiko Odaki.<br>
<br>
- Reworked virgl_cmd_resource_unmap/unref_blob() to avoid re-adding<br>
=C2=A0 the &#39;async_unmap_in_progress&#39; flag that was dropped in v9:<b=
r>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 1. virgl_cmd_resource_[un]map_blob() now doesn&#39;t check it=

<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 2. error returned by virgl_renderer_resource_unmap() is now h=
andled<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0and reported properly, previously the error wasn=
&#39;t checked. The<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0virgl_renderer_resource_unmap() fails if resourc=

<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 3. virgl_cmd_resource_unref_blob() now doesn&#39;t allow to u=
nref resource<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0that is mapped, it&#39;s a error condition if gu=
est didn&#39;t unmap resource<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0before doing the unref. Previously unref was imp=
licitly unmapping<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0resource.<br>
<br>
Changes from V9 to V10<br>
<br>
- Dropped &#39;async_unmap_in_progress&#39; variable and switched to use<br=
>
=C2=A0 aio_bh_new() isntead of oneshot variant in the &quot;blob commands&q=
uot; patch.<br>
<br>
- Further improved error messages by printing error code when actual error<=
br>
=C2=A0 occurrs and using ERR_UNSPEC instead of ERR_ENOMEM when we don&#39;t=
 really<br>
=C2=A0 know if it was ENOMEM for sure.<br>
<br>
- Added vdc-&gt;unrealize for the virtio GL device and freed virgl data.<br=
>
<br>
- Dropped UUID and doc/migration patches. UUID feature isn&#39;t needed<br>
=C2=A0 anymore, instead we changed Mesa Venus driver to not require UUID.<b=
r>
<br>
- Renamed virtio-gpu-gl &quot;vulkan&quot; property name back to &quot;venu=
s&quot;.<br>
<br>
Changes from V8 to V9<br>
<br>
- Added resuming of cmdq processing when hostmem MR is freed,<br>
=C2=A0 as was suggested by Akihiko Odaki.<br>
<br>
- Added more error messages, suggested by Akihiko Odaki<br>
<br>
- Dropped superfluous &#39;res-&gt;async_unmap_completed&#39;, suggested<br=
>
=C2=A0 by Akihiko Odaki.<br>
<br>
- Kept using cmd-&gt;suspended flag. Akihiko Odaki suggested to make<br>
=C2=A0 virtio_gpu_virgl_process_cmd() return false if cmd processing is<br>
=C2=A0 suspended, but it&#39;s not easy to implement due to ubiquitous<br>
=C2=A0 VIRTIO_GPU_FILL_CMD() macros that returns void, requiring to change<=
br>
=C2=A0 all the virtio-gpu processing code.<br>
<br>
- Added back virtio_gpu_virgl_resource as was requested by Akihiko Odaki,<b=
r>
=C2=A0 though I&#39;m not convinced it&#39;s really needed.<br>
<br>
- Switched to use GArray, renamed capset2_max_ver/size vars and moved<br>
=C2=A0 &quot;vulkan&quot; property definition to the virtio-gpu-gl device i=
n the Venus<br>
=C2=A0 patch, like was suggested by Akihiko Odaki.<br>
<br>
- Moved UUID to virtio_gpu_virgl_resource and dropped UUID save/restore<br>
=C2=A0 since it will require bumping VM version and virgl device isn&#39;t =
miratable<br>
=C2=A0 anyways.<br>
<br>
- Fixed exposing UUID feature with Rutabaga<br>
<br>
- Dropped linux-headers update patch because headers were already updated<b=
r>
=C2=A0 in Qemu/staging.<br>
<br>
- Added patch that updates virtio migration doc with a note about virtio-gp=
u<br>
=C2=A0 migration specifics, suggested by Akihiko Odaki.<br>
<br>
- Addressed coding style issue noticed by Akihiko Odaki<br>
<br>
Changes from V7 to V8<br>
<br>
- Supported suspension of virtio-gpu commands processing and made<br>
=C2=A0 unmapping of hostmem region asynchronous by blocking/suspending<br>
=C2=A0 cmd processing until region is unmapped. Suggested by Akihiko Odaki.=
<br>
<br>
- Fixed arm64 building of x86 targets using updated linux-headers.<br>
=C2=A0 Corrected the update script. Thanks to Rob Clark for reporting<br>
=C2=A0 the issue.<br>
<br>
- Added new patch that makes registration of virgl capsets dynamic.<br>
=C2=A0 Requested by Antonio Caggiano and Pierre-Eric Pelloux-Prayer.<br>
<br>
- Venus capset now isn&#39;t advertised if Vulkan is disabled with vulkan=
=3Dfalse<br>
<br>
Changes from V6 to V7<br>
<br>
- Used scripts/update-linux-headers.sh to update Qemu headers based<br>
=C2=A0 on Linux v6.8-rc3 that adds Venus capset definition to virtio-gpu<br=
>
=C2=A0 protocol, was requested by Peter Maydel<br>
<br>
- Added r-bs that were given to v6 patches. Corrected missing s-o-bs<br>
<br>
- Dropped context_init Qemu&#39;s virtio-gpu device configuration flag,<br>
=C2=A0 was suggested by Marc-Andr=C3=A9 Lureau<br>
<br>
- Added missing error condition checks spotted by Marc-Andr=C3=A9 Lureau<br=
>
=C2=A0 and Akihiko Odaki, and few more<br>
<br>
- Returned back res-&gt;mr referencing to memory_region_init_ram_ptr() like=
<br>
=C2=A0 was suggested by Akihiko Odaki. Incorporated fix suggested by Pierre=
-Eric<br>
=C2=A0 to specify the MR name<br>
<br>
- Dropped the virgl_gpu_resource wrapper, cleaned up and simplified<br>
=C2=A0 patch that adds blob-cmd support<br>
<br>
- Fixed improper blob resource removal from resource list on resource_unref=
<br>
=C2=A0 that was spotted by Akihiko Odaki<br>
<br>
- Change order of the blob patches, was suggested by Akihiko Odaki.<br>
=C2=A0 The cmd_set_scanout_blob support is enabled first<br>
<br>
- Factored out patch that adds resource management support to virtio-gpu-gl=
,<br>
=C2=A0 was requested by Marc-Andr=C3=A9 Lureau<br>
<br>
- Simplified and improved the UUID support patch, dropped the hash table<br=
>
=C2=A0 as we don&#39;t need it for now. Moved QemuUUID to virtio_gpu_simple=
_resource.<br>
=C2=A0 This all was suggested by Akihiko Odaki and Marc-Andr=C3=A9 Lureau<b=
r>
<br>
- Dropped console_has_gl() check, suggested by Akihiko Odaki<br>
<br>
- Reworked Meson cheking of libvirglrender features, made new features<br>
=C2=A0 available based on virglrender pkgconfig version instead of checking=
<br>
=C2=A0 symbols in header. This should fix build error using older virglrend=
er<br>
=C2=A0 version, reported by Alex Benn=C3=A9e<br>
<br>
- Made enabling of Venus context configrable via new virtio-gpu device<br>
=C2=A0 &quot;vulkan=3Dtrue&quot; flag, suggested by Marc-Andr=C3=A9 Lureau.=
 The flag is disabled<br>
=C2=A0 by default because it requires blob and hostmem options to be enable=
d<br>
=C2=A0 and configured<br>
<br>
Changes from V5 to V6<br>
<br>
- Move macros configurations under virgl.found() and rename<br>
=C2=A0 HAVE_VIRGL_CONTEXT_CREATE_WITH_FLAGS.<br>
<br>
- Handle the case while context_init is disabled.<br>
<br>
- Enable context_init by default.<br>
<br>
- Move virtio_gpu_virgl_resource_unmap() into<br>
=C2=A0 virgl_cmd_resource_unmap_blob().<br>
<br>
- Introduce new struct virgl_gpu_resource to store virgl specific members.<=
br>
<br>
- Remove erro handling of g_new0, because glib will abort() on OOM.<br>
<br>
- Set resource uuid as option.<br>
<br>
- Implement optional subsection of vmstate_virtio_gpu_resource_uuid_state<b=
r>
=C2=A0 for virtio live migration.<br>
<br>
- Use g_int_hash/g_int_equal instead of the default<br>
<br>
- Add scanout_blob function for virtio-gpu-virgl<br>
<br>
- Resolve the memory leak on virtio-gpu-virgl<br>
<br>
- Remove the unstable API flags check because virglrenderer is already 1.0<=
br>
<br>
- Squash the render server flag support into &quot;Initialize Venus&quot;<b=
r>
<br>
Changes from V4 (virtio gpu V4) to V5<br>
<br>
- Inverted patch 5 and 6 because we should configure<br>
=C2=A0 HAVE_VIRGL_CONTEXT_INIT firstly.<br>
<br>
- Validate owner of memory region to avoid slowing down DMA.<br>
<br>
- Use memory_region_init_ram_ptr() instead of<br>
=C2=A0 memory_region_init_ram_device_ptr().<br>
<br>
- Adjust sequence to allocate gpu resource before virglrender resource<br>
=C2=A0 creation<br>
<br>
- Add virtio migration handling for uuid.<br>
<br>
- Send kernel patch to define VIRTIO_GPU_CAPSET_VENUS.<br>
=C2=A0 <a href=3D"https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20230915105918.3763061-1-ray=
.huang@amd.com/" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://lore.kernel.o=
rg/lkml/20230915105918.3763061-1-ray.huang@amd.com/</a><br>
<br>
- Add meson check to make sure unstable APIs defined from 0.9.0.<br>
<br>
Changes from V1 to V2 (virtio gpu V4)<br>
<br>
- Remove unused #include &quot;hw/virtio/virtio-iommu.h&quot;<br>
<br>
- Add a local function, called virgl_resource_destroy(), that is used<br>
=C2=A0 to release a vgpu resource on error paths and in resource_unref.<br>
<br>
- Remove virtio_gpu_virgl_resource_unmap from<br>
=C2=A0 virtio_gpu_cleanup_mapping(),<br>
=C2=A0 since this function won&#39;t be called on blob resources and also b=
ecause<br>
=C2=A0 blob resources are unmapped via virgl_cmd_resource_unmap_blob().<br>
<br>
- In virgl_cmd_resource_create_blob(), do proper cleanup in error paths<br>
=C2=A0 and move QTAILQ_INSERT_HEAD(&amp;g-&gt;reslist, res, next) after the=
 resource<br>
=C2=A0 has been fully initialized.<br>
<br>
- Memory region has a different life-cycle from virtio gpu resources<br>
=C2=A0 i.e. cannot be released synchronously along with the vgpu resource.<=
br>
=C2=A0 So, here the field &quot;region&quot; was changed to a pointer and i=
s allocated<br>
=C2=A0 dynamically when the blob is mapped.<br>
=C2=A0 Also, since the pointer can be used to indicate whether the blob<br>
=C2=A0 is mapped, the explicite field &quot;mapped&quot; was removed.<br>
<br>
- In virgl_cmd_resource_map_blob(), add check on the value of<br>
=C2=A0 res-&gt;region, to prevent beeing called twice on the same resource.=
<br>
<br>
- Add a patch to enable automatic deallocation of memory regions to resolve=
<br>
=C2=A0 use-after-free memory corruption with a reference.<br>
