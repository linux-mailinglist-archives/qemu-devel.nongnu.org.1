I'll split the VFIO patch out since I found patch "qdev: Automatically 
delete memory subregions" is unnecessary; I'll describe that later.

There is no functionally "broken" device. The patch that does fix 
something is the VFIO patch, and it fixes use-after-finalization, which 
is semantically problematic but does not cause a functional problem 
(like use-after-free).

If the container and the subregion shares the same owner, 
memory_region_del_subregion() is unnecessary in the first place and can 
be removed even without patch 2, and it seems there are a number of such 
unnecessary memory_region_del_subregion() calls.

That said, there are cases where memory_region_del_subregion() is truly 
needed. In general, a device exposes its MMIO functionality to the guest 
by adding its memory region to external containers, so there should be 
some containers and subregions that do not share memory regions.

Reviewing removed memory_region_del_subregion() calls in each patch, 
patch 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, and 14 are for memory regions with shared 
owners (that's why patch 3 can be applied without the qdev patch).
Patch 4, 5, 11 and 12 are for memory regions with different owners.

The point here is that we don't have to care whether memory regions 
share owners if we delete all subregions for defensive programming.

It is not relevant what order realize() and unrealize() are performed. 
This patch is to de-duplicate the code to unrealize devices, and commit 
ac7a892fd3 fixes a bug instead.

Indeed, people who read the implementation of devices wonder where are 
memory_region_del_subregion() calls that corresponding to 
memory_region_add_subregion() calls they see.

That said, anyone who cares device code already needs to know that 
subregions (that do not share owners) need to be deleted during 
unrealization, or devices will remain visible to the guest. I see 
avoiding this consequence is important, and it is just nice to have less 
code by de-deuplicating the memory_del_subregion() calls.

Indeed, memory_region_del_subregion() is still necessary for memory 
regions that are not directly owned by devices. This is a trade-off 
situation so there is no clear answer what's the best.
