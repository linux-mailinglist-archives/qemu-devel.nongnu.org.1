It's what I saw in the GTK+ source code.

 no window. QEMU's own simulation is running in the background - I can reac=

, but this isn't being done?

In theory it should work, with the event source added as soon as GTK+
is started... aha!

We do not use the GMainContext's poll_func, we use qemu_poll_ns.
That's the missing part: GDK replaces the poll_func with one that
calls nextEventMatchingMask:

https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/blame/main/gdk/macos/gdkmacoseventsour=
ce.c?ref_type=3Dheads#L767

There could be more issues, but I think for now it's better to block
the GTK+ UI under macOS.

Don't worry, I was mostly talking to myself... The UI thread, and more
specifically any handlers that are called from CFRunLoop instead of
QEMU's main loop, will have to use mutexes or bql_lock()/bql_unlock(),
like ui/cocoa.m already does.

In other words, code that interacts with Apple's paravirtualized
graphics needs to know if it runs from the CFRunLoop or from
qemu_main().

Hmm, no I don't remember anything like that for Windows but it's also
been many years for me.
