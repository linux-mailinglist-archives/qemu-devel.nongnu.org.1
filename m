Now I realize we used a very misleading term there :). Without
ioeventfd, when the guest writes to the PCI notification area the
guest vCPU is totally paused there, and the control is handed to
host's KVM first and QEMU after it. The same physical CPU of the
machine needs to switch context because of that.

Is an interruption of the execution and a context switch. Maybe
"paused" is a better term.

They are different, but at that part of the blog is just the direction
of who interrupts / notifies who :).

Good catch :). CCing Laurent, the author of the blog, in case he can
modify the text.
