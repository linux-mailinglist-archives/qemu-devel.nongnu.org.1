Ok - thanks for walking this through!

So is that a kernel bug?  If we have a report of a problem that
effects multiple pages, why are we not isolating them all?

Which one are we isolating? Is it the first in the reported range or
do we have some means to see which address access resulted in an SEA?

+CC kernel APEI maintainers and related to see if they have a view on what should
be happening here.

The short version of the question is: Should the kernel should be isolating
multiple pages if a CPER record has a granularity of more than a page?

This could occur if we have a guest with smaller pages than the host.
