Currently QEMU has become more and more difficult to maintain a general
topology hierarchy, there are two recent examples:

1. as you mentioned "module" v.s. "cluster", one reason for introducing
"module" is because it is difficult to define what "cluster" is for x86,
the cluster in the device tree can be nested, then it can correspond to
an x86 die, or it can correspond to an x86 module. Therefore, specifying
"clusters=1" for x86 is ambiguous.

2. s390 introduces book and drawer, which are above socket/package
level, but for x86, the level above the package names "cluster" (yeah,
"cluster" again :-(). So if user sets "books=1" or "drawers=1" for x86,
then it's meaningless. Similarly, "clusters=1" is also very confusing for
x86 machine.

I think that only thread/core/socket are architecturally general, the
other topology levels are hard to define across architectures, then
allowing unsupported topology=1 is always confusing...

Moreover, QEMU currently requires a clear topology containment
relationship when defining a topology, after which it will become
increasingly difficult to define a generic topology containment
relationship when new topology levels are introduced in the future...

I understand that libvirt is having trouble because there is no interface
to expose which topology levels the current machine supports. As a
workaround to eliminate the difficulties at the libvirt level, it's
ok for me.

But I believe deprecating the unsupported topology is necessary, so do
you think it's acceptable to include an interface to expose the supported
topology if it's going to be deprecated again later?

Zhao
