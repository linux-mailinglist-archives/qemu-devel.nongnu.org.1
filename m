We've got two mutually conflicting goals with the machine type
definitions.

Primarily we use them to ensure stable ABI, but an important
secondary goal is to enable new tunables to have new defaults
set, without having to update every mgmt app.  The latter
works very well when the defaults have no dependancy on the
platform kernel/OS, but breaks migration when they do have a
platform dependancy.

We've failed at this for years wrt enabling use of new defaults that have
a platform depedancy, so historical practice isn't a good reference.

There are 100's (possibly 1000's) of tunables set implicitly as part of
the machine type, and of those, libvirt likely only exposes a few 10's
of tunables. The vast majority are low level details that no mgmt app
wants to know about, they just want to accept QEMU's new defaults,
while preserving machine ABI. This is a good thing. No one wants the
burden of wiring up every single tunable into libvirt and mgmt apps.

This is what the "-platform" concept would be intended to preserve. It
would allow a way to enable groups of settings that have a platform level
dependancy, without ever having to teach either libvirt or the mgmt apps
about the individual tunables.


With regards,
Daniel
