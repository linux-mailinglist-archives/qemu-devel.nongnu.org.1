No, but I want to move "[PATCH v3 0/5] virtio-net: Convert feature 
properties to OnOffAuto" forward:
https://patchew.org/QEMU/20240714-auto-v3-0-e27401aabab3@daynix.com/

This will clarify the existence of the "auto" semantics, which is to 
enable a platform feature based on availability. [2] will be regarded as 
a feature to improve the handling of the "auto" semantics once this 
change lands.
