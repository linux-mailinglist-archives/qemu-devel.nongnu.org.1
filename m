After this profile work is merged I suggest:

1a - make rv64 a base cpu type, no extensions enabled by default. Change the default
CPU to 'max' like linux-user mode is already doing to avoid breaking users

OR

1b - create a new rv64base|rv64bare to be used exclusively with profiles or when users
really want to know what they're loading in the CPU. No extensions enabled by default.
'rv64' remains untouched as default CPU


I can see a case for both. 1b is less work to make it happen. Thanks,


Daniel
