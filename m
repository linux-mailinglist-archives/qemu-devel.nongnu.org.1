We now have the 'run' script concept merged, so we can do
"./run ..." and it'll "do the right thing" executing with
the python venv in $PYTHONPATH, and locally built binaries
in $PATH, etc.

What I think is missing is to ensure that qemu.qmp is *always*
available in the venv.

The split of python deps between vendored and non-vendored
pieces makes sense, but the association of 'qemu.qmp' with
tests is overlooking that qemu.qmp is used for more than
just the tests - it is also a dep of qmp-shell which is a
developer tool. Given this I think tieing install of qemu.qmp
to 'make check' (via 'make check-venv') is a mistake. Instead
we should unconditionally install it when configure is run.

We have precedent for that in --enable-rust unconditionally
installing all vendored Rust crates.  Since we vendor qemu.qmp
there's no download penalty, and timing the venv creation
shows it takes about 1 second which is insignificant in the
context of everything else configure does. 

Anyway, if we move the 'checktests' group install to configure,
then combined with the new 'run' script we would eliminate the
main behaviour regression from removing qemu.qmp from git.


Leaving the 'functests' group to be lazy installed is OK, since
as a developer if you're running a functional test directly,
that is pretty likely to be after you already had run the
'make check-functional' command and saw a failure. IOW the
venv will be populated with the needed deps.
