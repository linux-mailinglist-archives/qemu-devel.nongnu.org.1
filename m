Note that bcc8584 also drops hack with .active field to manipulate on
permissions of copy-on-read filter.

Still, I hope, that was mostly about inserting of the filter, and
bdrv_replace_node() could be kept as is, but bdrv_drop_filter() word
looked better in context (why not, if we have appropriate function).

Let's check. Hmm staying at bcc8584, and changing

For me the idea to (try to) revert 3108a15cf09 seems correct. At least,
I can't remember or find (see my paraller answer about copy-before-write)
any contradictions. The only obvious obstacle is iotest 257.
