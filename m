We have threads per-core at microarchitecture level in ARM as well. But eac=
h
thread appears like a vCPU to OS and AFAICS there are no special attributes
attached to it. SMT can be enabled/disabled at firmware and should get
reflected in the configuration accordingly i.e. value of *threads-per-core*=
=20
changes between 1 and 'N'.  This means 'vcpus_count' has to reflect the
correct configuration. But I think threads lack proper representation
in Qemu QOM.

In Qemu, each vCPU reflects an execution context (which gets uniquely mappe=
d
to KVM vCPU). AFAICS, we only have *CPUState* (Struct ArchCPU) as a placeho=
lder
for this execution context and there is no *ThreadState* (derived out of
Struct CPUState). Hence, we've  to map all the threads as QOM vCPUs. This m=
eans
the array of present or possible CPUs represented by 'struct CPUArchIdList'=
 contains
all execution contexts which actually might be vCPU or a thread. Hence, usa=
ge of
*vcpus_count* seems quite superficial to me frankly.

Also, AFAICS, KVM does not have the concept of the threads and only has
KVM vCPUs, but you are still allowed to specify the topology with sockets, =
dies,
clusters, cores, threads in most architectures. =20

Sure, but does the KVM specifies this? and how does these threads map to th=
e QOM
vCPU objects or execution context? AFAICS there is nothing but 'CPUState'
which will be made part of the  possible vCPU list 'struct CPUArchIdList'.

Well, again we need more discussion on this. I've stated my concerns agains=
t
doing this. User should be allowed to create virtual topology which will
include 'threads' as one of the parameter.
