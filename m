This is ok, however I do not think there is obvious advantage. V6 is ok 
also, there is recovery path only that recovery has problem, system will 
crash, through it is impossible now.

Maybe someone jumps out and say that there is error handling in cpu 
hotplug, however no such in pc_memory_plug(), why does not LoongArch in 
such way. If so, there will endless discussion.

void x86_cpu_plug(HotplugHandler *hotplug_dev,
                   DeviceState *dev, Error **errp)
{
     CPUArchId *found_cpu;
     Error *local_err = NULL;
     X86CPU *cpu = X86_CPU(dev);
     X86MachineState *x86ms = X86_MACHINE(hotplug_dev);

     if (x86ms->acpi_dev) {
         hotplug_handler_plug(x86ms->acpi_dev, dev, &local_err);

static void pc_memory_plug(HotplugHandler *hotplug_dev,
                            DeviceState *dev, Error **errp)
{
     PCMachineState *pcms = PC_MACHINE(hotplug_dev);
     X86MachineState *x86ms = X86_MACHINE(hotplug_dev);
     MachineState *ms = MACHINE(hotplug_dev);
     bool is_nvdimm = object_dynamic_cast(OBJECT(dev), TYPE_NVDIMM);

     pc_dimm_plug(PC_DIMM(dev), MACHINE(pcms));

     if (is_nvdimm) {
         nvdimm_plug(ms->nvdimms_state);
     }

     hotplug_handler_plug(x86ms->acpi_dev, dev, &error_abort);
}
