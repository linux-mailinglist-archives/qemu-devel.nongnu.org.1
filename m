Thanks but maybe try upstream at https://acube-systems.biz/ as they are 
still maintaining this U-Boot version and I don't want to diverge too much 
from it so it's easier to update it when a new version comes from 
upstream. (There's already a version newer than the one we have in QEMU 
but that did not work with the emulation for some reason and I did not 
have time to find out why so went with the last version that works as that 
already has the USB fixes we needed and newer version does not have 
anything we need yet but maybe in the future we'll want to update 
further.)

The code may be bad and also based on an old U-Boot version that did not 
have support for newer compilers but apparently it works on real boards 
which we try to emulate so I'd like to keep the firmware close to that one 
including bugs so it works the same as the real machine.

For things fixed in newer U-Boot versions it may be better to cherry-pick 
from there and for things that broke because of -Werror settings in Debian 
different from gcc defaults it makes sense to carry patches for that in 
Debian or merge upstream and not just in QEMU.
