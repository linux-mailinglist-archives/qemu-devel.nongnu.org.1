I was imprecise.  used_length did not change; it was introduced as being
different than max_length when resizeable ramblocks were introduced.

The max_length is not sent.  It is an implicit property of the implementation,
and can change.  It is the size of the memfd mapping, so we need to know it
and preserve it.

used_length is indeed sent during SETUP.  We could also send max_length
at that time, and store both in the struct ramblock, and *maybe* that would
be safe, but that is more fragile and less future proof than setting both
properties to the correct value when the ramblock struct is created.

And BTW, the ramblock properties are sent using ad-hoc code in setup.
I send them using nice clean vmstate.

The alignment specified by the mr to allocate a new block is an implicit property
of the implementation, and has changed before, from one qemu release to another.
Not often, but it did, and could again in the future.  Communicating the alignment
from old qemu to new qemu is future proof.

The block->fd must be preserved.  That is the fd of the memfd_create used
by cpr.

That capability as currently defined would not work for cpr.  The fd is
pre-created, but qemu still calls the kernel to configure it.  cpr skips
all kernel configuration calls.

One could imagine a solution where the manager extracts internal properties
of vfio, ramblock, etc and passes them as creation time parameters on the
new qemu command line.  And, the manager pre-creates all fd's so they
can be passed to old and new qemu. Lots of code required in qemu and in the
manager, and all implicitly created objects would need to me made explicit.
Yuck. The precreate vmstate approach is much simpler for all.

Exec must be allowed to use cpr-exec mode.  Fork can remain blocked.   Currently
the qemu sandbox option can block 'spawn', which blocks both exec and fork. I have
a patch in my next series that makes this more fine grained, so one or the other
can be blocked. Those unwilling to allow exec can wait for cpr-scm mode :)
