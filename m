My imagination was if needed we'll get complains and we add that until
then for that broken release only, and remove in the next release again.

Yep that's fine.  I think we should keep such discussion on the list,
especially we have different opinions, while none of us got convinced yet
so far. :)

Then question is how to update the script. So far it's treated as failure
on rename, even if it's benign. Right now we have this:

            print("Section \"" + sec + "\",", end=' ')
            print("Description \"" + desc + "\":", end=' ')
            print("expected field \"" + s_item["field"] + "\",", end=' ')
            print("got \"" + d_item["field"] + "\"; skipping rest")
            bump_taint()
            break

Do you want to introduce a list of renamed vmsd fields in this script and
maintain that?  IMHO it's an overkill and unnecessary burden to other
developers.

I understand your point, however I don't yet see a way CI could cover
everything.  CI won't cover performance test, and I still ran multifd tests
at least smoke it too before soft-freeze.

If there's something done wrong, we notify the sooner the better.  Now it
looks to me the best trade-off is like that - we notify at soft-freeze once
per release considering that's pretty rare too, e.g. 9.0 has no such outlier.

Again I'm happy if we have a solution to not report false negatives; that's
the only concern I have.

Yes, if you have an answer to (1) I'm ok too.  Maybe I misunderstood your
plan there.
