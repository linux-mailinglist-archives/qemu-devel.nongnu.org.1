No problem!

Currently, we have the following options:

* 1st: The first one is just to configure cache topology with several
  options in -smp:

  -smp l1i-cache-topo=core,l1d-cache-topo-core

  This one lacks scalability to support the cache size that ARM will
  need in the future.


* 2nd: The cache list object in -smp.

  The idea was to use JSON to configure the cache list. However, the
  underlying implementation of -smp at the moment is keyval parsing,
  which is not compatible with JSON.

  If we can not insist on JSON format, then cache lists can also be
  implemented in the following way:
  
  -smp caches.0.name=l1i,caches.0.topo=core,\
       caches.1.name=l1d,caches.1.topo=core


* 3rd: The cache list object linked in -machine.

  Considering that -object is JSON-compatible so that defining lists via
  JSON is more friendly, I implemented the caches list via -object and
  linked it to MachineState:

  -object '{"qom-type":"smp-cache","id":"obj","caches":[{"name":"l1d","topo":"core"},{"name":"l1i","topo":"core"}]}'
  -machine smp-caches=obj


* 4th: The per cache object without any list:

  -object smp-cache,id=cache0,name=l1i,topo=core \
  -object smp-cache,id=cache1,name=l1d,topo=core

  This proposal is clearer, but there are a few opens:
  - I plan to push qom-topo forward, which would abstract CPU related
    topology levels and cache to "device" instead of object. Is there a
    conflict here?

  - Multiple cache objects can't be linked to the machine on the command
    line, so I maintain a static cache list in smp_cache.c and expose
    the cache information to the machine through some interface. is this
    way acceptable?


In summary, the 4th proposal was the most up in the air, as it looked to
be conflict with the hybrid topology I wanted to do (and while hybrid
topology may not be accepted by the community either, I thought it would
be best for the two work to be in the same direction).

The difference between 2nd and 3rd is about the JSON requirement, if JSON
is mandatory for now then it's 3rd, if it's not mandatory (or accept to
make -machine/-smp support JSON in the future), 2nd looks cleaner, which
puts the caches list in -smp.

Zhao
