The U-Boot version I've tested (or something else, I don't remember) 
wanted to set the CCSRBAR to the value it expects which is different from 
where it looks for it at reset and that works with this patch. I don't 
know which code path that corresponds to in start.S.

I did not notice that. Maybe it's only relevant with KVM and I've only 
tested with TCG or could be I did not get to the part yet when this would 
cause problems. I don't see an easy way to update this as these are in 
separate places and also don't know how this mpic_iack is handled with 
multiple cores. So in case this patch breaks this then it's OK to drop it 
for now. I can carry it locally until fixed upstream.

Some of that series was already merged. What are the outstanding patches 
and discussions? I don't remember seeing an updated version of that series 
with only the outstanding patches.
