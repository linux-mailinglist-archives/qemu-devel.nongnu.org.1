I'm afraid I don't know any contact there, but someone else on
CC might.

FWIW, when I first investigated DMARC/DKIM/SPF in the context of
mailing lists years ago, the following blog was a good explainer
to refer people to:

  https://begriffs.com/posts/2018-09-18-dmarc-mailing-list.html

TL;DR: if DMARC is used by a sender's domain, then the best
situation is for the sender domain to have DMARC + DKIM enabled,
AND for mailing lists to NOT modify the message text, nor any of
the headers covered by DKIM.

We believe qemu-devel does the latter part correctly, as we
turned off modification of the Subject header, and stopped
appending a footer to the message text.

Unfortunately I don't know any way to trace the cause of your
problems without info from the mail system logs on the mailing
list server, which only the sysadmins have access to :-(

With regards,
Daniel
