I really appreciate your patience and explanations, and your feedback
and review has helped me a lot!

Yes, simple repetition creates much maintenance burden (though I'm happy
to help with), and the argument for current performance isn't convincing
enough.

Getting back to the project itself, as you have said, the core is still
further support for TCG-related traces, and I'll continue to work on it,
and then look back based on such work to see what issues there are with
traces or what improvements can be made.

Thanks again!

Regards,
Zhao
