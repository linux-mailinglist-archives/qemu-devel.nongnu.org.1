TDX is one of the reasons for this patch, but not the whole reason.

just when users try to boot a VM with "-cpu *,+ht -smp n" where n > 1.

This is a valid user configuration. Before commit 83629b1, it got 
warning, and commit 83629b1 tried to fix the warning.

I don't object on this direction.

But it has nothing to do with this patch. This patch is trying to track 
HT in env->features[].

Again, I don't object on this direction. But it's another thing against 
this patch.

Sorry? it is you said "users should configure it in the BIOS". I was 
curious on it
