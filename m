I need to come back to this aspect of it - the cross release or cross
qemu version migrations.

Hector (on CC) helps me on that now - sadly we were able to confirm
that migrations from older qemu versions no longer work.
Yep 10.1 is released by now so it might end up as "The problem is what
happens when we detect after we have done a release that something has
gone wrong" from [2].
But I still can't believe only we see this and therefore for now want
to believe I messed up on our side when merging 10.1 :-)

For now this is a call if others have also seen any older release
migrating to 10.1 to throw:
  error: operation failed: guest CPU doesn't match specification:
missing features: pdcm,arch-capabilities

Hector will later today reply here with a summary of what we found so
far, to provide you a more complete picture to think about, without
having to read through all the messy interim steps in the Ubuntu bug.
