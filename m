Maybe I missed something, but it seems like it just checks/copies the 
generated.rs file where it's expected. Definitely something that could 
be done as part of the rust build.

Having to run the build before getting completion does not seem to be a 
huge compromise.

If there must be a discussion about dependencies, it's probably better 
to consider the "worse" case to take a decison about vendoring this or not.

I understand.
Stripping rust binary does a big difference in size, including for 
release builds.
I hope we'll explore other options than using no_std if binary size 
should become a decisive criteria.
