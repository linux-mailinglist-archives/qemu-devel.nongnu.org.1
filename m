It should be easy to do, but now I'm thinking how much it would help
developers.

As discussed above, I finally went through the list for the previous
release cycle, and I see no real positive reports.

It could be that the script used to be able to capture more real issues,
but as more developers / maintainers got reports, then such issues are less
likely to happen.  Do any of us used that to find any real bug recently?

I also start to doubt whether we should keep growing the renaming list.
First of all, such list isn't that helpful if we don't run that on old
enough binaries - the rename will not cause false positive anymore as long
as we compare newer binaries from the commit it got changed.  So if we run
it per-release the rename will only bother us once per release..

So now I start to question whether we need to work more on the whole
vmstate static checker..  I think I'll still try to keep running it once
per release for some while, but if I can't catch any real bug maybe we're
good from this regard, and people just started being very cautious on
e.g. randomly adding or removing vmsd fields.

Let me know if anyone thinks it differently..
