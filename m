When I spoke to Mario at DVCon last year I liked the idea of re-using
QMP instead of inventing yet another RPC interface for QEMU. QMP
certainly has nicer properties than the gdbstub which has a very
"organic" and "serial" feel to it.

Are you suggesting we re-use the machinery but use an entirely separate
socket with just the MCD namespace in it? I don't see that being a
problem as long as we can test it properly in the CI.
