Not sure if I would call that a "real fix", it's more like a hack.
Kernel images aren't block devices and their size may not even be
aligned to 512, which is the minimum block size the block layer
supports. So there might be some complications around that area.

That said, even if it's an abuse of the block layer, it might be a
useful abuse that saves you writing quite a bit of FILE * based logic
providing similar functionality, so who I am to stop you...
