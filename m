The ACPI HEST tables, in particular when using GHESv2 provide
several kinds of errors. Among them, we have ARM Processor Error,
as defined at UEFI 2.10 spec (and earlier versions), the Common
Platform Error Record (CPER) is defined as:

   https://uefi.org/specs/UEFI/2.10/Apx_N_Common_Platform_Error_Record.html?highlight=ghes#arm-processor-error-section

There are two fields that are part of the CPER record. One of them is
mandatory (MIDR); the other one is optional, but needed to decode another
field.

So, basically those errors need them.

> Why is it experimental? 

This was a suggestion from Igor. As for now the QAPI for external
error injection is experimental, It makes sense to me to keep it
experimental as well.

I saw that. Basically the decoding by OS guest depends on MPIDR,
as explained at the description of Error affinity level field:

	"For errors that can be attributed to a specific affinity level, 
	this field defines the affinity level at which the error was 
	produced, detected, and/or consumed. This is a value between 0
	and 3. All other values (4-255) are reserved

	For example, a vendor may choose to define affinity levels as
	follows:
	Level 0: errors that can be precisely attributed to a specific CPU
	(e.g. due to a synchronous external abort)
	Level 1: Cache parity and/or ECC errors detected at cache of affinity
	level 1 (e.g. only attributed to higher level cache due to 
	prefetching and/or error propagation)

	NOTE: Detailed meanings and groupings of affinity level are chip 
	and/or platform specific. The affinity level described here must 
	be consistent with the platform definitions used MPIDR. For
	cache/TLB errors, the cache/TLB level is provided by the cache/TLB
	error structure, which may differ from affinity level."

Mauro
