You mean if the "body" has just one paragraph, right?  The "body" is the
first section, always untagged, possibly empty.  It's contains the text
between the line naming the definition and the first tagged section.

The tagged sections are member / argument descriptions, feature
descriptions, 'Returns', 'Errors', 'Since', and 'TODO'.

Uh, this can't be quite right.

Consider:

    ##
    # @query-memory-size-summary:
    #
    # Return the amount of initially allocated and present hotpluggable
    # (if enabled) memory in bytes.
    #
    # .. qmp-example::
    #
    #     -> { "execute": "query-memory-size-summary" }
    #     <- { "return": { "base-memory": 4294967296, "plugged-memory": 0 }=
 }
    #
--> # Since: 2.11
    ##

There is a tagged section.  According to your explanation, the text
above, i.e. everything between @query-memory-size-summary: and Since: is
assumed to be "intro".

According to your patch, which adds "Details:" in the middle, we do not
assume this.  Contradiction.

> It's only in this case that it whines:

Let's take a step back.  docs/devel/qapi-code-gen.rst:

    Definition documentation starts with a line naming the definition,
    followed by an optional overview, a description of each argument (for
    commands and events), member (for structs and unions), branch (for
    alternates), or value (for enums), a description of each feature (if
    any), and finally optional tagged sections.

Bug: should be "finally optional tagged or untagged sections".

Your generator wants all but 'Since' and 'TODO' together, so it can
render them in a single two-column table.

This description table separates "intro" (above) and "details" (below).
Fair?

Fine and dandy separation unless the description table is *empty*.

Then the "body" (first section, always untagged) extends to the first
'Since', 'TODO', or the end of the doc comment.

Heuristic: when this first untagged section is a single paragraph, we
quietly assume it's "intro".  If it's more than one, we ask the
programmer to mark the end of "intro" explicitly.

Let's see how this works out in practice.  I stick

        if self.symbol and not (self.args or self.features or self.returns =
or self.errors):
            if self.body.text.find('\n\n') =3D=3D -1:
                print(f"{self.info}: single para")
            else:
                print(f"{self.info}: ambiguous")

into QAPIDoc.check().  The outer conditional is true for definition
documentation (doc.symbol) where the table is empty (not ...).  The
inner conditional is a crude check for paragraphs.

This reports 47 "single para" and 8 "ambiguous" in the main QAPI schema
in master.

Your patch hits 5 of 8 ambiguous ones, and throws in a 6th that doesn't
seem to need it:

    ##

    #
    # Query yank instances.  See @YankInstance for more information.
    #

    #
    #     -> { "execute": "query-yank" }

The ambiguity affects both doc blocks the inliner inlines from and doc
blocks the inliner inlines into.

When inlining from, the inliner omits "intro", and therefore needs to
know where "intro" ends.

When inlining into, the inliner needs to know where to insert the
inlined material.  When the answer is "right after intro", it needs to
know where "intro" ends.

Getting the former wrong loses information.  Getting the latter wrong
may look funny, which is a lot less serious, but still useful to avoid.

Yes.


Let's take a step back again.

Recall the problem's cause is "empty description table".  Can we enforce
non-empty?

Here's the table's syntactic structure:

    member / argument descriptions *
    ( "Features:" line
       feature descriptions ("features") + ) ?
    "Returns" section ?
    "Errors" section ?

This is slightly more strict than what we actually accept now, but
that's detail.

Consider:

    "Members:" / "Arguments:" line
    member / argument descriptions *
    ( "Features:" line
       feature descriptions ("features") + ) ?
    "Returns" section ?
    "Errors" section ?

With this, the table always starts with a "Members" / "Arguments" line,
and thus cannot be empty.

Drawback: we'd have to add this line to every single definition comment.
The main QAPI schema has almost 1000.  Tolerable?

We could require it only when there are no member / argument
descriptions.  55 instances.

We could require it only when there are none, and our "one paragraph"
heuristic for finding the end of "intro" fails.  8 instances.

You might ask what the difference to your "Details:" proposal is.  There
are two.

1. The keyword(s).  Matter of taste, best discussed last.

2. As coded, your patch accepts "Details:" almost[*] anywhere.
   "Members:" / "Arguments" would be accepted only where member / argument
   descriptions can go, i.e. not after feature descriptions etc.  Consider:

    ##
    # @Enum:
    #
    # @one: The _one_ {and only}, description on the same line
    #
    # Features:
    # @enum-feat: Also _one_ {and only}
    # @enum-member-feat: a member feature
    #
    # Details:
    #
    # @two is undocumented
    ##

   This is accepted, and the "Details:" line gets swallowed.

   I figure tightening the position makes accidents slightly less
   likely.

Here's another way to force non-empty:

    ( "Members: none" / "Arguments: none" line
    | member / argument descriptions * )
    ( "Features:" line
       feature descriptions ("features") + ) ?
    "Returns" section ?
    "Errors" section ?

This is similar to "require it only when there are no member / argument
descriptions" above, except we also accept it only then.  55 instances.

Syntax ideas better than "Members: none" are welcome.

Thoughts?


[*] Not after untagged sections following tagged ones.
