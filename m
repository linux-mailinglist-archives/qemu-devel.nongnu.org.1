Since lists.fp.o is being rather unreliable today...

Don't.
-gsplit-dwarf is something to get faster link times at the expense of slower
debugging and more files around.
So, it can be useful for fast modify/rebuild/test cycles during development,
but is something that is really undesirable for the distro builds.
There you don't mind slightly longer link times, that is done once per
build, but having to ship larger debug info and especially when it is split
into hundreds or thousands of small files is then a price everybody who
downloads the package debuginfo pays.
debugedit can't deal with it, dwz can't either, in order to ship something
reasonable one would need to dwp the separate debug info back into the
normal debug info.
