IME of running Debian sid in CI pipelines for libvirt, it is
way too unstable to be used as a gating job. There are periods
weeks-long when packages fail to install, even for relatively
mainstream arch targets like x86, let alone a new target like
riscv.

Running the job by default is sane, but it should not be made
gating until in a formal Debian release IMHO.
