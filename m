I prefer few generic commands to many specialized commands whenever
practical.  However, designing a generic interface can be harder,
sometimes much harder, than designing a specialized one.

The generic command Salil proposed has serious flaws, as discussed
upthread.  None of us has promising ideas on how to do a generic command
that isn't flawed by design.  A more specialized one seems to be the
only visible path forward.
