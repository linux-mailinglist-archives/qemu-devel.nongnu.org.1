Initially, the flag -mcx16 was forced in definition of CC in meson cross 
file (see c2bf2ccb266dc9ae4a6da75b845f54535417e109).
When it was removed and added in meson.build instead, it silently 
deactivated cmpxchg128 feature detection, and since everything still 
compiles/links correctly, we didn't notice until a recent investigation 
on a performance issue.

Root cause if that we try to identify a feature that depends on a 
specific compilation flag, and it's a scenario for which 
cc.compiles/cc.links is not designed out of the box. So it's normal that 
we have to add this flag manually somewhere.

I feel that having this explicitely in the meson.build is better than 
implicitly define it in value of CC.

I'm open to any idea you would like, we just need to have this flag 
somewhere, that's what fix the problem.

Regards,
Pierrick
