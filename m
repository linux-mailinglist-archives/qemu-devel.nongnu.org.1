I think it used to only wait() in the preempt thread, so that is needed.
It's also needed when postcopy is interrupted and need a recover, see
loadvm_postcopy_handle_resume(), in that case it's the postcopy ram load
thread that waits for it rather than the main thread or preempt thread.

Indeed if we move channel creation out of the preempt thread then it seems
we don't need the sem in this path.  However the other path will still need
it, then when the new channel created (postcopy_preempt_new_channel) we'll
need to identify a "switch to postcopy" case or "postcopy recovery" case,
only post the sem when the former.  I think it might complicate the code,
I'll think again tomorrow after a sleep so my brain will work better, but I
doubt this is what we want to do at rc3.

If you feel comfortable, please feel free to send a version that you think
is the most correct so far (if you prefer no timedwait it's fine), and make
sure the test works the best on your side.  Then I'll smoke it a bit during
weekends. Please always keep that in mind if that will be for rc3 it should
be non-intrusive change, or we keep it slow for 9.1 and we don't need to
rush.

Thanks,
