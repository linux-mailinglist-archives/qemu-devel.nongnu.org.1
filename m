Hi qemu contributors!

Thanks so much for those of you who joined out first and second calls
regarding LLM-generated contributions. We were incredibly happy to hear
new perspectives and the community sentiment around these tools. As we
incorporate some of the new ideas into our thinking we are adding one
more session (we realize our last session aimed for EU timezones fell on
a holiday there). That will be:

date -d "2024-11-12 15:00 UTC"

And a reminder for the one coming up soon targetting Asia-Pacific
timezones.

date -d "2024-11-06 04:00 UTC"

Both of the above will happen in the same BigBlueButton room as before:

  https://bbb.sfconservancy.org/b/oss-nnj-obi-jea

If these times do not work for you, please feel free to write us at
info@sfconservancy.org with any thoughts you'd like us to consider.

Thanks!
-Pono
