That's the wrong commit - I documented the delayed impl of deletion
in a separate commit, so that we could just revert that part on its
own in 10.1 dev:

  commit c9fd2d9a48ee3c195cf83cc611b87b09f02f0013
  Author: Daniel P. Berrangé <berrange@redhat.com>
  Date:   Thu Jun 20 17:57:37 2024 +0100

    include/hw: temporarily disable deletion of versioned machine types
    
    The new deprecation and deletion policy for versioned machine types is
    being introduced in QEMU 9.1.0.
    
    Under the new policy a number of old machine types (any prior to 2.12)
    would be liable for immediate deletion which would be a violation of our
    historical deprecation and removal policy
    
    Thus automatic deletions (by skipping QOM registration) are temporarily
    gated on existance of the env variable "QEMU_DELETE_MACHINES" / QEMU
    version number >= 10.1.0. This allows opt-in testing of the automatic
    deletion logic, while activating it fully in QEMU >= 10.1.0.
    
    This whole commit should be reverted in the 10.1.0 dev cycle or shortly
    thereafter.

If a machine type was deprected *before* the 9.1 release cycle, I think
it is fair game to delete it under the historical deprecation rules.

If a machine type was deprecated in 9.1, or later cycles, I think that
deletion is gated until 10.1.0 under the policy applied by that commit
above.

With regards,
Daniel
