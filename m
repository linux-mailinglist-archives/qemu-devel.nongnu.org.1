On the cloud provider side*, we do rely on having rollbacks work.

We rely on staged deployments with rolling back if things go wrong
as we observe progress.

Note that the set of MSRs KVM gives (at least on AArch64) does sometimes
vary between releases so for rolling back you=E2=80=99ll need to ignore =
some (new)=20
sysregs in the vmm. With careful planning so that you deploy a VMM
release with a point-fix to ignore the new registers and then the kernel =
update.

So not dealing with that would make the cloud use case not usable =
without=20
downstream patches.

*although we don=E2=80=99t rely on Qemu for Nitro System VMs
