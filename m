Hi Andrea :

     So, just to be clear, you're not suggesting either of the options I 
suggested above,

     are you? And still recommend that we use a two-piece pflash 
solution similar to other architectures,

      right?


Hi Philippe :

   I look forward to your reply and the comments of other members of the 
qemu community very much.

  If everyone has no opinions,

I will submit a patch to the community to change the loading mode of 
qemu under loongarch architecture to UEFI with two pieces of pflash.


Thanks,

Xianglai.
