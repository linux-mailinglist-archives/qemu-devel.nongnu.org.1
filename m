I'm always skeptical of "hangs" being fixed with shutdown(), when the
multifd code has had multiple issues with incorrect locking and ordering
of thread creation/deletion.

Speaking of TLS, enabling asan and running the TLS tests crashes QEMU in
a very obscure way. May or may not be related to thread termination
issues. I've been skipping postcopy/recovery/tls/psk when doing asan
builds for a while now. Just FYI, I'm not asking we take action on this
and I'm keeping an eye on it.
