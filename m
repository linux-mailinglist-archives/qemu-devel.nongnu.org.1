Ok, got it. Such change was not easy, but I finally figured out how
to make it actually work.

I'll address tomorrow your comment on patch 5/10 about using raw data also 
for the other parts of CPER (generic error status and generic error data).

If you want to do a sneak peak, I'm keeping the latest development
version here:

	https://gitlab.com/mchehab_kernel/qemu/-/commits/qemu_submission?ref_type=heads

In particular, the patch changing from /etc/hardware_errors offset to
a HEST offset is at:

	https://gitlab.com/mchehab_kernel/qemu/-/commit/9197d22de09df97ce3d6725cb21bd2114c2eb43c

It contains several cleanups to make the logic clearer and more robust.

Thanks,
Mauro
