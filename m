Sorry about only reacting now, was AFK.

So one usecase that to me seems entirely valid, is refactoring.

For example, change a function prototype, or a structure,
and have an LLM update all callers.

The only part of the patch that is expressive is the
actual change, the rest is a technicality and has IMHO nothing to do with
copyright. LLMs can just do it with no hassle.


Can we soften this to only apply to expressive code?

I feel a lot of cleanups would be enabled by this.
