I'm re-wording the commit message to:

  The 'loaded' property on TLS creds and secret objects was marked as
  deprecated in 6.0.0. In 7.1.0 the deprecation info was moved into
  the 'removed-features.rst' file, but the property was not actually
  removed, just made read-only. This was a highly unusual practice,
  so finish the long overdue removal job.

and removing the "Fixes" tag
