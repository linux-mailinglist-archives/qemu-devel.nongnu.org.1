CC libvirt / Jiri, for confirmation about whether the CPUID restrictions
listed below will have any possible impact on libvirt CPUID handling...

This is where I'm wondering if libvirt has anything to be concerned
about. Possibly when libvirt queries the actual CPUID after launching
the guest it will just "do the right thing" ? Wondering if there's any
need for libvirt to be aware of CPUID restrictions before that point
though ?

I don't think we need to show 'kernel-irqchip=split' now that we "do the
right thing" by default


This surely also ought to include '-accel kvm', as IIUC there's no
TCG support for TDX.

And presumably '-cpu host', since QEMU's default 'qemu64' CPU model
is likely a terrible match for what TDX will force set.

Can append

   "This is set by default for TDX guests if kernel-irqchip is left on
    its default 'auto' setting."
