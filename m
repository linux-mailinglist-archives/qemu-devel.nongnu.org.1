I didn't want to put those in tier 3 since I think they're generally
better than that. Perhaps this bullet should be loosened slightly

   "May run some tests frameworks in CI"

Opps, I knew I'd miss something :-)

Yep, this doc is slightly anticipating the future. I was expecting
that Richard's series:

  https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2026-01/msg03073.html

will be merged soon enough.

Hmm, true, we should be blocking atttempts to build. So anycode related
to unclassified OS would be non-buildable and definitely OK to remove.
