For this case, maybe it needs the "Co-developed-by"?

Maybe just a question, the people should drop the Reviewed/ACKed/Tested
tags that have been obtained if he make the any code changes (including
function/variable renaming) as well as commit message changes during
the patch refresh process, am I understand correctly? ;-)

Is there any requirement for the order of tags?

My previous understanding was that if the Reviewed-by/Tested-by tags
were obtained by the author within his company, then those tags should
be placed before the signed-off-by of the author. If the Reviewed-by/
Tested-by were acquired in the community, then they should be placed
after the author's signed-off-by, right?

I find some people added Originally-by, e.g., 8e86851bd6b9.

I guess if the code has been changed very significantly, or if the
original implementation has just been referenced and significantly
refactored, then Originally-by should be preferred instead of
Signed-off-by from the original author, right?
