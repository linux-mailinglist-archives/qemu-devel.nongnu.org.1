_STA and ACPI cphp registers are per logical CPU and can't be anything else
per spec.

how different granularity is relevant here?

hook is more complicated and hidden way, than directly passing down
configuration data to routine that builds AML where it is needed,
but that's cosmetics in the end.

However there is more to your hook approach, it exposes is_present bit
in cphp flag register which is ABI to guest which we will have to
maintain forever and guest will do not necessary round-trip to QEMU
to query it, while alternative is much simpler AML change without any
ABI changes to care about.

The point is we shouldn't add new ABI unless we have to.
In this case new ABI (is_presence flag) is not _must_,
and much simpler static AML change is sufficient.

It is better to get rid of not necessary hook altogether, and
replace it with a simple AML change.

beside snippet, I've suggested. You need to delete all is_present callback
related logic, than it save quite a bit, and not only on lines of code.

I guess, I need to send a patch to get point across.

what has been done in v3 is moving is_present/is_enabled,
elsewhere (callbacks in this case). While argument was that
both are not necessary to begin with.

Reality of your last posted main series (v5), disagrees with what you are saying here

 [PATCH RFC V5 12/30] arm/virt: Release objects for *disabled* possible vCPUs after init
  https://patchew.org/QEMU/20241015100012.254223-1-salil.mehta@huawei.com/20241015100012.254223-13-salil.mehta@huawei.com/

after this patch, new is_present hook would let you bury the lie
about CPU being present inside ARM specific code.

One can write anything and it can even work somehow,
that however doesn't mean it's something merge-able,
maintainable, ...whatever else come to mind...
