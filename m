See:

https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/devel/qapi-code-gen.html

        Sometimes, the behaviour of QEMU changes compatibly, but without a
        change in the QMP syntax (usually by allowing values or operations
        that previously resulted in an error). QMP clients may still need
        to know whether the extension is available.

        For this purpose, a list of features can be specified for
        definitions, enumeration values, and struct members. Each feature
        list member can either be { 'name': STRING, '*if': COND }, or
        STRING, which is shorthand for { 'name': STRING }.

It's a legacy issue as not all features are developed together, and that
was planned to be fixed together with handshake.  I think the handshake
could introduce one header on top to pair channels.

IMHO it is an overkill to add a feature now if it works even if tricky,
because it's not the 1st day it was tricky. And we're going to have another
header very soon..
