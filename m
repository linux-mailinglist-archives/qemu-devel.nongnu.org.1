Currently the comments in the Rust pl011 register.rs file include
large amounts of text from the PL011 TRM.  This is much more
commentary than we typically quote from a device reference manual,
and much of it is not relevant to QEMU.  Compress and rephrase the
comments so that we are not quoting such a large volume of TRM text.

We add a URL for the TRM; readers who need more detail on the
function of the register bits can find it there, presented in
context with the overall description of the hardware.
