Functions that could just as well return -1 instead of errno exist.

Functions that return negative errno with callers that use them also
exist.

I'm not going to speculate on relative frequency.

I much prefer written function contracts.  But if a caller relies on
negative errno codes, there is an unwritten contract whether we like it
or not.
