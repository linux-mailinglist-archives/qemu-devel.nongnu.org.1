scsi_device_for_each_req_async() currently does not provide any way to
be awaited.  One of its callers is scsi_device_purge_requests(), which
therefore currently does not guarantee that all requests are fully
settled when it returns.

We want all requests to be settled, because scsi_device_purge_requests()
is called through the unrealize path, including the one invoked by
virtio_scsi_hotunplug() through qdev_simple_device_unplug_cb(), which
most likely assumes that all SCSI requests are done then.

In fact, scsi_device_purge_requests() already contains a blk_drain(),
but this will not fully await scsi_device_for_each_req_async(), only the
I/O requests it potentially cancels (not the non-I/O requests).
However, we can have scsi_device_for_each_req_async() increment the BB
in-flight counter, and have scsi_device_for_each_req_async_bh()
decrement it when it is done.  This way, the blk_drain() will fully
await all SCSI requests to be purged.

This also removes the need for scsi_device_for_each_req_async_bh() to
double-check the current context and potentially re-schedule itself,
should it now differ from the BB's context: Changing a BB's AioContext
with a root node is done through bdrv_try_change_aio_context(), which
creates a drained section.  With this patch, we keep the BB in-flight
counter elevated throughout, so we know the BB's context cannot change.
