Put this paragraph to the commit log, this is useful.

This is sort of what SLOF does - uses physical addresses of nodes.

afair it does.

tl;dr: no, we want properties.

Stable phandles (vs fdt offset or address) was one of the main triggers to write this VOF in the first place as we already have a few predefined phandles in pseries - interrupt controller and something else, my memory is weak. They go to SLOF which then tells the QEMU what the actual phandle is [1].

When a PCI host bridge is plugged into a pseries VM - there is no SLOF at this point but there an fdt node with a reference to the XICS phandle. And this ibm,client-architecture-support thing (which can enforce reduced number of threads-per-core and things like that) which causes rebuilding of the tree which involves QEMU creating a diff, feeding it back to SLOF which then would update its internal tree (which happens when SLOF is juuust about do die and it is not not really functional any more) to then build FDT (and do [1], again) - and this requires matching phandles in the nodes.
