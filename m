Configuring onboard devices is an old problem, and so far we have failed
at solving it adequately.

-device / device_add let you configure the new device in a general way,
but these work only for device the user creates, not for devices the
board creates automatically.

We have a bunch of ad hoc and mostly ancient ways to configure them, but
they're all limited.  For example:

* A number of old command line options, such as -drive, -serial, -net
  nic, create device backends and additionally deposit configuration in
  some global table the board may elect to use however it sees fit.  The
  intended use is to create frontends connected to these backends.

  Some boards error out when they can't honor something in the table.
  Others silently ignore parts of the table, or all of it.  Bad UI.

  Device configuration the table doesn't support is not accessible this
  way.  If you extend the table (and the associated option) to provide
  access to some device-specific configuration, all the other devices
  will silently ignore the new configuration bits.  Again, bad UI.

  There's another serious issue with block devices: -drive is obsolete
  for configurating complex block backends.  But its replacement
  -blockdev is for backend configuration only.  If you use -blockdev,
  you can't add to the table.

* Command line option -global lets you change property defaults.  This
  can be used to configure an onboard device as long as it is the only
  such device in the system.  Limited use, and also bad UI.

A modern attempt at a solution is to have machine properties alias
properties of onboard devices, so you can specify them with -machine.
For instance, a few machines expose the "drive" property of two onboard
pflash devices as machine properties "pflash0" and "pflash1".

Commits

    e0561e60f170 (hw/arm/virt: Support firmware configuration with -blockde=
v)
    ebc29e1beab0 (pc: Support firmware configuration with -blockdev)=20

explain this in a lot more detail in their commit messages.

Sadly, this solution does not scale.  Adding alias properties to the
machine object is work, sometimes a lot of work (evidence: the two
commits above).  There are simply too many onboard devices with too many
properties to all manually alias.

Of course, even an insufficiently general / scalable solution like this
one can work well enough for specific cases.

Using block backends to specify the contents of a memory device is a bit
of a hack.  However, it's the hacky solution we use, and until we have a
better solution, new code is well advised to stick to the same hacky
solution we use in existing code.

Why is it a bit of a hack?  Well, memory isn't a block device.  For
read-only memory, all we want from the block device is slurping in some
image in its entirety.  We're not interesting in reading parts, or
writing at all.  For writable memory, we are interested in writing, but
there's often a awkward translation to block device blocks.

I don't love this solution, but it's what we use elsewhere.  I think
C=C3=A9dric is right.
