I seem to remember the virtio stuff is particularly complicated, but remember
other lists as well.

Well maybe pre_load; but anything that might start happening once the
state has been loaded that shouldn't start happening until migration ends;
I think there are some devices that do it properly and wait for end of migration.

I was just thinking aloud; but was thinking of NIC activity or maybe
UI stuff?  But just guesses.
