Oh, I didn't think about checking the NBD block driver for such an
option :) And thank you for all the explanations!

I might just go with the above for now, but who knows if I'll get around
to this some day. Three approaches that come to mind are:

1. qemu-img bitmap --dump

Other bitmap actions won't be supported in combination with NBD.

2. qemu-img map --bitmap NAME

Should it use a dedicated output format compared to the usual "map"
output (both human and json) with just "start/offset + length + dirty
bit" triples?

3. qemu-nbd --map CONTEXT

With only supporting one context at a time? Would be limited to NBD of
course which the other two won't be.


All would require connecting to the NBD export with the correct meta
context, which currently means using x_dirty_bitmap internally. So would
that even be okay as part of a non-experimental command, or would it
require to teach the NBD client code to deal with multiple meta contexts
first?

Fiona
