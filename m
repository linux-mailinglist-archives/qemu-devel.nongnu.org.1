Changes since RFC:
- rebase

Question:
- I could enable this for all PCIe device (including ports).
  Does that makes sense, or is it better to limit this to my cases?
  It is quite easy to build broken setups (downstream device reports
  faster link than the port etc) because QEMU 'link' training' is
  simplistic.  I'm not sure it is worth making it more clever.

The Generic Ports support added the ability to describe the bandwidth and
Latency within a host to a CXL host bridge.  To be able to test the of the
discovery path used by Linux [1] we also need to be able to create
bottlenecks at difference places in the topology. There are two parts to
this
* CXL link characteristics as described by PCI Express Capability Link
  status etc.
* Bandwidth and latency across CXL Switches (via CDAT data from the switch
  USP)
* Bandwidth and latency from the CXL type 3 device port to the actual
  memory (Via CDAT data from the EP).

Currently we have fixed values for the CXL CDAT tables, and to test this
I recommend changing those as per the patch at the end of this cover letter
(so they aren't always the bottleneck). Making those configurable will be
handled in a future patch set.

RFC has a set of examples but those were to help testing the kernel code
rather than providing much info for QEMU review so I haven't repeated
them ehre.
