I fear it would be prone to misuse.

Consider

    Error *err = NULL;

    if (!frobnicate(a, b, c, &err)) {
        error_report_err(err);
        // cleanup here, if any
        return false;
    }

With a special &error_fatal_without_exit (terrible name, but you get
what I mean), we could shorten this to

    if (!frobnicate(a, b, c, &error_fatal_without_exit)) {
        // cleanup here, if any
        return false;
    }

However, this invites

    frobnicate(a, b, c, &error_fatal_without_exit);

which is almost always wrong.  If it's an error, we normally can't just
continue as if nothing had happened.

We should make the common case as easy to get rigtht as we can.

Making the exceptions even easier invites misuse.

> There are also warn_report*() functions which also have the same problem. A comprehensive solution needs to deal with them all. Removing all of them will do but may not be practical. Another possibility is that to write a documentation telling warning should be avoided for unhandled/programming errors and let all refer to it.

I can look into improving the commit message after my vacation.

Thanks!
