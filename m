I could have missed something, but I still think it's the same issue.  In
general, I think we want to provide different levels of tests, like:

  - Level 1: the minimum set of tests (aka, the "smoke" idea here)
  - Level 2: normal set of tests (aka, whatever we used to run by default)
  - Level 3: slow tests (aka, only ran with '-m slow' before)
  - Level 4: flaky tests (aka, only ran when QEMU_TEST_FLAKY_TESTS set)

Then we want to run level1 test only in tcg, and level1+2 in kvm.  We can
only trigger level 1-3 or level 1-4 in manual tests.

We used to have different way to provide the level idea, now I think we can
consider provide that level in migration-test in one shot.  Obviously it's
more than quick/slow so I don't think we can reuse "-m", but we can add our
own test level "--level" parameter, so --level N means run all tests lower
than level N, for example.

So I wonder if we can provide four levels, as above.. and define it for
each test in migration-test.

Indeed it'll need a few extra lines in meson, but it doesn't look too bad,
but yeah if anyone is not happy with it we can rethink.  I just want to
know whether it's still acceptable.

I tried to code it up, it looks like this:

I still used "-m" but just to show the idea.  I also wonder whether other
tests would have similar demands.. otherwise are we destined to not be able
to use qtest cmdline at all as long as we use meson?

We can definitely hijack argv/argc before passing it over to glib.

Not the only issue, but the idea of it. In general, IMHO it'll be good we
don't attach host info to a test program.

IOW, I want to keep the test in a way so that we'll be able to run whatever
level of test on whatever host, at least when when I run migration-test
manually.

So e.g. I also want to be able to run full set of tests on TCG too whenever
needed.  So I still feel like we mangled these two issues together which
might be unnecessarily.
