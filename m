there were some errata related to the spec yesterday but the bones and
intention is there. as I haven't seen page tables deployed in this way
to check self maps in a physical tree; and the primary intent, which is
to set permission for PTE zones and page table page monitoring. so
there may be some more bugs when we try to test it out in a simulator.

- https://github.com/michaeljclark/glyph/
- https://metaparadigm.com/~mclark/glyph-20250623.pdf

errata:

- swap the supervisor and physical address space prefixes
   to be consistent with Linux kernel address space on x86-64.
- physical permission self-mapping check is only on leaf entries
- fix rename P bit to T bit in 64-bit page table entry structure

turns out that if we add an 'internal' AS it would be ..FFFE0000..
so we could think about adding an internal address space prefix.

Michael.
