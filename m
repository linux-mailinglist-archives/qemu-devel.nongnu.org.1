* Only in the TLS case - the non-TLS doesn't set any error even with
premature_ok==true (assuming there hasn't been any other error during
receive)

* If there *has* been other any other error during receive then it
will be set and the code flow will be the same even with premature_ok==true.

The GNUTLS_E_PREMATURE_TERMINATION error can't happen in the non-TLS case
so by definition we can't ignore it in the non-TLS case.

And we don't ignore any other error in the TLS/non-TLS case.

So in this case we should set the QIO_CHANNEL_READ_RELAXED_EOF flag on
the multifd channel recv thread main loop only, and leave the
mid-stream page receive methods report GNUTLS_E_PREMATURE_TERMINATION
as usual.

This makes the TLS case work the same with respect to premature
EOF as the non-TLS case since the non-TLS case can't detect premature
EOF in the multifd channel recv thread main loop either.

If we do some kind of a premature EOF detection then it should probably
work for the non-TLS case too (since that's probably by far the most
common use case).
So adding some MULTIFD_FLAG_EOS would make the most sense and would work
even with QIO_CHANNEL_READ_RELAXED_EOF being set.

In any case we'd still need some kind of a compatibility behavior for
the TLS bit stream emitted by older QEMU versions (which is always
improperly terminated).

Thanks,
