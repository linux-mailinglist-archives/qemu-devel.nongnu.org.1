 Named CPU models generally do not work with KVM.  There are a few cases
 that do work, e.g. using the named CPU model ``cortex-a57`` with KVM on a

-host CPU type has.  And, for this reason, the ``host`` CPU type should

-the ``host`` CPU type, but in the absence of CPU models it's the best we can
