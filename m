Right, I think Peter's comment was more about moving hpet.rs to 
device.rs, and merging PL011's device_class.rs into its device.rs.

I think it's okay to decide that Rust devices will have mini 
directories: it's just the style of the language and Cargo more or less 
relies on having lib.rs.

In a vacuum I would prefer to have hw/char/pl011.rs for what is now 
rust/hw/char/pl011/lib.rs, and place the other files in hw/char/pl011; 
IIRC rustc accepts that style.  However we still rely on Cargo for some 
things(*), and as long as we do there's not much we can do about it.

     (*) notably "cargo fmt".  Everything else is more or less handled
         by Meson starting with 1.8.0.

Peter's comments (especially the second and third) were about two kinds 
of inconsistencies:

1) HPET not using bilge.  This was because Zhao looked at HPET from the 
opposite direction compared to what you did on pl011, namely avoiding 
unsafe and modeling the BQL properly, and sacrificed a bit the usage of 
idiomatic code like what bilge provides.

I think that you made the right choice for the first device and he made 
the right choice for the second device.  But now someone should look at 
HPET and do the work that you did to adopt bilge.

2) The choice between bilge on one side, and bitflags or integers on the 
other.  For pl011 you kept interrupt bits as integers for example, and 
this is related to the topic of (non-)availability of const in traits...

It's not about hot paths, it's more that 1) you cannot use From/Into in 
a "static"'s initializer 2) bilge relies a lot on non-const methods in 
its internal implementation, which makes it quite messy to use it in 
some places.  See for example this thing for which I take all the blame:

     impl Data {
         // bilge is not very const-friendly, unfortunately
         pub const BREAK: Self = Self { value: 1 << 10 };
     }

and the same would be true of interrupt constants and the IRQMASK array.

The separate bilge and bitflags worlds are what bothers me the most in 
the experimental devices.  I can see why they would be very confusing 
for someone who's not had much experience with Rust, and therefore 
doesn't know *why* they are separate.

I agree, and it's why I think you made the right choice using it for 
pl011.  With all the unsafe code that you had to use, strong-typing at 
least showed *something* that Rust could provide compared to C(*).  And 
I like the strong typing too, even if I'm not sure I like bilge's 
*implementation* that much anymore.

I'm not really up for rewriting it, but then I've also done more stupid 
rewrites in the past. :)

    (*) when we were discussing safety vs. unsafety last summer, I may
        have sounded dismissive of this kind of benefit.  My point at the
        time was that unsafe code was so much more complex than C, that
        the benefit of strong-typing wasn't enough to *offset* the
        complexity of unsafe code.  But it is absolutely present.

The repository is private, but I look forward to seeing it!  If you want 
to post an RFC without even any code, just to show what the device code 
looks like, that would be helpful as it will catch stuff like lack of 
type safety.

BTW, if you need it to model reflection better I think it is acceptable 
to assume const_refs_to_static is present.
