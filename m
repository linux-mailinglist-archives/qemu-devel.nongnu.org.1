And people can be free to add new entries later. However, we should 
resist the temptation to add too many details. It should stay simple and 
understandable, even if not all technical nuances are not represented.

 From your comment, it's not clear for me if it's ok as it is, or if you 
want a change.
Can you elaborate on that?

I can remove this word if you think it does not serve any purpose.

It's a good point. I thought the same when I wrote it (and finally chose 
Board). I'll rename it to machine and add the board entry to point to it.

How do you distinguish a SoC and cpu? Is a SoC cpu + devices?
Isn't a board/machine a set of SoC + devices attached?

The definition does not say a board is a SoC, but maybe the wording is 
confusing.

I'm open to a more exact definition. The two terms (drivers and devices) 
seem to overlap on some parts, so I came up with this trivial definition.

Indeed :)
Should we explain what is a computer device?
The goal was just to say that QEMU can emulate hardware interacting with 
the cpu, which could be a possible definition. So people can associate 
that QEMU devices are nothing else than a "normal" computer device.

It's a good point, and a very confusing one.
I'll add it and a link to docs/devel/tcg-ops.rst, that clarifies this 
for TCG.

It's a shortcut, and I'm open to change it. It brings an interesting 
question though.

Technically, QEMU interacts with hypervisor APIs built in various OSes. 
On the other hand, when we use TCG, it's an emulator instead.

But as you can't use KVM/hvf/whpx by itself, how do you name the program 
interacting with it, and emulating the rest of the VM?

The correct word is probably "virtualizer", but from searching on 
Internet, it seems that "vmm" and "virtualizer" are considered the same 
as an "hypervisor". The difference is subtle, and maybe we have an 
opportunity here to clarify it.

I've been confused by that, and just thought it was two different

How would you define patchew?
When we say patchwork, do we implicitely mean patchew?

if I understand currently, patchew is what we want to mention in our 
doc? (and mention it's not associated to patchwork).

This is interesting.

For the majority of developers nowadays, a PR is a GitHub/GitLab PR.
Despite the fact we use the original PR meaning (in git terms), it's 
probably confusing when new comers hear pull request.

Sounds good.

For my personal knowledge: during this work I discovered that we had 
qcow3. From what I understood, it seems to be included in what we called 
qcow2 today. Is that correct?

I had one smile, I'm happy to remove it now :).

More seriously, I can complete after "memory safe by default", "The QEMU 
community is currently working to integrate Rust in the codebase for 
various subsystems".

I can repeat the definition we have there:
"System Emulation provides a virtual model of an entire machine (CPU, 
memory and emulated devices) to run a guest OS. In this mode the CPU may 
be fully emulated, or it may work with a hypervisor such as KVM, Xen or 
Hypervisor.Framework to allow the guest to run directly on the host CPU."

However, I think mentioning softmmu is important, as it's a common 
confusing name (to the new comer) coming from target list.

I'm ok with your definition, TCG is wider than the IR we use.

Thanks for your review Peter!
