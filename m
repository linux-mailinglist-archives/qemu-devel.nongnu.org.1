QEMU comes with a binary so normally there's no reason to compile it for 
most people so I don't think everyone has to fight with it. You're the 
first who complained.

It is based on an old U-Boot version but it needs sam460ex specific 
patches that weren't upstreamed by the vendor of this machine so we have 
to use this old version.

I could push some of the fixes but there's an updated firmware version 
from the vendor since which may be based on a newer U-Boot (still an old 
one from 2015 or before) but has newer version of the sam460ex patches 
that may fix some of the problems. So maybe it's better to look at 
updating to that version. I would not touch it for 9.1 though as the 
current one is at least known to work, so I don't want to break it just 
before the release and also don't have time for it now.
