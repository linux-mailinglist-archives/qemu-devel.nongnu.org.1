Yeah, I can understand that.

The job API at the QMP level has no association with coroutines. It
simply expresses a way to handle long running background jobs in a
standard manner.

The dependency on coroutines is purely the internal job APIs. I wonder
if it is at all practical to alter the job APIs to allow migration to
use them as it exists today, as the migration code already is quite
capable to running in the background, without adding more coroutine
usage.

It would be quite annoying if our general purpose QMP API cannot be
used because internal only impl limitations :-(

With regards,
Daniel
