I guess at the time rsocket is less mature, and less performant
compared to using uverbs directly.

I had a brief check in the rsocket changelog, there seems some
improvement over time,
 might be worth revisiting this. due to socket abstraction, we can't
use some feature like
 ODP, it won't be a small and easy task.
