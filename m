I don't think there is one because the code for PCI multifunction does 
not care ARI. In my opinion, we need yet another check to make 
non-SR-IOV multifunction and ARI capability mutually exclusive; if a 
function has the ARI capability and it is not a VF, an attempt to assign 
non-zero function number for it should fail.

But it should be a distinct check as it will need to check the function 
number bits.

Hello from a guy using a shiny M2 Macbook Air carrying the legacy jack 
with a 100-yen earphone. Even people who ported Linux to this machine 
spent efforts to get the jack to work on Linux ;)
