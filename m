I think a blocker interface where you pass the error to use when the
blocker blocks something is defensible.

Passing an error message or even a text snippet to be interpolated into
the error message would also be defensible.

We're using the former, and it has turned out to be confusing.  Less so
in the block layer, where we sensibly pass Error *.  More so in
migration, where we pass Error **.  Error ** is almost always used to
receive an error, so when we use it for something else, we risk
confusion.

I guess we could have a generic Blocker object instead of using Error
for the purpose.

In addition to an error message, an Error object has an error class
(rarely used remnant of the past), where in the source code the Error
object was created (reported to the user when handling &error_abort),
and an optional hint.  Is any of this useful for blockers?
