Hello Michael,

That's true. To my understanding, to ease the maintenance, Gonglei's
team has taken efforts to refactorize the RDMA migration code by using
rsocket. However, due to a certain limitation in rsocket, it turned
out that only small VM (in terms of core number and memory) can be
migrated successfully. As long as this limitation persists, no
progress can be achieved in this direction. One the other hand, a
proper test environment and integration / regression test cases are
expected to catch any possible regression due to new changes. It seems
that currently, we can go in this direction.

Best regards,
Yu Zhang @ IONOS cloud
