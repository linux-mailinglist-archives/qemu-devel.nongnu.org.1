Thanks both for the inputs so far.

If this might be an issue to them, please share this discussion with them,
and see whether they want to get involved (if that may make their workflow
easier).  In general, whoever still rebases to upstream (even if with low
freq) should always benefit from some involvement upstream to not get
things totally out of control in their production systems.

This is a great question.  We can talk about that when an deprecation
decision will be made.  IMHO you guys know better than me, so suggestions
will be welcomed.

From migration POV, we don't necessary need to remove anything outside
migration; removing COLO inside migration itself will be a great offload of
our maintenance burden on its own.  But I still would definitely like to
sync with other subsystems if we decide that.. let me copy Jason already
just for awareness.  I should have already done that but I forgot, sorry.

Another question to be answered only after we have an initial decision to
keep COLO in this case.  So we can focus on answering the 1st question on
whether we should deprecate COLO.

Thanks,
