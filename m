Yes. Here address_space_get_flatview() is better.

Ah, then rcu just ensures &FlatView is valid since we increments its
ref count during rcu critical section.

But rcu will no longer cover the entire write process!

Combining this RcuGuard proposal in the reply of patch 13:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/aJsX9HH%2FJwblZEYO@intel.com/

impl AddressSpace {
    pub fn get_flatview<'g>(&self, rcu: &'g RcuGuard) -> &'g FlatView {
        let flatp = RcuCell::new(self.deref().current_map);
        unsafe { FlatView::from_raw(flatp.get(rcu).unwrap()) }
    }
}

impl GuestAddressSpace for AddressSpace {
    fn memory(&self) -> Self::T {
        let rcu = RcuGuard::new();
        FlatViewRefGuard::new(self.get_flatview(&rcu)).unwrap()
    }
}

rcu is dropped at the end of memory(). So `&'g RcuGuard` is not enough
for this case.

Sure, and for HPET, the error isn't be handled except panic...

Yes, this is the ideal way. 

This will involve the changes in both vm-memory and QEMU:

* vm-memory: we need to implement AtomicAccess trait for BeNN and LeNN in
  vm-memory (but this is not a big deal).

* For QEMU,

Now to handle AtomicAccess, I've abstracted a uniform C store() binding
in patch 21:

MemTxResult section_rust_store(MemoryRegionSection *section,
                               hwaddr mr_offset, const uint8_t *buf,
                               MemTxAttrs attrs, hwaddr len);

If you haven't looked at this, you can see the comments in:

impl Bytes<MemoryRegionAddress> for MemoryRegionSection {
    fn store<T: AtomicAccess>(
        &self,
        val: T,
        addr: MemoryRegionAddress,
        _order: Ordering,
    ) -> GuestMemoryResult<()> {}
}

section_rust_store() supports target endian by default like
address_space_st(). If we wants to add LE & BE support, I think we have
2 options:
 1) Add another endian argument in section_rust_store, but this also
    requires to pass endian informantion in Bytes trait. Ethier we need to
    implement Bytes<(MemoryRegionAddress, DeviceEndiann)>, or we need to
    add endian info in AtomicAccess.

 2) simplify section_rust_store() further: ignore endian stuff and just
    store the data from *buf to MMIO/ram. For this way, we need to
    adjust adjust_endianness() to do nothing:
    section_rust_store()
     -> memory_region_dispatch_write()
      -> adjust_endianness()

    However, adjust_endianness() is still very useful, especially for
    QEMU, the caller of store() doesn't know the access is for MMIO or
    RAM.

So I prefer 1) for now, and maybe it's better to add endian info in
AtomicAccess.

Yes, this way is similar with my previous attempt...but I don't know
what's the best to handler LE/BE, so this RFC just omitted these cases,
and chose a simplest case - native endian.

It seems QEMU's interfaces don't use *host* endianness?

I'm referring address_space_ld*() & address_space_st*(), and their doc
said:

/* address_space_ld*: load from an address space
 * address_space_st*: store to an address space
 *
 * These functions perform a load or store of the byte, word,
 * longword or quad to the specified address within the AddressSpace.
 * The _le suffixed functions treat the data as little endian;
 * _be indicates big endian; no suffix indicates "same endianness
 * as guest CPU".
 *
 * The "guest CPU endianness" accessors are deprecated for use outside
 * target-* code; devices should be CPU-agnostic and use either the LE
 * or the BE accessors.
 */

I also considerred host endianness. But host endianness doesn't align
with C side... C side only supports little/big/native (target/guest)
endianness.

So, do you think Rust side should consider host endianness? Or maybe
we can add DEVICE_HOST_ENDIAN in device_endian. But is there the way to
check what the specific endianness of Host is?

Thanks,
Zhao
