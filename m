A fail would be expected everytime something changes:
- it can be a default field that has a new value (particularly sensitive 
for cpus)
- it can be a new cpu field that is added
- it can be a board definition change
- it can be a hardware related change

In all cases, even though it does not break migration, it's interesting 
to know such a change happen.
As well, if it's simple to update and get differences of the various 
dumps per {binary, board}, then it's trivial to identify and comment the 
"false positive". The more often it runs (ideally, per PR, or per 
series), the easier it is to identify what changed.

Glad to hear we have a script, but sad to hear "will run manually once 
every 6 months".

Would that be possible to post this on an online forge like GitLab, and 
commit the previous and new versions of dumps (the data, not the list of 
failures), so we can see all the differences in a nice way?

It would not cover 100%, but if we already make sure that a VM stopped 
at end of qemu_init() has a predictable dump, it's already a huge win 
over having nothing.
We can use the same argument that current QEMU CI does not cover 100% of 
the code (*much* less than that from what I tried), but it's still 
better than no test.
