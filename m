As long as the target QEMU CPUs have NOT started running, then
no I/O writes should have been sent to the storage, so the storage
should still be in a consistent state, and thus we can still try
to fail back to the source QEMU.

The "fun" problem here is that just because we /try/ to fail back
to the source QEMU, does not imply the source QEMU will now succeed
in re-acquiring the locks it just released a short time ago.

Consider the classic dead NFS server problem. The target may have
acquired 1 lock and failed on another lock because of a service
interruption to the NFS server. Well the target can't neccessarily
release the lock that it did successfully acquire now. So if we
fail back to the source, it'll be unable to reacquire the lock as
the target still holds it.

This doesn't mean we shouldn't try to fail back, but there will
always be some failures scenarios we'll struggle to recover from.

The "migration paused" state is our last chance, as that leaves
both QEMU's present while the admin tries to fix the underlying
problems.

With regards,
Daniel
