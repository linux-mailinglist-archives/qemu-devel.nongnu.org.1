It's been a while, but I think I may have meant an AIO_WAIT_WHILE() that
is executed by someone else and that depends on the coroutine. For
example, I imagine this is what I could have seen:

1. The QMP command handler does some I/O and yields for it (like
   updating the qcow2 header for block_resize) with increased
   bs->in_flight

2. Something else calls drain, which polls qemu_aio_context, but not
   iohandler_ctx, until the request completes.

3. Nothing will ever resume the coroutine -> deadlock

Non-coroutine handlers could probably stay in iothread_ctx, but I don't
think we can avoid switching to a different for coroutine handlers.

So maybe we can just move the rescheduling down to the coroutine case in
qmp_dispatch().
