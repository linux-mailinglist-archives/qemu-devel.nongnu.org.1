Presumably we can tie it to '-cpu host' without much problem, and
then just leave it as an opt-in feature flag for named CPU models.

FYI currently it is proposed to unconditionally force set legacy-vm-type=true
in libvirt, so QEMU guests would *never* use the new ioctl, to fix what we
consider to be a QEMU / kernel guest ABI regression.

If libvirt adds this though, it is basically a forever setting we would
never be able to remove as removing would break ABI compat again.

  https://lists.libvirt.org/archives/list/devel@lists.libvirt.org/message/KP24LPFV4OCMN45TDHNXQVBPDZ56QSRR/

I'd much rather QEMU did NOT set this by default in its machine types,
so libvirt doesn't have to add this forced flag. That way downstream
distros who /can/ guarantee new enough kernels, can still use
legacy-vm-type=false in their downstream machine types, without
libvirt overriding this.

With regards,
Daniel
