Initially, when I proposed the split approach, it wasn't about
splitting for the sake of splitting, nor for the sake of "work".

A more granular split is just a means, and the goal is to place things
at different stages in the most appropriate locations.

I believe that's how things should be. instance_post_init() provides an
opportunity to tweak properties. The order of instance_post_init()
reflects the dependency relationships for property adjustments. As I
mentioned earlier, if a property doesn't need to consider other factors
and is simply being initialized, instance_init() is the most appropriate
place for it.

Breaking global properties is just one example. Essentially, properties
like "vendor" don't adhere well to the semantics of QOM.

IMO, it's not the split that makes things worse, but rather the improper
use of instance_post_init() that makes everything about the x86 CPU
fragile. Ideally, QOM/qdev should focus on their own abstraction order,
while the leaf-class should do the right thing in the right place, which
is the most solid situation.
