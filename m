Hi Klaus, All,

I was looking at what dependencies I'm carrying on my CXL tree and this
series is one of the bigger bits :(

Any plans to take it forwards?
I have some other stuff to solve to have a fully upstream QEMU
solution for the CXL fm-api over mctp (direct from host anyway), but
if this is blocked indefinitely tackling how to get a controller onto
a typical server system isn't going to be productive :(

As Davidlohr called out at in the CXL LPC Uconf [1] this is really handy
for testing his work on libcxlmi. A number of people are looking
at more sophisticated CXL fabric emulation and that will also need
us to close this gap!

No promises but maybe we can find someone to help with adding tests
if that's the only remaining blocker.
