Great! Sorry for the slow response, I just saw this comment. I'm looking
forward to your work on this!

Thank you!

I like this idea. Clear splitting helps to standardize the usage of
BqlCell, preventing both underuse and overuse.

Yes, it was based on old code base...and it seems outdated.

Thank you, it looks better and overcomes the drawback of the original
proposal.

Based your and Richard's suggestion, modifying memattrs avoids
introducing additional library. :-)

I think it could work, and this time it won't be needed, based on your
newer suggestion. :-)

Sure. I see.

Thank you!
