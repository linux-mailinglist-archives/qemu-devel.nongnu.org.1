Now assigned CVE-2024-7409; I'll make sure that is mentioned in the
commit message, whether a v2 is needed or whether this gets a positive
review as-is modulo the reference.

I have not (yet?) determined how long the bug has existed, but note
that the code in question appears unchanged since at least qemu 6.0
(from 2021), and probably predates that, so it is long-standing.
