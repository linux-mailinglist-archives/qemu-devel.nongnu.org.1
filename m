Hold on a bit.. there're two things I want to clarity with you.

Firstly, qemu_put_byte() has buffering on f->buf[].  Directly changing them
to iochannels may regress performance.  I never checked, but I would assume
some buffering will be needed for small chunk of data even with iochannels.

Secondly, why multifd has things to do with this?  What you're talking
about is more like the rework of qemufile->iochannel thing to me, and IIUC
that doesn't yet involve multifd.  For many of such conversions, it'll
still be operating on the main channel, which is not the multifd channels.
What matters might be about what's in your mind to be put over multifd
channels there.

Hmm.... yes we can. But what do we gain from it, if we know it'll be a few
MBs in total?  There ain't a lot of huge stuff to move, it seems to me.

That's exactly what I want to avoid.  Not all things will need a thread,
only performance relevant ones.

So now we have multifd threads, they're for IO throughputs: if we want to
push a fast NIC, that's the only way to go.  Anything wants to push that
NIC, should use multifd.

Then it turns out we want more concurrency, it's about VFIO save()/load()
of the kenrel drivers and it can block.  Same to other devices that can
take time to save()/load() if it can happen concurrently in the future.  I
think that's the reason why I suggested the VFIO solution to provide a
generic concept of thread pool so it services a generic purpose, and can be
reused in the future.

I hope that'll stop anyone else on migration to create yet another thread
randomly, and I definitely don't like that either.  I would _suspect_ the
next one to come as such is TDX.. I remember at least in the very initial
proposal years ago, TDX migration involves its own "channel" to migrate,
migration.c may not even know where is that channel.  We'll see.

The client puts something into a buffer (SendData), then it delivers it to
multifd (who silently switches the buffer).  After enqueued, the client
assumes the buffer is sent and reusable again.

It looks pretty common to me, what is the concern within the procedure?
What's the "holding of client data" issue?

I don't know.. they look similar to me yet so far, as long as multifd is
managing the N buffers, while the clients will manage one for each.  There
should have a helper to allocate/free the generic multifd buffers (SendData
in this case) so everyone should be using that.

I think Maciej is working on this too since your absence, as I saw he
decided to base his work on top of yours and he's preparing the new
version. I hope you two won't conflict or duplicates the work.  Might be
good to ask / wait and see how far Maciej has been going.
