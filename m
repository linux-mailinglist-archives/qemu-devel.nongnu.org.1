Yeah, I can understand if IGVM scope should be limited to just memory
and CPU setup.

If we use the firmeware descriptor files, we could define capabilities
in that to express a need for a particular type of persistent storage
to back the vTPM. So having this info in IGVM files isn't critical.

If the IGVM format is flexible enough that it could be used for any VM
type, even non-confidential VMs, then having its config be separate from
ConfidentialGuestSUpport would make sense. If it is fundamentally tied
to CVMs, then just a property is fine I guess.

Probably best to stay away from -bios, to avoid overloading new semantics
onto a long standing argument.
