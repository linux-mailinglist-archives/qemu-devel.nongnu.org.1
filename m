Hi Ani,

Right, I understand that the state before and after reset will have
different launch measurements, that is expected when booting with a
different firmware :)

The devil lies in "same order of setup calls". Without a way to define
this order through the vmfwupdate interface there is a lot of implicit
knowledge required about how KVM/QEMU setup the TEE context to calculate
the expected after-reset launch measurement. Even worse, the exact way
this setup is done then becomes ABI, because any change in this process
will lead to a different launch measurement.

Some examples of initial memory layout calls which influence the launch
measurment:

	1) Launch VMSA(s) (SEV-SNP only, though I believe on TDX the
	   initial register state can also be changed to some
	   degree).
	2) Pre-Validated/Accepted memory regions (TDX and SEV-SNP). This
	   is especially important, as different FWs have different
	   requirements on what memory is pre-validated, zeroed, etc.
	3) Zero-pages, measured and unmeasured (TDX and SEV-SNP).
	4) Position of the CPUID page, secrets page, and id-blob
	   (SEV-SNP).
	5) Pre-populated data (TDX and SEV-SNP).

If I understand the vmfwupdate interface correctly, and please let me
know if I am wrong here, it only allows to specify a call for part 5) of
the above list. Some of the other parts can be specified in architecture
dependent ways in the FW image itself, but not all of them.

So the question is, is the plan to hardcode everything else (including
the order of calls) and make the behavior ABI?

Regards,

	Joerg
