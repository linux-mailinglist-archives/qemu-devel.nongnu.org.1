Right, I guess that's my question -- is "WAKEUP" ever any
different from "WARM" reset? I think the latter is a more
common general concept.

On the other hand it looks like we already have the
concept in the runstate state machine of
RUN_STATE_SUSPENDED versus RUN_STATE_RUNNING, and so if we
define "WAKEUP" as "goes from SUSPENDED to RUNNING" that's
quite a clearly defined condition. Whereas WARM reset would
be a much wider range of things and ought to include for
instance "guest triggers a reset by writing to port 92"
and all the other SHUTDOWN_CAUSE_GUEST_RESET cases.
(Side note: do we document all these runstates and transitions
anywhere?)

For virtio-mem, on a guest-triggered reset, should it
(a) definitely not unplug all the hotplugged memory
(b) definitely unplug all the hotplugged memory
(c) we don't care?

If (a) then that seems to push towards calling all these
cases of a "warm" reset; if (b) then that would be a
reason to make "warm" and "wakeup" different.

thanks
