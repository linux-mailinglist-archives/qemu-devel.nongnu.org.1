ok, I see. This looks fragile though, I/one will need to do a more
thorough review.

Whether we talk about multiplexing front-end or back-end, the issues
are similar. In general, mixing input will create issues. Teeing
output is less problematic, except to handle the buffering...

I think it would be saner to have the muxer be selectors: only work
with one selected be or fe. Otherwise, we can run into various issues.

I hope some qemu maintainers can comment too.
