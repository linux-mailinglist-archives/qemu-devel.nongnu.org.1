In the qemu impl, INMIGRATE is, imho, more equiv of PAUSED - do_vm_stop()
mostly ignores every state except RUNNING (putting bdrv operations aside).
IOW, anything besides "running" is treated as "not running".

But then Paolo fixed that in 1e9981465f ("qmp: handle stop/cont in
INMIGRATE state"), wiring that to autostart.

Now we seem to find that "suspended" should actually fall within (where
"vm" is running, but "vcpu" is not), and it seems we should treat "vm" and
"vcpu" differently.

I think we must stop the "vm", not only the "vcpu".  I discussed this bit
in the other thread more or less: it's because qemu_system_wakeup_request()
can be called in many places, e.g. acpi_pm_tmr_timer().

It means even after the VM is "stop"ped by the admin QMP (where qmp_stop()
ignores SUSPENDED, keep the "vm" running), it can silently got waken up
without admin even noticing it.  I'm not sure what Libvirt will behave if
it suddenly receives a QAPI_EVENT_WAKEUP randomly after a "stop".

Right, that's why I think we at least need one more boolean to remember the
suspended state, then when we switch from any STOP states into any RUN
states, we know where to go.  Here STOP states I meant anything except
RUNNING and SUSPENDED, while RUN -> RUNNING or SUSPENDED.

"stop" was since qemu v0.14, so I guess we can't blame the missing of
details or any form of inaccuracy..  Obviously we do more than "stop vCPU
executions" in the current implementation.

But after we reach a consensus on how we should fix the current suspended
problem, we may want to update the documentation to start containing more
information.

IMO compatibility is only necessary if at least the existing code is
running well.  But now I see it a major flaw in suspended state and I can't
see how it can go right if with current code base..  My concern is instead
that after suspended will be used more (e.g., assuming CPR will rely on it)
we can have more chance to confuse/oops a mgmt app like Libvirt, like I
described above.

In summary, I think a current solution to me is only to fix at least
suspended state for good, by:

  - adding vm_suspended boolean to remember machine RUNNING / SUSPENDED
    state.  When "cont" we need to switch to either RUNNING / SUSPENDED
    depending on the boolean.

  - keeping SUSPENDED state as RunState (for compatibility, otherwise we'll
    need another interface to fetch that boolean anyway), even though not
    query-able during any !RUNNING && !SUSPENDED state.. hopefully not a
    big deal

  - enrich ducumentation of qmp_stop/qmp_cont to describe what they really do

  - (with suspended working all right...) fix migration of SUSPENDED state

I don't expect a lot of code changes is needed, maybe even less than the
current series (because we don't need special knob to differenciate
migration or non-migration callers of do_vm_stop()). IMHO this series is
already doing some of that but just decided to ignore outside-migration
states for suspeneded.

We may want to add some test cases though to verify the suspended state
transitions (maybe easier to put into migration-test with the new ACPI
guest code), but optional.

Thanks,
