We need to fetch the max size we need and allocate one object covers all
the sizes we need.  I sincerely don't understand why it's an issue..

So even if there can be multiple pointers we can definitely play the same
trick that we allocate object A+B+C+D in the same chunk and let A->b points
to B, A->c points to C, and so on.

Before that, my question is do we really need that.

For device states, AFAIU it'll always be an opaque buffer..  VFIO needs
that, vDPA probably the same, and for VMSDs it'll be a temp buffer to put
the VMSD dump.

For multifd, I used offset[0] just to make sure things like "dynamic sized
multifd buffers" will easily work without much changes.  Or even we could
have this, afaict:

#define MULTIFD_PAGES_PER_PACKET (128)

typedef struct {
    /* number of used pages */
    uint32_t num;
    /* number of normal pages */
    uint32_t normal_num;
    /* number of allocated pages */
    uint32_t allocated;
    RAMBlock *block;
    /* offset of each page */
    ram_addr_t offset[MULTIFD_PAGES_PER_PACKET];
} MultiFDPages_t;

It might change perf on a few archs where psize is not 4K, but I don't see
it a huge deal, personally.

Then everything will have no pointers, and it can be even slightly faster
because we use 64B cachelines in most systems nowadays, and one indirect
pointer may always need a load on a new cacheline otherwise..

This whole cacheline thing is trivial.  What I worried that you worry too
much on that flexibility that we may never need.

And even with that flexibilty I don't understand why you don't like
allocating an object that's larger than how the union is defined: I really
don't see it a problem..  It'll need care on alloc/free, true, but it
should be pretty manageable in this case to me.

Maybe I meant "2 types of clients"?  VDPA will also use the same device
state buffer.

IMHO it's also easier to understand, where any user always has a free
SendData buffer to manipulate, and multifd always has one buffer for each
channel (free or busy).  That is compared to each client needs to allocate
N buffers and we're actually at least leaking "number of multifd channels"
into the client which may not be wanted.

IOW, I wonder whether you're happy with below to drop the union idea:

     struct MultiFDSendData {
         MultiFDPayloadType type;
         MultiFDPages_t ram_payload;
         MultiFDDeviceState_t device_payload;
     };

Then we keep the "(M+N)" usage model, but don't use union and simply forget
about the memory consumption (similar to your original memory consumption
with this, but will be better as long as anything else joins, e.g. vDPA,
because then vDPA will at least share that same buffer with VFIO).

Do you think you would accept this?

I'm not familiar with flexible array.  What's the difference between:

struct {
    int a[];
};

v.s.

struct {
    int a[0];
};

?

If that works for you, it should work for me.

Or if you really hate the union / zero-sized array thing, it'll still be
nice to me to drop the union but keep using M+N objects model.

Thanks.
