Any MMIO access has to come via the slow path. Any MMIO also currently
has to be the last instruction in a block in case the operation triggers
a change in the translation regime that needs to be picked up by the
next instruction you execute.

This is a pathological case when modelling VRAM on a device because its
going to be slow either way. At least if you model the multiple byte
access with a helper you can amortise some of the cost of the MMU lookup
with a single probe_() call.=20

They don't - what we need is to have a RAM-like-device model for QEMU
where we can relax the translation rules because we know we are writing
to RAM like things that don't have registers or other state changing
behaviour.

The poor behaviour is because QEMU currently treats all MMIO as
potentially system state altering where as for VRAM it doesn't need to.

I don't know about vfio-pci but blob resources mapped via virtio-gpu
just appear as chunks of RAM to the guest - hence no trapping.

We can't have heuristics when we must prioritise correctness. However we
could expand the device model to make the exact behaviour of different
devices clear and optimise when we know it is safe.=20
