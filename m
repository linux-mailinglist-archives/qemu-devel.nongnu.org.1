Can you provide some example memory leaks that can reproduce on current
master branch with (2) and (3)?  How severe are they?

I plan to merge the one-patch fix first on circular ref.  This issue has
been dangling for too long, and I highly doubt anyone would even start to
like patch 1 of your this series on "finalizing" stage.

I don't see why we need to be blocked forever on this, keeping PeterM and
others poking the known issues.  It'll be great if you can work whatever on
top of that, and justifying whatever you propose is better is also easier.

Is that OK for you?

I actually didn't notice we don't have much users.  I think it'll block new
users, then, by making free() not usable anymore.  Not to mention it's also
definitely an abuse to reuse a free() for other things.

It can be relevant to the other email discussion too:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/aMHidDl1tdx-2G4e@x1.local/

I feel like object_new(TYPE_MEMORY_REGION) can be a good thing to simplify
allocated MRs whose lifecycle still is the same as the device for the long
term.

Some memory APIs will need touch up, but it shouldn't be much, basically we
want to skip object_initialize() for all memory_region_init_*() APIs on top
of object_new(TYPE_MEMORY_REGION) MRs.

I'm also not eager to change anything yet, because these MRs are minority,
and I don't immediately have a problem to solve myself here.  So I would
like to know what exactly problem you're hitting with (2)/(3) above.

Thanks,
