docs/about/build-platforms.rst already defines supported platforms. One 
of the supported platforms is Debian 11 (bullseye), and it carries Linux 
5.10, which was released December 2020. If we follow this platform 
support, a new feature added to upstream Linux may take about 4 years 
before it gets enabled by default on QEMU.

As an upstream developer, I feel it is too long, but I'm sure there are 
different opinions from different perspectives.
