that's what I was saying.
HEST table should be in DSDT, but it's optional and one has to use
'ras=on' option to enable that, which we aren't doing ATM.
So whatever changes are happening we aren't seeing them in tests
nor will we see any regression for the same reason.

While white listing tables before change should happen and then updating them
is the right thing to do, it's not sufficient since none of tests
run with 'ras' enabled, hence code is not actually executed.

I'd skip hardware_errors/CPER testing from QEMU unit tests.
That's basically requires functioning 'APEI driver' to test that.

Maybe we can use Ani's framework to parse HEST and all the way
towards CPER record(s) traversal, but that's certainly out of
scope of this series.
It could be done on top, but I won't insist even on that
since Mauro's out of tree error injection testing will
cover that using actual guest (which I assume he would
like to run periodically).
