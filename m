It would be very unintuitive if ref counts not counted the number of 
references to the object that contains this ref count. If I understood 
correctly that's the reason for this discussion that in this case the ref 
count of the owner is counting the MRs instead of its own references and 
the MR's ref count is not used which is confusing.

If looking for rules to follow one proven and relatively simple set is 
what Cocoa uses on macOS. There's a very short introduction here:
https://www.peachpit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=377302&seqNum=2
and a bit longer more complete here:
https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/cocoa/an-in-depth-look-at-manual-memory-management-in-objective-c/

I think this case is one which is shortly mentioned at the end of the 
second link which is solved by not retaining the contained objects so this 
is closer to what PeterX suggests just dropping the refcounting on the 
owner and consider the MRs owned by the superregions once added there. 
This means add subregion would pass the reference to the owner and remove 
subregion passes it back to who called it so the MR's ref count needs no 
change but then who added the MR should not use it after passing it to the 
superregion and who called remove subregion should release it. But I don't 
really understans the problem so maybe it's more complex.
