I started giving this a try, but quickly ran into some issues/questions:

1. For global state code, is it preferred to use
GRAPH_RDLOCK_GUARD_MAINLOOP() to cover the whole function or better to
use bdrv_graph_rd(un)lock_main_loop() to keep the locked section as
small as necessary? I feel like the former can be more readable, e.g. in
blk_insert_bs(), blk_new_open(), where blk->root is used in conditionals.

2. In particular, protecting blk->root means that blk_bs() needs to have
the read lock. In fact, blk_bs() is reading blk->root twice in a row, so
it seems like it could suffer from a potential NULL pointer dereference
(or I guess after compiler optimization a potential use-after-free)?

Since blk_bs() is IO_CODE() and not a coroutine, I tried to mark it
GRAPH_RDLOCK and move on to the callers.

However, one caller is blk_nb_sectors() which itself is called by
blk_get_geometry(). Both of these are manually-written coroutine wrappers:

Both the blk_bs() and blk_nb_sectors() functions are IO_CODE(), but not
coroutines, and callers of blk_get_geometry are already in the device
code. I'm not sure how to proceed here, happy to hear suggestions :)

Oh I see, good catch!
