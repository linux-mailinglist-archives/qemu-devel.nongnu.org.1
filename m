Right, but note that when I was thinking of a comparison between cpr-exec
v.s. normal migration, I didn't mean a "normal live migration".  I think
it's more of the case whether exec() can be avoided.  I had a feeling that
this exec() will cause a major part of work elsewhere but maybe I am wrong
as I didn't see the whole branch.

AFAIU, "cpr-exec takes 0.1 secs" is a conditional result.  I think it at
least should be relevant to what devices are attached to the VM, right?

E.g., I observed at least two things that can drastically enlarge the
blackout window:

  1) vcpu save/load sometimes can take ridiculously long time, even if 99%
  of them are fine.  I still didn't spend time looking at this issue, but
  the outlier (of a single cpu save/load, while I don't remember whether
  it's save or load, both will contribute to the downtime anyway) can cause
  100+ms already for that single vcpu.  It'll already get more than 0.1sec.

  2) virtio device loads can be sometimes very slow due to virtqueue
  manipulations.  We used to have developers working in this area,
  e.g. this thread:

  https://lore.kernel.org/r/20230317081904.24389-1-xuchuangxclwt@bytedance.com

  I don't yet have time to further look.  Since you mentioned vhost I was
  wondering whether you hit similar issues, and if not why yet.  IIRC it
  was only during VM loads so dest QEMU only.  Again that'll contribute to
  the overall downtime too and that can also be 100ms or more, but that may
  depend on VM memory topology and device setup.

When we compare the solutions, we definitely don't need to make it "live":
it could be a migration starting with VM paused already, skipping all dirty
tracking just like cpr-reboot, but in this case it's can be a relatively
normal migration, so that we still invoke the new qemu binary and load that
on the fly, perhaps taking the fds via scm rights.  Then compare these two
solutions with/without exec().  Note that I'm not requesting for such data;
it's not fair if that takes a lot of work already first to implement such
idea, but what I wanted to say is that it might be interesting to first
analyze what caused the downtime, and whether that can be logically
resolved too without exec(); hence the below question on "why exec()" in
the first place, as I still feel like that's somewhere we should avoid
unless extremely necessary..

I see.  However this is a common issue to migration, am I right?  I mean,
if we have some chardevs on src host, then we migrate the VM from src to
dst, then a reconnect will be needed anyway.  It looks to me that as long
as the old live migration is supported, there's already a solution and apps
are ok with reconnecting to the new ports.  From that POV, I am curious
whether this can be seen as a (kind of separate) work besides the cpr-exec,
however perhaps only a new feature only be valid for cpr-exec?

Meanwhile, is there some elaborations on what would be the major change of
nicer user experience with the new solution?

That sounds like a better thing to me, so that live migration framework is
not changed as drastic.  I just still feel like exec() is too powerful, and
evil can reside, just like black magic in the fairy tales; magicians try to
avoid using it unless extremely necessary.

I think the next step for my review is to understand what is implied with
exec().  I'll wait for you to push your tree somewhere so maybe I can read
that and understand better.  A base commit would work too if you can share
so I can apply the series, as it doesn't seem to apply to master now.

Thanks,
