If the "split-accel" (HW virtualization + SW emulation) effort lands,
we'll have a case of HVF + TCG. Do we want to consider it within our
security support policy? I doubt it (at least at the beginning). However
that would match "use a virtualization accelerator like KVM or HVF" (AND
"use one of the machine types listed below" with the 'virt' machine).

Should we reword? Or explicit "Any SW emulation use case is NOT
covered"?
