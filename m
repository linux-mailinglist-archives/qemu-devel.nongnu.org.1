I grabbed more traces (by -trace "*" to cover as many events as possible
) and have a couple observations:

* It's not an issue with kvm's ioctl, and that qemu_mutex_lock/
  object_dynamic_cast_assert accounted for the vast majority of all
  exception timestamps.
* The total exception timestamp occurrence probability was roughly 0.013%
  (608 / 4,616,938) in a 398M trace file.
* And the intervals between the "wrong" timestamp and its pre event are
  almost all within 50ns, even more concentrated within 20ns (there are
  even quite a few 1~10ns).

Just a guess:

Would it be possible that a trace event which is too short of an interval,
and happen to meet a delay in signaling to send to writeout_thread?

It seems that this short interval like a lack of real-time guarantees in
the underlying mechanism...

If it's QEMU's own issue, I feel like the intervals should be randomized,
not just within 50ns...

May I ask what you think? Any suggestions for researching this situation
;-)

Thanks,
Zhao
