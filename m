I see, thanks for explaining.  Yes that sounds better to me.  Re the
ugliness: is that about a pre_save() plus one extra uint64_t field?  In
that case it looks better comparing to migrating "void*".

I'm trying to read some context on the vaddr remap thing from you, and I
found this:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/Y90bvBnrvRAcEQ%2F%2F@nvidia.com/

So it will work with iommufd now?  Meanwhile, what's the status for mdev?
Looks like it isn't supported yet for both.

Thanks,
