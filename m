The current approach is to adjust the policy and to spell out the machines where these commitments are made.

I don't think that its desirable to rebase on top of that series,
as it is liable to unduly delay Bernhard's work.

With a very minimal wording tweak our current defined policy could
avoid being a blocker for enabling KVM in imx8mp-evk. In

  https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/security.html

where it describes the "virtualization use case", we could simply
tweak it to always require a versioned machine type

Change

  "These use cases rely on hardware virtualization extensions
   to execute guest code safely on the physical CPU at close-
   to-native speed."

To say

  "These use cases apply to versioned machine types when used
   in combination with hardware virtualization extensions
   to execute guest code safely on the physical CPU at close-
   to-native speed"

Since imx8mp-evk won't be a versioned machine type, it is thus
trivially excluded, without us having to enumerate all machine
types int he docs.


With regards,
Daniel
