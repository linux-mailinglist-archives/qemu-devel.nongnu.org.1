Wandering in here from the still-very-much-in-progress Arm perspective
(current but not yet posted QEMU code at
https://gitlab.com/cohuck/qemu/-/tree/arm-cpu-model-rfcv3?ref_type=3Dheads):

We're currently operating at the "writable ID register fields" level
with the idea of providing features (FEAT_xxx) as an extra layer on top
(as they model a subset of what we actually need) and have yet to come
up with a good way to do named models for KVM. The
query-cpu-model-expansion command will yield a list of all writable ID
register fields and their values (as for now, for the 'host' model.) IIUC
you want to query (a) what is actually available for configuration
(before starting a domain) and (b) what you actually got (when starting
a domain). Would a dump of the current state of the ID register fields
before starting the vcpus work for (b)? Or is that too different from
what other archs need/want? How much wriggle room do we have for special
handling (different commands, different output, ...?)
