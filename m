My request was to not make the output much wider than it is now as that 
would result in broken lines and less readable output. The comment was not 
about parsing output but keeping the result fit in not too wide terminals 
as 64 bit addresses makes it wide already. Thus replacing spaces with tree 
chars is OK with me as long as no new vertical space is added. The first 
version of patch increased vertical space. Using ASCII chars was request 
from somebody else but that makes the output look less nice so I'm not 
sure it worth the change with that. Maybe leaving current output then 
adding a separate tree mode with the original line drawing chars could 
satisfy all preferences.

BALATON Zoltan
