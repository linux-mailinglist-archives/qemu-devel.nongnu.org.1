(edited cc list since it's moved away from a discussion of this
particular patch and on to a testing/ci coverage issue)

I think that these are mostly testing different target
architectures, e.g. functional-system-alpine tests what
build-system-alpine built, which covers avr, loongarch64,
mips64 and mipsel targets; functional-system-ubuntu
tests what build-system-ubuntu bulit, which is alpha,
microblazeel, mips64el, and so on. So there is less overlap
than it might appear.

(Some of them complete pretty quickly because we have very few
functional tests for some archs; some are slower where we're
running more tests. e.g.
https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/jobs/9213571833
is functional-system-fedora completing in 7 mins because we
only have a few ppc tests, but this is functional-system-opensuse
https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/jobs/9213571852
taking 27 mins because it's testing x86 and aarch64. The
corresponding build jobs take about 30 mins each.)

You'd need to have a duplicate of all of the above
functional-system-* test jobs if you wanted
to test all the guest architectures, I think. So it's
30 mins build * six configs plus 60 mins total for testing.
Or we could convert (some of?) the existing jobs to use the
sanitisers if we needed to economise on CI time.

You could make an argument that it's the other way around:
from the project's point of view engineer minutes are cheap
because we never pay engineers, whereas CI minutes are
expensive because we must pay for them out of our project
donations :-)
