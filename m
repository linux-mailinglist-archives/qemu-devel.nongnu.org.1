I think for backwards-compatibility reasons we should stick
with the current cpsr format for the information that is in it.
We do at least define the fields so you get a nice view of it:

(gdb) print $cpsr
$4 = [ EL=0 BTYPE=0 Z ]

kgdb currently does the same thing we do, and exposes a 32-bit
"cpsr" value.
