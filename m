OK. I realize I'm not consistent in this patch either, but I'll explain
that my using double quotes here is a black-ism that is sneaking in the
more I use it to auto-format my patches :)

Maybe time for a flag day when I move scripts/qapi to python/qemu/qapi ...

(Sorry, this type of stuff is ... invisible to me, and I really do rely on
the linters to make sure I don't do this kind of thing.)

It inserts after any intro-paragraph or member section it finds, but before
any tagged, feature, or outro-paragraph it finds.

The loop breaks on the very first instance of tagged/feature/outro, exiting
immediately and leaving the insertion index set to the first occurrence of
such a section, so that the insertion will place the member documentation
prior to that section.

The loop doesn't break when it finds intro-paragraph or members, so it'll
continue to tick upwards until it reaches the end of the list or it finds
something disqualifying.

Wellp, yeah. That's certainly less code :)

I tossed in your algorithm alongside mine and asserted they were always
equal, and they are, so... yup. I think the only possible concern here is
if there is precisely one and only one section and 1 is beyond EOL, but
that's easy to fix. It apparently doesn't happen in practice, but I can't
presently imagine why it *couldn't* happen.

I'll just write a comment explaining the assumptions that make your algo
work (intro section always guaranteed even if empty; intro sections always
collapse into one section, members must start at i:=3D1 if they exist at al=
l,
members must be contiguous.)

Now, for a critique of my own patch: this patch makes it difficult to audit
all of the cases where intro vs outro paragraphs sections may be ambiguous
because we automatically add members sections, so the warning yap I add
later on catches less cases.

It's possible we may want to add a warning yap about paragraph ambiguity
directly to the parser, OR just decide we don't really care and we just
*assume* and that it's fine.

We can discuss this pointedly on a call next time, and I'll come prepared
with examples and line numbers.... Or, if you'd prefer, you can get a
written report so you can take your time reading in silence.

<br>
If we have some member documentation, the member doc stubs clearly must<br>
go there.=C2=A0 Inserting them at the end makes sense.<br>
<br>
Else we want to put them where the parser would accept real member<br>
documentation.<br>
<br>
&quot;The parser&quot; is .get_doc().=C2=A0 This is what it accepts (I&#39;=
m prepared to<br>
explain this in detail if necessary):<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 One untagged section<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Member documentation, if any<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Zero ore more tagged or untagged sections<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Feature documentation, if any<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Zero or more tagged or untagged sections<br>
<br>
If we there is no member documentation, this is<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 One untagged section<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Zero ore more tagged or untagged sections<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Feature documentation, if any<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Zero or more tagged or untagged sections<br>
<br>
Note that we cannot have two adjacent untagged sections (we only create<br>
one if the current section isn&#39;t untagged; if it is, we extend it<br>
instead).=C2=A0 Thus, the second section must be tagged or feature<br>
documentation.<br>
<br>
Therefore, the member doc stubs must go right after the first section.<br>
<br>
This is also where qapidoc.py inserts member documentation.<br>
