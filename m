Yeah, thing is how we define 'useful for users'. If you take a look at this
thread where we discussed the 'max' CPU design:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-riscv/35a847a1-2720-14ab-61b0-c72d77d5f43b@ventanamicro.com/

The 'max' CPU design is rather straightforward, the profile support is also
straightforward (I'll work on that soon), but the role of the rv64 CPU is
confusing.

IMO we should freeze the current rv64 extensions, document it, and the leave
it alone unless we have a very good reason to enable more stuff. We'll have the
max CPU for the use case where users want the maximum amount of stable features
and, with profile support, we can make rv64 operate with a predictable set of
extensions. Seems like a good coverage.


Thanks,

Daniel
