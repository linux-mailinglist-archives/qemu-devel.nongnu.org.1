Unfortunately I am totally new to submitting patches for QEMU and have
no connection with AMD so I can't speak about Vikram's situation. I
agree though, at the very least something needs to change in the
MAINTAINERS file. Maybe Francisco knows more?

I'm very, very new to QEMU development so I think I would be a poor fit
as a maintainer, at least right now. I'm also not affiliated with any
big money companies. I can completely understand that the subsystem
needs an additional maintainer though. That's a lot on one person's
shoulders!

Thank you for reviewing all of my patches, Francisco.

Now, all of these patches are reviewed but there are a few other issues
we talked about here (dlc2len/len2dlc and issues with the flags), and I
also found a FIFO issue. Would it make the most sense for me to submit a
V2 of this series with a few extra patches tacked on the end, or should
I wait for this series to be applied first? I can do it either way, I
just wasn't sure what would be preferred.

Thanks,
Doug
