I don't mind setting new defaults in rv64.

Save a few exceptions, all the extensions declared in riscv_cpu_extensions[]
will be enabled in the 'max' CPU, regardless of their default value for the
rv64 CPU (see riscv_init_max_cpu_extensions() in tcg-cpu.c).

If we count both the v4 and this RFC, the following extensions were added in
riscv_cpu_extensions[]:

+    MULTI_EXT_CFG_BOOL("smcntrpmf", ext_smcntrpmf, false),

+    MULTI_EXT_CFG_BOOL("smcsrind", ext_smcsrind, false),
+    MULTI_EXT_CFG_BOOL("sscsrind", ext_sscsrind, false),

+    MULTI_EXT_CFG_BOOL("smcdeleg", ext_smcdeleg, false),
+    MULTI_EXT_CFG_BOOL("ssccfg", ext_ssccfg, false),


All of them will be enabled by default in the 'max' CPU.

This is what I was referring to. We can just use the 'max' CPU and don't worry about
enabling defaults in rv64.

Daniel
