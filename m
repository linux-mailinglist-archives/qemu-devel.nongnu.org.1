It's hard to get a consensus if only two people care and they have 
different views... I think a separate init is not needed here and as noted 
the same pattern is present elsewhere and wasn't criticised or deprecated 
practice. The separate init and realize is also not a convention known to 
me (unless needed for other reason like I said above) so I regard it as a 
personal preference not something that needs to be followed generally.

Mark had a comment on the last patch about enabling a memory region that 
after thinking about it I think should be in a reset method. I plan to 
submit a new version with that.
