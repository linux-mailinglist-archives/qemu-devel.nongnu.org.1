I understand you'd like to have some kind of stylized comment that
automated testing will reject, to serve as a "do not post before
resolving this issue" reminder.  Fair?

If yes, whatever floats your boat and doesn't interfere with existing
practice.

    $ git-grep -w FIXME | wc -l
    493
    $ git-grep -w TODO | wc -l
    1249
    $ git-grep -w XXX | wc -l

    $ git-grep -w WIP
