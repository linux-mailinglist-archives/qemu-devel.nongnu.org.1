I'd rather not rely on this, it's hard to justify a driver change based
only on QEMU internals. And QEMU can't count on the driver always clearing
bypass. There could be situations where the guest can't afford to do it,
like if an endpoint is owned by the firmware and has to keep running.

There may be a separate argument for clearing bypass. With a coldplugged
VFIO device the flow is:

1. Map the whole guest address space in VFIO to implement boot-bypass.
   This allocates all guest pages, which takes a while and is wasteful.
   I've actually crashed a host that way, when spawning a guest with too
   much RAM.
2. Start the VM
3. When the virtio-iommu driver attaches a (non-identity) domain to the
   assigned endpoint, then unmap the whole address space in VFIO, and most
   pages are given back to the host.

We can't disable boot-bypass because the BIOS needs it. But instead the
flow could be:

1. Start the VM, with only the virtual endpoints. Nothing to pin.
2. The virtio-iommu driver disables bypass during boot
3. Hotplug the VFIO device. With bypass disabled there is no need to pin
   the whole guest address space, unless the guest explicitly asks for an
   identity domain.

However, I don't know if this is a realistic scenario that will actually
be used.

By the way, do you have an easy way to reproduce the issue described here?
I've had to enable iommu.forcedac=1 on the command-line, otherwise Linux
just allocates 32-bit IOVAs.

It also took me a while to get hotplug to work on x86:
pcie_cap_slot_plug_cb() didn't get called, instead it would call
ich9_pm_device_plug_cb(). Not sure what I'm doing wrong.
To work around that I instantiated a second pxb-pcie root bus and then a
pcie root port on there. So my command-line looks like:

 -device virtio-iommu
 -device pxb-pcie,id=pcie.1,bus_nr=1
 -device pcie-root-port,chassis=2,id=pcie.2,bus=pcie.1

 device_add vfio-pci,host=00:04.0,bus=pcie.2

And somehow pcieport and the assigned device do end up in separate IOMMU
groups.

Thanks,
Jean
