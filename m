Migration code should never access global_migration except during init /
shutdown (or a renamed version of it), that's the plan.. so no one should
use it within migration/.

I meant dropping all the global access to current_migration within
migration/ dir.

Consider all functions has the 1st parameter as MigrationState*, for
example.  Then we don't need that for internal use, while global_migration
is still needed for external use, but only for external use.

I can rename it to migration_export, but the question is whether the name
is the issue, or you'd think having two global variables pointing to
migration object is the issue / concern.

So I think fundaementally we indeed only need one global var there, if we
can cleanup the migration/ everywhere to always take the pointer from the
caller, then migration thread will take 1 refcount and that guarantees it's
available for migration/.

Yes, logically we could use RCU if we want, then take BQL for example only
if update.  but I worry that's an overkill: we'll need too many rcu read
lock all over the places..

That's indeed tricky, it's just that this is so far the easiest change I
can think of.

Yeh I get your concern.  I actually tried to observe such usages (for now,
especially when migration/ uses the misc.h exported functions) and they're
all safe.  I should have mentioned that.

For the other way round, I don't yet expect that to happen: the plan is
anything outside must call a function in include/migration/* and that must
only use global_migration.

That's how it works: migration thread will take one refcount and that'll
happen when migration is running but when VM shutdowns itself.  I checked
that all the migration code should be fine when using the exported
functions even if they should reference current_migration.

So logically if with such design, indeed internal migration/ code shouldn't
reference global_migration at all just to be always safe.

Any idea in your mind that can make this easier?  I'm definitely open to
suggestions.

It needs to be protected by BQL in this case, so anyone using exported
functions need to take BQL first.
