Yeah, I see what you mean. The issue here is that the iommu isn't
actually a parent of the devices that access through it. This is
true both in the "qbus/qdev bus tree" sense (where it is the PCI
controller device that owns the PCI bus that the devices are on)
and also in the QOM tree sense[*] (where usually the iommu and the
PCI controller are both created by the machine or the SoC, I guess?).
Instead iommus are separate devices that control data flow but
aren't in a parent-child relationship with the devices on either
side of that flow. There is a guarantee about reset ordering between
bus parent/child (so the PCI controller resets before it resets
the PCI bus that resets the PCI devices on the bus), but that doesn't
help the iommu.

[*] I have a vague idea that ideally we might want reset to be
QOM-tree based rather than qbus-tree based. But getting there from
here is non-trivial. And maybe what we really want is "objects,
especially SoCs, that create children can define what their reset
tree is, with the default being to reset all the QOM children".
Lots of non-thought-through complexity here ;-)
