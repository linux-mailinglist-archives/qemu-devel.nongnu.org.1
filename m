So finally tested with this:
-cpu host,hv_relaxed,hv_spinlocks=0x1fff,hv_vapic,hv_time,-vmx
The used hyper-v enhancements are the ones generally recommended for 
Windows vms.

Overall it seemed to really work: the performance was like bare metal, 
and the BSOD second problem was also gone (for this I had to test by 
installing another Win11 23h2 vm from scratch and run windows updates).

Also, unlike before, the Windows "suspend" functions also appeared; and 
most surprising: the actually worked.
Tried suspending, worked. Even tried enabling the infamous "fast boot" 
and shutting down vm. Result, it took a little more to shut down, but 
when powering on vm again, it did restore.
Though did each test only once...

Did these last tests because in many QEMU/KVM guides around internet I 
had read that, at least with Windows vms, it was very important to 
disable fast boot because QEMU/KVM did not support it and lead to ugly 
buggy functionalities.
So, did this change over time?

This could apparently imply that the culprit was the "vmx" CPU bit, 
which as already explained it's the one enabling nested virtualization 
inside the vm.
Overall, what would you think? Could this qualify as kind of a bug? Is 
nested virtualization often used in QEMU/KVM vms?
Could it be that Win11 23h2 has problems with this CPU bit?

Oh, and based on the results, I have few additional doubts:

If wanted to do live migration, would it be a matter of just switching 
"host" for "Skylake" or any other "fixed" QEMU CPU model, then just 
checking vm still boots correctly?

When trying "-cpu host,hv-passthrough", I did notice a considerable 
improvement in overall performance than when using 
"hv_relaxed,hv_spinlocks=0x1fff,hv_vapic,hv_time"; yet still noticeably 
not like bare metal. Why was this?

In another forum, I read a guy did not have problems updating from Win11 
22h2 to 23h2 on QEMU/KVM; though he used libvirt.
Among his CPU settings, he did not use the CPU passthrough, but a QEMU 
CPU model, which cannot remember which was except that it was a Xeon 
server model. Moreover, among the used CPU bits, there was vmx=on.
If the culprit here was apparently this vmx bit, how it is that for 
others it bore no consequence? The only difference was using a "server" 
CPU model instead of a "client" one. Though they did not talk about 
performance...

Thanks.
