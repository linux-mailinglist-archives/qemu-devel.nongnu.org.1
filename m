s.go

One thing that bothers me a little is using event's fields
directly instead of event type in the interface itself:

    type Events interface {
        StopEvent(time.Time) error
        ContEvent(time.Time) error
        BalloonChangeEvent(int64, time.Time) error
    }

In the gen_server_events.go:

    func (cmds *serverEvents) BalloonChangeEvent(actual int64, when time.Ti=
me) error {
        ev :=3D &BalloonChangeEvent{
            Actual: actual,
        }
        return cmds.QMP.SendEvent("BALLOON_CHANGE", ev, when)
    }

I'm actually in favor of moving the Type itself to the method:

    type Events interface {
        StopEvent(time.Time) error
        ContEvent(time.Time) error
        BalloonChangeEvent(BalloonChangeEvent, time.Time) error
    }

    func (cmds *serverEvents) BalloonChangeEvent(ev BalloonChangeEvent, whe=
n time.Time) error {
        return cmds.QMP.SendEvent("BALLOON_CHANGE", &ev, when)
    }


For the caller it might be an extra step but I see a few
benefits:

    1. Documentation: I'm generating the QAPI documentation of
       the events in its types. IDE's can jump-to-definition and
       see the documentation there. Obviously we could move the
       documentation here or duplicate it but the doc in the Type
       looks the right place imho.
   =20
    2. Changes in the Event fields over time would not impact the
       Breaking the Methods API. While some fields my be
       added/removed/changed, I think this would help break less
       the application when bumping the go module version.


I'm not sure about empty types like StopEvent. I'm generating it
with its doc but as it goes, it is bound to not be used, being
generated just as source of documentation. Still, if it so
happens that it does change in the future, we would need to
extend the Method with its field or its type.

    // Emitted when the virtual machine is stopped
    //
    // Since: 0.12
    //
    // .. qmp-example::    <- { "event": "STOP",      "timestamp": {
    // "seconds": 1267041730, "microseconds": 281295 } }
    type StopEvent struct{}


That also applies for commands..

    // Resume guest VM execution.
    //
    // Since: 0.14
    //
    // .. note:: This command will succeed if the guest is currently
    // running. It will also succeed if the guest is in the "inmigrate"
    // state; in this case, the effect of the command is to make sure
    // the guest starts once migration finishes, removing the effect of
    // the "-S" command line option if it was passed.    If the VM was
    // previously suspended, and not been reset or woken,   this command
    // will transition back to the "suspended" state.   (Since 9.0)  ..
    // qmp-example::    -> { "execute": "cont" }   <- { "return": {} }
    type ContCommand struct {}


I honestly did the requested changes a little while ago but I was
thinking about this and tinkering a little with the demo.

Cheers,
Victor
