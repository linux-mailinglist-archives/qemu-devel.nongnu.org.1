Hi Richard,

Thank you for the feedback.

I actually think we are close to the same understanding, except that one 
can use KVM to emulate (well, pass through to) Intel's virtualization 
hardware for a guest (TCG does only appears to support AMD's hardware 
virtualization interfaces), which is a use case I care about for my course.

One of my test cases for these debugging features was to have a simple 
guest/nested hypervisor running on emulated VT-x hardware. As in, the 
"guest" code enters VT root mode and sets up a VMCS and EPT, and 
launches a guest, etc.

My understanding is that when one uses kvm in this way, in the kernel 
kvm creates shadow page tables to merge the guest hypervisor and host 
hypervisor's tables transparently to the guest.

My reading of the KVM code is that this ioctl is the way that emulated 
architectural state (like the vmcs) is synced from the kernel back to 
qemu.  I don't see another KVM API for getting things like the extended 
page table root and certain VMCS configuration flags that one needs to 
walk the page tables.  Most of this state is not currently exposed to 
debugging features in qemu, which is why this definition was not needed.

I am open to other suggestions how to get that state, like the EPT root 
pointer, from KVM.  Perhaps I am missing something.

----

I will admit the intermediate address space is a lot to get one's head 
around.  I believe I have consistently used appropriate 
address_space_ld/st and friends at this point.

Thanks again,

Don
