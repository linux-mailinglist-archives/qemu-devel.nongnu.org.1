I admit I haven't reviewed what .merge_lists does but went to look
at its use cases (I see 'git grep -wW merge_lists' in my history)
and mis-read:

util/keyval.c-370- * - lists are concatenated
util/keyval.c-371- *
util/keyval.c-372- * - dictionaries are merged recursively
util/keyval.c-373- *
util/keyval.c-374- * - for scalar values, @merged wins
util/keyval.c-375- *
util/keyval.c-376- * In case an error is reported, @dest may already 
have been modified.
util/keyval.c-377- *
util/keyval.c-378- * This function can be used to implement semantics 
analogous to QemuOpts's
util/keyval.c:379: * .merge_lists = true case, or to implement -set for 
options backed by QDicts.

which made me confident enough with the patch description:

  > and now it's safe to activate 'merge_lists' for 'qemu_accel_opts'.
  > This will merge all accel options in the same list

OTOH I wasn't clear about the first patch and knew this one depends
on it, so if the first is wrong, this one is automatically discarded.

Don't blame the review but the reviewer :) Reviews aim to be
perfect, unfortunately the human beings sending them aren't
(at least I am not, as I just proved).

Thankfully maintainers are gatekeepers on their areas and can
catch issues like that. I duly noted "my Reviewed-by tag carries
some weigh" and could confuse other maintainers, and will think
it twice before posting it on topics I'm unsure. Thanks for
taking the time to warn me.

Regards,

Phil.
