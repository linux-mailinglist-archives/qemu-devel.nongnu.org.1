Yes, I think it makes sense to pick all of them up (and 622a7016 in the
middle, too), they were part of one series:

https://patchew.org/QEMU/20240731123207.27636-1-kwolf@redhat.com/

And this patch builds on top of that series, so rebasing it correctly
might not be trivial without the previous series.
