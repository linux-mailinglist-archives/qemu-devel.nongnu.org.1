Personally I'd try to not use -bios at all, as I see it as a magic /
confusing machine-specific command line option, doing some open-coded
"load this blob somewhere in memory". I prefer using explicit hardware
device model.

-bios usually call the "hw/loader.h" API which eventually model a ROM,
but do a lot of file format parsing magic. If you pass a plain ROM file,
no need for all this magic.
