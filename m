Sounds like there's a use case for management applications querying
TIDs, but query-migrationthreads falls short of serving it.

True.

If we decide we want to serve the management application use case now,
we should provide a suitable interface, then deprecate
query-migrationthreads.

If we decide not now or not at all, we can deprecate it right away.
Removal without deprecation is also possible, but I doubt breaking our
compatibility promise is justified.

Users of query-migrationthreads, please speak up!
