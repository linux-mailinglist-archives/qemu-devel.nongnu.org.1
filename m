Ah, I lost the wider context, sorry!

We identified three ways to deal with target-specific conditionals in a
single binary, and 'runtime_if' is one of them:

(1) Drop target-specific conditionals.

(2) Replace them by run-time checks.

(3) Have target-specific QAPI-generated code for multiple targets
    coexist in the single binary.

Both (2) and (3) keep the QAPI schema work as it does now.  None of us
likes (3) due to bloat and complexity.

The other two look both workable to me.  (2) keeps the QAPI schema work
exactly as it does now.  (1) is simpler, but the external interface
changes somewhat.  Its users seem to be okay with it.

So let's go with (1).

I can't afford a thorough review now, but I'll have a look, and I will
hold onto your series just in case.

The discussion was spread over multiple threads, which makes it hard to
follow.  I hope the conclusion is clear now.  If not, please ask for
further clarification.

Understood!
