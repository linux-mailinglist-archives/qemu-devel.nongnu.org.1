It should be a machine class extension with an i2c_setup handler and
a new "powernv10-rainier" machine modeling the board layout. The rest
looks good.

Please include the pca9552 series in the respin. The pca9554 model will
need a MAINTAINER (you?) I would be happy to let you take over pca9552
if you agree.

First, let's get patch 3 and 4 in QEMU 8.2.

Thanks,

C.
