There are only a bunch of ALSA states handled right now in the QEMU Alsa
driver (see alsa_poll_handler()):

    state =3D snd_pcm_state (hlp->handle);
    switch (state) {
    case SND_PCM_STATE_SETUP:
        alsa_recover (hlp->handle);
        break;

    case SND_PCM_STATE_XRUN:
        alsa_recover (hlp->handle);
        break;

    case SND_PCM_STATE_SUSPENDED:
        alsa_resume (hlp->handle);
        break;

    case SND_PCM_STATE_PREPARED:
        audio_run(hlp->s, "alsa run (prepared)");
        break;

    case SND_PCM_STATE_RUNNING:
        audio_run(hlp->s, "alsa run (running)");
        break;

=46or instance in poll mode it recovers in case of an xrun, which happens on
audio output if the audio output data was not delivered by the application =
in
time.

The other case is when the system was suspended (standby). It should also
recover the audio session here.

Now I haven't tested whether these would work in callback mode right now, b=
ut
looking at the code suggests that they might not.

Well, as a starting point you might try whether these cases described above
would still work in callback mode. Maybe it is even working, who knows.
