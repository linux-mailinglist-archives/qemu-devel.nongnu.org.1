libvirt will issue a 'stop' before invoking 'migrate' if it
needs to. QEMU should be able to optimize that scenario if
it sees CPUs already stopped when migrate is started ?

It increases the code paths because we will have to support
and test different behaviour wrt CPU state for fixed-ram
vs non-fixed ram usage.
