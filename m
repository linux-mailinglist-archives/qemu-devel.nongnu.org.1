I've not formally reviewed it, but I had a quick glance through the
I/O channel patches and they all look sensible. Pretty much  exactly
what I was hoping it would end up looking like.

Yes, from the migration code POV, this is a massive step forward - the
RDMA integration is no completely trivial for migration code.

The $million question is what the performance of this new implmentation
looks like on real hardware. As mentioned above the extra memory copies
will probably hurt performance compared to the old version. We need the
performance of the new RDMA impl to still be better than the plain TCP
sockets backend to make it worthwhile having RDMA.


With regards,
Daniel
