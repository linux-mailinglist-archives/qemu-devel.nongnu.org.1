Unless there is reason to use memfd we should start with the more 
generic POSIX variant that is available even on systems without memfd. 
Factoring stuff out as I drafted does look quite compelling.

I can help with the rework, and send it out separately, so you can focus 
on the "machine toggle" as part of this series.

Of course, if we find out we need the memfd internally instead under 
Linux for whatever reason later, we can use that instead.

But IIUC, the main selling point for memfd are additional features 
(hugetlb, memory sealing) that you aren't even using.

Right, the memfd here might be an unnecessary detail. Especially, 
because all things here are mmap'ed ... so I don't quite like this 
interface :)

Likely we should remove the "anon" part from the interface as well ... 
hmm ...

We want to instruct QEMU: "all guest RAM that is not explicitly 
specified should be sharable with another process".

"internal-ram-share=true"

"default-ram-share=true"

Maybe we can come up with something even better. But getting rid of the 
"anon" would be great. I think I prefer the latter (below).

That's one option, or we just handle it in qemu_ram_alloc_internal() as 
I drafted below.

Or we simply have another interface to allocate this "default RAM that 
does not come from a memory backend and is subject to the global 
toggle", and hide that detail (conditionally setting RAM_SHARED) in there.

Yes, as done in my draft patch. MAP_ANON|MAP_SHARED was primarily a hack 
to make this RDMA thingy fly that could not deal with anonymous memory, 
and we didn't have

memory-backend-ram,share=on was added via 
06329ccecfa022494fdba288b3ab5bcb8dff4159 before
memory-backend-memfd was added via dbb9e0f40d7d561dcffcf7e41ac9f6a5ec90e5b5

Both ended up in the same QEMU release.

So likely memory-backend-ram,share=on could just have used 
memory-backend-memfd if it would have been available earlier, at least 
on Linux ...


But, it looks like the use case for memory-backend-ram,share=on does no 
longer even exist, because

commit 1dfd42c4264bbf47415a9e73f0d6b4e6a7cd7393
Author: Philippe Mathieu-Daudé <philmd@linaro.org>
Date:   Thu Mar 28 12:53:00 2024 +0100

     hw/rdma: Remove deprecated pvrdma device and rdmacm-mux helper

Removed that mremap() from the code base.

So we can change how memory-backend-ram,share=on is implemented 
internally, as long as it keeps on working in a similar way.

If "memory-backend-ram,share=on" will be the same as specifying 
"default-ram-share=on", that would actually be quite nice ... no need to 
bring in memfds at all as long as we only want some memory with an fd to 
share with other processes.

My suggestion would be to unconditionally use shm (which is available 
even on kernels without memfd support; if required use memfd first and 
fallback to shmem) as in the patch I drafted.
