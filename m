I just took a quick at the JSON file.  It was a bit difficult to get a
sense of the structure of the file.  Maybe it makes more sense to those
who are more Arm-aware than me.  Or maybe that's what you meant by
"alpha quality" below :)

Out of curiosity, I tried to find the features for the register
"ID_AA64ISAR0_EL1".  I was navigating via trial-and-error with `jq`.
There's a lot of "right"/"left" traversing:

    $> jq '.parameters[136]|.constraints[1]|.right|.left|.value' Features.json 
    "FEAT_TME"

The register name is buried under this:

    $> jq '.parameters[136]|.constraints[1]|.right|.right|.left|.arguments' Features.json 
    [
      {
        "_type": "Types.Field",
        "value": {
          "field": "TME",
          "instance": null,
          "name": "ID_AA64ISAR0_EL1",
          "slices": null,
          "state": "AArch64"
        }
      }
    ]


I was niavely expecting a more predictable structure such as:

    $> jq '.register[ID_AA64ISAR0_EL1]|.fields' Features.json
    FEAT_RNG
    FEAT_TLBIOS
    ...

Hmm, it sounds like until point (b) is clarified, this file is out of
consideration from an upstream point of view.
