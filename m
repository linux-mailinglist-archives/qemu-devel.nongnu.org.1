I have a few concerns with IGVM:

1) Parsing is non-trivial. Parsing them in QEMU may open security issues.
2) Their data structures are tied to the target CPU structures like VMSA 
which FWIW are not fully owned by QEMU, are they?
3) I don't want to allocate a bounce buffer for an IGVM in the 
hypervisor. So we would need to ensure that the memory allocated by the 
loader for the IGVM does not overlap any memory the IGVM wants to 
consume. If the loader considers the IGVM as opaque, that is difficult 
to achieve.
