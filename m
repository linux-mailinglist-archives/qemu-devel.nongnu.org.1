In addition, a measurement log is just one of the interesting features
that a TPM provides to OS. The other TPM features are still relevant
and useful to confidential VMs.

As a high level goal I think we should be aiming to make it possible for
users to move their existing VM workloads from non-confidentail to
confidential environments, simply as a choice at deployment time. To make
this as practical as possible, confidential VMs  need to be aiming to
match non-confidential VM features where ever it is practical to do so.
Users & vendors should not need to build & carry around 2 sets of disk
images - one setup for confidential and one setup for non-confidential.
Following existing standards will reduce the work both for OS developers,
app developers and users alike, to adopt the CVM world.

IOW, this is a long winded way of saying that we should be looking to
provide a complete *standards compliant*, trusted TPM implementation to
confidential VMs, not providing a cherry-picked selection of a few
TPM-like features.

On the x86 side of things, the route to providing a trusted TPM is via
SVSM, both for SNP and TDX. Microsoft's recently open sources openhcl
similarly provides a st

I don't know so much about RME. Is providing a trusted TPM a job for
the RMM ?
