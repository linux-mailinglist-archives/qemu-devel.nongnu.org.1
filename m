I doubt anyone will be able to use it productively with virt, but I am
regularly surprised by people's creativity.

The intended target machine is vmapple, which is the only known way to run
aarch64 macOS guests. The PVG patches were part of that series, the PCI
variant is useful independently of it though; Philippe said at one point
early Jan/late Dec he was going to merge the rest of the patch series
containing that machine type, but there were some question marks about the
software GICv3 dependency and HVF I believe. I'll try to rebase that series
and re-post it in the next few days - I've been too busy with another
project to stay on top of chasing that down, but I'd really like to get it
done for 10.0.

Phil
