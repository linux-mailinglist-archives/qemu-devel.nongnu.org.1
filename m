I'll add this in the next version.

It's throwing a 22 (EINVAL).

I don't mind rephrasing it to "The KVM module is not able to disable extension %s"
But I'm unsure what we gain from not showing the error code.

Aside EINVAL the other (very unlikely) error code being thrown would be EBUSY. Should
we handle EBUSY differently in this case? I don't think so. If we're already throwing a
warning, with error code, the user is well informed about the guest having a flaky
start and can proceed with discretion. Regardless of the extension disablement failing
due to EINVAL or EBUSY.


Thanks,

Daniel
