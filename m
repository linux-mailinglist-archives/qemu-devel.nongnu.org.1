I just reviewed the series. IMO, if you create a class override for
RestOutput, as I suggested, there will be just a single line
of difference:

	            (r"QEMU_[A-Z_]+ +", "", 0),

Not sure about others, but, from my side, I don't mind picking a
patch like that at Kernel upstream, if it doesn't cause any
regressions there (unlikely, but I didn't check).

Yeah, it sounds so.

I did test building only from 0.17 up to 0.21.2. It worked fine
for all of them. Now, 0.22 was released on 2025-07-29. I didn't
test it yet, nor I'm aware of anyone complaining about it on
Kernel MLs yet.

Btw, I wrote an upstream script to test building docs with different
Sphinx and docutils versions.

It is under:
	scripts/test_doc_build.py

It probably makes sense to port it to QEMU and add it to CI. Most of
the logic is independent from the Kernel. The only part that would
require adjustments is the logic at _handle_version() that creates
make commands to clean docs and build html.

Great!

Heh, an early change on 6.17 cycle incidentally made it requiring
3.9 ;-)

We ended changing it to preserve 3.7+ support, as we wanted to
ensure it would build with OpenSuse Leap.

This one predates kernel-doc.py, as it exists at the Perl version:

	$ grep Definition scripts/kernel-doc.pl
	    print $lineprefix . "**Definition**::\n\n";

It seems this was added on this upstream commit:

commit eaf710ceb5ae284778a87c0d0f2348c19e3e4751
Author: Jonathan Corbet <corbet@lwn.net>
Date:   Fri Sep 30 11:52:09 2022 -0600

    docs: improve the HTML formatting of kerneldoc comments
    
    Make a few changes to cause functions documented by kerneldoc to stand out
    better in the rendered documentation.  Specifically, change kernel-doc to
    put the description section into a ".. container::" section, then add a bit
    of CSS to indent that section relative to the function prototype (or struct
    or enum definition).  Tweak a few other CSS parameters while in the
    neighborhood to improve the formatting.

While I don't matter much about that, IMO the best would be to drop
the extra ":" at the end.

Feel free to submit a Kernel patch upstream dropping it from 
scripts/lib/kdoc/kdoc_output.py.

Yeah, indenting Description makes sense to me. 

Thanks,
Mauro
