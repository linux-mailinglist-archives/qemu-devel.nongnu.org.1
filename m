This is a common error when modifying code of the dataplane, it is
unlikely to do deep changes and not see this error :). It indicates
that your code is marking the descriptor id 0 as used when the guest
didn't make it available.

If this is happening in control virtqueue, I'd check if the code is
setting the flags as used in ring[1] when it shouldn't. But my bet is
that the rx queue is the wrong one.

Two possibilities about this part:
a) You're spending "too long" in the debugger in QEMU. From the kernel
POV, the function virtqueue_get_buf is taking too long to complete so
it detects it as a lockup. You can check this scenario by not running
QEMU under GDB or disabling all breakpoints. You can ignore this
message if you don't find the error this way. If you still see the
message, goto possibility b.

b) The kernel has a bug that makes it softlockup in virtqueue_get_buf.
The kernel should not soft lockup even if your changes were malicious
:(, so it is something to be fixed. If you have the time, can you test
with the latest upstream kernel?

Due to the net subsystem lock, CVQ handling is not as robust / secure
against this error as the dataplane queues. There is an ongoing effort
to make it more robust, so maybe this is something to fix in that
line.

Can you put the whole backtrace that prints the kernel?

Ok, I don't know how I read the function to answer you that :(. Let me
start from scratch,

In line 171, we're copying data from QEMU internals, that are not in
the guest memory, to other QEMU internals. So no cpu_to_le* or
le*to_cpu is needed.

No endianness conversion is needed here for the same reason, all is
internal to QEMU and not intended to be seen by the guest.
