There seems to be a bit of confusion about how this zoom-to-fit option is 
implemented by different -display backends and I'm not sure what is the 
intended behaviour or how other -display backends handle it. Maybe a 
single option is not even enough to describe all possible preferences so 
another one i.e. keep-aspect=true|false may also be needed to cover all 
possible settings (don't zoom, zoom with aspect ratio kept, zoom to fit 
window even if that stretches the picture out of aspect ratio). For 9.0 
ptobsbly we should go for consistency with other backends now as adding 
new options is not possible during freeze and then resolve this 
afterwards.

The flicker may be due to the resize algorithm used by macOS not giving 
the same result always. To resolve it maybe yet another option may be 
needed to not zoom to full available window but try to keep the zoom 
factor some integer value to avoid fractional scaling but I'm not sure 
that's the best way to solve it.
