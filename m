The pl011 stuff was deliberate decisions:

- device.rs vs pl011.rs: the device was written as a crate, so it's
essentially its own library, plus pl011/src/pl011.rs would be
redundant :)
  That said, it's not important, we can choose either convention. I
like the less redundancy and separation of concerns: if pl011 gets
converted into a module in a future refactor, it could keep its
functionality split into different submodules and `pl011.rs` or
`pl011/mod.rs` would be the device module.
  Rust's concept of files being either a leaf module or parent module
does not translate to C's "every file is a compilation unit" cleanly.
- Using typed registers instead of constants: yes coming from C I can
understand it can feel unfamiliar. I specifically wanted to make the
register fields typed to avoid making the implementation a "C port",
and I think it's worthwhile to use the type system as much as
possible.
  A straight C port would result into integer constants with integer
typed fields everywhere for registers/flags.
  Yes, From/Into aren't const, at least yet, but it's not really a
hotpath performance wise. I think non-dynamically dispatched trait
methods can be inlined by annotating the `fn from(..)` impl with a
`#[inline(always)]` hint but I haven't confirmed this, just
speculation.
  Again, no strong opinions here. I like the "everything is typed"
approach and I think it's worth it to explore it because it allows us
to "make invalid/illegal states unrepresentable" as one sage article
goes.

I actually have some WIP patches for this I put a pause on and can
continue e.g. https://gitlab.com/epilys/rust-for-qemu/-/commit/c2c97caaaf03=
