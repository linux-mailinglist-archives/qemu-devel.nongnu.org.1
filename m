To repeat what I said in the ticket, the 0x40 byte originates from when
this was first committed to QEMU. We can see the finall accepted patch

  https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2008-07/msg00385.html

but tracing the history back further, this was *not* in the version of
the patches submitted by the original author 2 years earlier:

 https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2006-10/msg00339.html
 
There's no explanation of this difference. Could easily be a left-over
hack from some debugging attempt that no one noticed until now.

It can't have been forcing a specific vendor's prefix, since prefixes
are more than 1 byte long. To me, it smells like a debugging hack
where someone wanted to see this fixed byte appear, though even that
is a bit wierd as you could just set the desired mac as a cli arg.

Anyway I can't come up with a justification for keeping this, so

..unless someone believes we need to tie this change to a machine type
version ?

With regards,
Daniel
