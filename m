My understanding is that the reason you coded all the sanity checks
into qemu was to provide saner error messages for users that create
invalid keys than what gnutls does (keys are already hard enough to
create securely, so it is nice to be told how to fix your key rather
than just "it didn't work").  I also understand that newer algorithms
really can't use this flag, and we don't want to reject use of better
algorithms, so this patch makes sense as documented.

Still, is there any risk that for older algorithms, where the 'key
encipherment' bit did matter, that we could now end up processing an
incomplete key that we would have previously rejected with a nice
message but which now goes to gnutls and reverts back to the poorer
error message quality or even worse being used despite being a
security risk?  I don't think it is a high risk - fewer people would
be generating certificates that explicitly request an older algorithm
but not following all the recommended steps, compared to the more
common case of people following your documentation and getting the
newest defaults that just work; anyone determined enough to get an
older algorithm deserves the breakage if their explicit instructions
to override the default are weaker than normal.

In saying that, I'm hoping that gnutls still diagnoses certs that
cannot be properly used for the purpose at hand (whether or not the
'key encipherment' bit must be set or cleared), even if it gives a
less-than-stellar diagnostic message about rejecting a cert.  If I'm
wrong, and an incomplete cert with an older algorithm but missing the
bit turns into a security bypass, it's much more than QEMU that would
be impacted.  So, I'm comfortable with:
