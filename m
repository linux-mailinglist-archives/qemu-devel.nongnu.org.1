Chosen based on whether they exercise code paths that are unique
and interesting during the RAM transfer phase.

Essentially the goal is that if we have N% code coverage before this
patch, then we should still have the same N% code coverage after this
patch.

The TLS tests exercise code paths that are unique during the migration
establishment phase. Once establishd they don't exercise anything
"interesting" during RAM transfer phase. Thus we don't loose code coverage
by runing TLS tests non-live.

The compress thread logic is unique/interesting during RAM transfer
so benefits from running live. The wait vs non-wait scenario tests
a distinct codepath/logic.

multifd has been a massive source of bugs and has very different
codepaths from non-multifd, so is needed for codeage.
