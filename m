That means all devices should be either big or little endian and there 
should be no native endian ones. Why do we have those then? That's why 
this endianness property should either be removed from ops and only 
attached to it when added to a machine if needed or kept to show which 
machines it can be attached to: only big, little or both endian which is 
what it seems to be doing now.

How would that work with this series? So the proposed solution is to 
double the devices now marked as NATIVE_ENDIAN to have a big and a little 
endian variant for them so the board can choose? That does not exist in 
real as you wrote, there's only one device so then this is probably not 
the right way to model it.

If we say NATIVE_ENDIAN means that the device can be attached to either 
big or little endian machine then we can keep this constant but when 
adding the ops to a memory region the board has to then decide which 
endianness it is and replace it with either big or little. Then we don't 
need two versions of the same device and NATIVE_ENDIAN means that the 
device can be used in both machines.

In real life probably all devices can be used with either CPU and if they 
are accessed in little or big endian is only determinded by how they are 
wired on the board. So the device endianness only means what endianness 
the device expects for something (what exactly? e.g. a video chip may have 
a frame buffer and a registers area with different endianness). So this 
should be the board that decides this not the device. Therefore it may not 
need to be defined when MemoryRegionOps is defined at all (or only as a 
hint to show what the device expects normally) and then 
memory_region_init_io which takes the MemoryRegionOps should also take an 
endianness corresponding the board and set it at that point. It can warn 
if the device endianness does not match what the board sets but you can 
still connect a big endian device to a little endian CPU as long as the 
drivers write the right values or the data lines are connected the right 
way, the latter of which corresponds to NATIVE_ENDIAN now as the 
conversion is done by the wiring so drivers don't need to care.

But if it's simpler to just double the few devices that need to be used 
this way then it's a possible solution but if there's a cleaner one with 
not much more complexity then maybe that should be considered, because the 
way to define these doubled devices is a bit confusing for new people (on 
top of that defining devices is already confusing with the lot of boiler 
plate code needed). So if this could be kept simpler that would be a good 
thing IMO.
