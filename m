Yeah. To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if actually the
11mpcore and the GICv2 behave the same and the behaviour
we have under REV_11MPCORE is just "what the person who
implemented the QEMU model guessed at based on the rather
nonspecific 11mpcore TRM documentation". But at this late date
there's really no benefit in trying to find out :-)
