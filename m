I still think this patch is useful. Having the guest "steal" the kb/mouse from
the host immediately upon starting is frankly annoying and most of the time
unnecessary as at this point the guest is barely booting anyway. Most of the
time I don't need/want to redirect the kb/mouse until the guest is fully booted
and instead want to do something on the host while the guest is starting in the
background. So I end up having to press the toggle keys every time after
starting the guest just so I can keep control of my inputs. This might seem like
a minor annoyance but it is still that, an annoyance.

This can get particularly annoying if the guest is started from a script. In
this situation the guest may not necessarily be started immediately upon running
the script depending on what the script is doing prior to the `virsh start`
command. So you can't tell exactly when your kb/mouse are going to be grabbed
from you. If you do something else on your host in the meantime, while the
script is running in the background, you end up having your inputs grabbed from
you without notice.

There are a few posts[1][2] on the internet asking how to prevent evdev grabbing
upon boot, so it seems that I am not the only one that would like to see such an
option.
