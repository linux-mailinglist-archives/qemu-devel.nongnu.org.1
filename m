Hmm yes; I wished we can have device properties that user can never
specify, but only set from internals.  It's just that applying a compat
property so far require a generic device property.  Or say, it'll be nice
that compat property can tweak a class variable too then no property to
introduce.

We could even add a migration blocker for x-virtio-net-offload-enforce=ON,
but again it could be too aggresive.  I think it might be better we bet
nobody will even know there's the parameter, so it won't be used in manual
setup.  OTOH, "guest_uso4" can be too easiy to find there's the AUTO
option: I normally use ",guest_uso4=?" to just dump the possible values.

Thanks,
