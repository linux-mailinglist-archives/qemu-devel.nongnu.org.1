More or less; though it does test in every supported python interpreter if
you happen to have multiple installed, so it can be a way to catch errors
that exist between minreqs and $current, but it's still generally only a
test that I think you should run if you are touching the Python stuff in a
major way; i.e. if you're sending something that's a PR for *me*, I think
you should run it. If you're just doing a quick fix to qapi that doesn't do
any deep Python trickery, I'd trust either check-minreqs/CI or check-dev to
be sufficient due diligence.

In other words: *any one* of these tests are likely to catch errors due to
incorrect code and is sufficient due diligence; making sure they *all* pass
is more of a job for *me* to catch ecosystem problems across our wide
platform and python version support matrix.

I very often run "check minreqs" and "check tox" and consider that
exhaustive. the dev test is there only as a quick smoke test if you don't
have a battleship of python interpreters installed, but it's busted at the
moment due to fairly recent setuptools changes @_@
