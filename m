> 1. If the compression design is based on Zlib/Deflate/Gzip streaming mode, then we indeed need more channels to maintain concurrent processing. Because each time a multifd packet is compressed (including 128 independent pages), it needs to be compressed page by page. These 128 pages are not concurrent. The concurrency is reflected in the logic of multiple channels for the multifd packet.

Right.  However since you said there're only a max of 8 IAA devices, would
it also mean n_multifd_threads=8 can be a good enough scenario to achieve
proper concurrency, no matter the size of data chunk for one compression
request?

Maybe you meant each device can still process concurrent compression
requests, so the real capability of concurrency can be much larger than 8?

Right, if more concurrency is wanted, you can use this async model; I think
Juan used to suggest such and I agree it will also work.  It can be done on
top of the basic functionality merged.

However, we found that there are still many problems with this, so we plan to provide a new change in the next version that the independent QPL/IAA acceleration function as said above.

For example, we can add the "accel" option to the compression method, and then the user must specify the same accelerator by compression accelerator parameter on the source and remote ends (just like specifying the same compression algorithm)

Can we avoid naming it as "accel"?  It's too generic, IMHO.

If it's a special algorithm that only applies to QPL, can we just call it
"qpl" here?  Then...

Here IMHO we don't need qpl then, because the "qpl" compression method can
enforce an hardware accelerator.  In summary, not sure whether this works;

Compression methods: none, zlib, zstd, qpl (describes all the algorithms
that might be used; again, qpl enforces HW support).

Compression accelerators: auto, none, qat (only applies when zlib/zstd
chosen above)

Thanks.  If you plan to post patch, please attach:

Reported-by: Xiaohui Li <xiaohli@redhat.com>

As that's reported by our QE team.

Maybe you can already add an unit test (migration-test.c, under tests/)
which should expose this issue already, by setting z*-level to non-1 then
query it back, asserting that the value did change.

Thanks for all these information.  I'm personally still curious why Intel
would like to provide two new technology to service similar purposes merely
at the same time window.

Could you put many of these information into a doc file?  It can be
docs/devel/migration/QPL.rst.

Also, we may want an unit test to cover the new stuff when the whole design
settles. It may cover all mode supported, but for sure we can skip hw
accelerated use case.
