Hi Dongli,

Usually, if my TDX series is going to be merged soon, or you think this 
series won't be accepted soon before TDX series, you can just mention in 
the cover letter that this series has a dependency on other patch.

For the case that your series might be accepted earlier, it's better to 
just grab the patches needed by this series from others' series. Just 
like what you did here.

Like Zhao mentioned, when you grab a patch from others and post with 
your series, you need keep the original patch as is (the unchanged 
authorship and signed-off-by chain), in addition to add your 
signed-off-by at last in the chain.

Be sure to add your signed-off-by, which tells you are involved.
