This case is handled by checking the difference between counters
`d->be_written[i]` and `d->be_min_written`. The idea is that device, which
already "swallowed" some portion of data, will be skipped from writing to i=
t,
until it catches up with the stream.

Please take a look into the `char_mux_be_test()` test case, where the
EAGAIN scenario is tested. The line test-char.c:716 explicitly shows the
repeat of the write procedure after EAGAIN was received.

Right. The intention is to have both consoles simultaneously
working, for example having char-based tio (over a socket chardev)
and image-based vnc (over a vc chardev):

    -chardev socket,path=3D/tmp/sock,server=3Don,wait=3Doff,id=3Dsock0 \
    -chardev vc,id=3Dvc0 \

and both are connected to the same frontend device.

I agree with you on the "mixer" naming concern, this did not come to
my mind. As far as I understand the logic of `mux-fe`, it just doesn't seem
possible to have both frontends running at the same time, because they
will both generate output, at least that's the case for virtual consoles:
imagine you have two virtual console frontends working at the same time
and one backend. Any command you enter from a backend causes the two
separate frontends to output completely different data.

On the other hand, several backend devices can easily be simultaneously
attached to one frontend, the analogy is simple: several monitors, several
keyboards, etc work perfectly fine with a single PC. At least this is how
I see this, please correct me if I'm wrong.

Do you think we need to artificially introduce multiplexing logic to be ful=
ly
compliant with multiplexer naming? It's not hard to do, repeating
`mux_proc_byte()` from `mux-fe`. In my use-case, I'll still need to disable
multiplexing in favor of 'mixing', for example with the 'mixer=3Don' option=
,
i.e. '-chardev mux-be,mixer=3Don,...`. Or do you think it should be some
completely different beast, something like mixer chardev?
