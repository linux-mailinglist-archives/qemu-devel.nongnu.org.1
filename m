I would not class this as an advantage for QEMU in merging this
series. It is defining what amounts to a new externally consumable
interface for QEMU, which is intended to be used by libvirt. Even
if it not consumed at runtime, it is still implying API guarantees.
QEMU really does not want to be adding new interfaces, as there is
a strong desire to reduce all external interaction with QEMU to
exclusively be QMP based.

If we external usage, then we're left with a pretty weak justification
for introducing a new custom code generator here IMHO.

In terms of the CPUID_ constants, I think what would make more sense
from QEMU's POV is to define them all as a QAPI enum.

eg

  { 'enum': 'CPUID',
    'data': [
        'fpu', 'vme', 'de', 'pse', 'tsc',
	.....
    ] }

which will result in QAPI generating constants

    CPUID_VME
    CPUID_FPU
    CPUID_DE
    ...etc

along with a constant <-> string conversion table.

The feature words could use the constants directly instead of their
string form

FeatureWordInfo feature_word_info[FEATURE_WORDS] = {
    [FEAT_1_EDX] = {
        .type = CPUID_FEATURE_WORD,
        .features = {
	    [0] = CPUID_FPU,
    	    [1] = CPUID_VME,
	    [2] = CPUID_DE,
            ...etc...
        },
        .cpuid = {.eax = 1, .reg = R_EDX, },
        .tcg_features = TCG_FEATURES,
        .no_autoenable_flags = CPUID_HT,
    },


which I think encodes the information just as effectively as the yaml
file does.

With regards,
Daniel
