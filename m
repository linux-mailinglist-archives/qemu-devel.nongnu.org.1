I'm not sure if I read it right.  Perhaps you meant something more generic
than -platform but similar?

For example, "-profile [PROFILE]" qemu cmdline, where PROFILE can be either
"perf" or "compat", while by default to "compat"?

If so, I think I get the idea, but it'll be challenging in at least these
aspects:

  - We already have (at least.. that I'm aware of) three layers of
    specifying a property for a device, they are:

    (1) default value
    (2) compat property (from machine type definitions)
    (3) qemu cmdline (specify one property explicitly)

    So far, there's an order we apply these (1-3), while (3) has the top
    priority to overwrite (1-2), and (2) to overwrite (1).

    The new "-profile", if I read it right, introduce (4), and it's already
    unclear to me how that interacts with (3) when -profile says "turn
    FEAT1 on" while cmdline says otherwise.

    It can make things very compilcated, IMHO.

  - This still will break the "QEMU cmdline defines the guest ABI", e.g.,
    consider this USO* thing that we boot an old machine type on a new
    system that has QEMU+Linux USO* all enabled.  We specify "-profile
    perf" there.  Then when we try to migrate to another older QEMU it'll
    still fail the migration instead of any way telling us "migration is
    not compatible".  So even if it helps the user turning on knobs, it
    doesn't sound like to fix the problem we're working on?

For whatever profile setup, it sounds like more applicable to a Libvirt
option that user can choose.  That may avoid above two concerns I have,
especially the latter. But I really don't know much on Libvirt, and this
can be some extra effort too on top of either QEMU / Libvirt, and we may
need to justify worthwhile.

Do we really concern about users not enabling features that much?  I
thought users always can manually change the XML and add whatever they
need, and device properties do not like too special here to me.  I mean, we
have bunch of "features" exported as new "-devices" and users must opt-in
for them by changing the XML.  We never worried on user not using them.  I
doubt whether we worried too much on user not opt-in, especially for
performance features, because they're, IMHO, targeting advanced users.

Thanks,
