I agree here. I like Cornelia's suggestion in the other thread of providing=
 the subchannel
identifiers in the message so there's a hint of -where- the (presumed) typo=
 came from.

It's true that the only -supported- use case is passthrough DASD, and we al=
low other device types to
be passed through. The only ones we fence off are what we know aren't going=
 to work, like FCPs. IIRC
we'd talked a few years ago about a plan for a more detailed allow-list of =
passthrough devices and
configurations, but that fell off the back of the todo list. Short of dusti=
ng all that off, I don't
know that blocking virtio-ccw from vfio is going to buy us anything that Th=
omas' patch doesn't
already provide.
