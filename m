Yeah, I think we reasonably could.

For an implementation, there is no BFC instruction. If you look
at the Arm ARM entry for BFC, it says "This instruction is an alias
of the BFM instruction", which means it exists only for
assemblers and disassemblers and assembly authors.
(And if you look at the BFM instruction, there is no subset of the
encoding that is gated on any feature; so there is no extra
behaviour of BFM that got added here.)

These "alias" instructions are there to make the assembly be
a bit easier to read. The only unusual thing about this alias
is that it wasn't in the architecture right from the start,
which I think is why it got a FEAT_ name: to flag up that
if you're writing asm or if you're an assembler author then
you need to do something here. But if you're creating an
implementation of a CPU, then there's nothing to do, because
you already implemented the handling of BFM as part of ARMv8.0.

For an example of an alias that was present from v8.0, look
at "MOV (to/from SP)". This is an "ADD (immediate)" instruction
under the hood, but you can write it in assembly source as
"MOV SP, Xn", and the assembler will put in the same bit pattern
as if you'd written "ADD SP, Xn, #0". In QEMU (or in a hardware
implementation) we don't need to do anything for "MOV SP, Xn",
because our implementation of "ADD (imm)" will catch it.

I elaborated a bit on that in my other email -- they're
doing a similar thing, but sse-counter.c is M-profile.
