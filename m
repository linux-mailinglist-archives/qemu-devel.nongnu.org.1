We have fallbacks in the ati_2d_blt function so if pixman does not help 
it's easy to call the function with parameters that make it use the fall 
back. I just think it would be better to have the part that writes to the 
frame buffer at one place so the checks for writing outside the valid 
memory and doing all the pixel combining is not duplicated. So even if we 
don't use pixman it may be better to do the actual blit with the same 
function that does normal blits. I did not consider combining flushes just 
calling the same function for each line when flushing and if pixman proves 
to be an overhead we can use the fallback instead.

Isn't that some ROP which we need to implement for blits using 
transparency anyway? I think the host data gets either straight pixels 
that we need to copy or some bitmask that need to be extended either with 
fg bg or fg over existing image. The latter could be implemented by not 
starting with empty row buffer but getting the row from the frame buffer 
then masking and ORing or whatever combining is needed. But if we have a 
ROP for that even for normal blits we'll need that anyway in the blit 
function.

This could be investigated later as possible optimisation but maybe not 
needed at first.

Pixman has no documentation so the only info is looking at the source. But 
maybe we don't need to change anything if the host data flush prepares the 
source buffer by either using the data for datatype 3, adding bg/fg for 
mono extract and either copying the dest row first into the buffer then do 
the fg with transparency from host data bits then finally in all 3 cases 
just call ati_2d_blt with the prepared source buffer. That way no changes 
to ati_2d_blt is needed other than allowing it to take a state with the 
source and dest data rather than getting it from registers. The part that 
gets data from regs can be split out then what's left is what we need for 
host data. I haven't thought through it in detail but I think it could 
work and avoid duplicating the part that writes pixels to frame buffer.
