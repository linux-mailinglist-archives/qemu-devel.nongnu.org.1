I have a test case this fixes which I think trumps a theoretical UAF
without a test case.

Why would the guest attempt to access after triggering the free itself?
Wouldn't it be correct to fault the guest for violating its own memory
safety rules?

How can the guest access something that is now unmapped? The RCU should
only run after the flatview has been updated.
