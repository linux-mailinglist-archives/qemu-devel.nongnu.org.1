I don't remember anything in the spec prohibiting it.

That will bring back all issues with cached vs non-cached memory 
accesses, no? So edk2 will always access that memory as device memory 
which means it bypasses the cache, while QEMU will access it through the 
cache. So that buffer would need to actually be MMIO memory I suppose?

I'm not worried yet about where we place that memory, but more about 
ensuring that we actually have a working path to access it. We can 
always find space in the PCI hole, as long as we properly advertise it 
to all stakeholders via ACPI and memory map.
