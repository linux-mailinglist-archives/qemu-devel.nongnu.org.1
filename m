See here for detailed docs:
https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/devel/submitting-a-patch.html

In short you'd need to make the patch the same way you did the first 
version with the changed content but as [PATCH v2] and send it again as a 
new patch like you did the first time. (You can use -v2 option to git 
format-patch to add v2 to subject but if you're not using git format-patch 
directly then I'm not sure what option will do that for the way you send 
the patch.)
