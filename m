These are io_uring workers. We did suspect that for a bit here too (when
we switched to using that as a default two years ago, it caused a few
issues), but there are also reports of people using aio=native and
aio=threads. And for the costumer ticket with the PLT corruption,
switching away from io_uring also didn't help.

Not anything that should mess with polling AFAIK.
