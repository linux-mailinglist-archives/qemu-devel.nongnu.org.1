Understood.  In OS-First path, it couldn't be a sync event.

I think my previous understanding about MCE was wrong.  Here is my 
current understanding after some research:

Since CXL device is a memory device, while CPU consumes a poison page of 
CXL device, it always triggers a MCE by interrupt (INT18), no matter 
which-First path is configured.  This is the first report.  Then 
currently, in FW-First path, the poison event is transferred according 
to the following process: CXL device -> firmware -> OS:ACPI->APEI->GHES 
-> MCE.  This is the second one.  These two MCEs represent the same 
poisoning page, which is the so-called "duplicate report", right?  Now, 
the memory_failure() handling I'm trying to add in OS-First path, is 
also another duplicate report.

So, the primary issue to be solved is the second MCE report.  As you 
suggested, make it a optional action.

Please correct me if I'm wrong.  Thank you very much!
