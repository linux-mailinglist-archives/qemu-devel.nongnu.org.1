It won't get a wrong id as the Qemu platform won't support those.
Hence, you can not run perf for those events to begin with.

So user won't be confused. We

restrict their CI to that. I really do  not see

IMO, it is more confusing to show bogus data rather than restricting
the number of events an user can run on Qemu platforms. Clearly, you
think otherwise. I think we can agree to disagree here. Let's
consolidate our patches to provide the infrastructure for the actual
events. The bogus event support can be a separate series(per vendor)
as that warrants a different discussion whether it is useful for users
or not.

Sounds good ?

any problem to let the vendor handle this situation. At least vendor
can decide by his own to count/not to count some types of event, this
gonna bring flexibility and the transparency of the solution and, in
general, if we=E2=80=99ll bring some rational reason why we can't add such
events we can always forbid to do such thing.
