Sorry, no. What I said is wrong. It's just that the test does something
very pathological and does not even use COW/backing files. All the
mirror targets are separate diff images there. So yes, we can do the
same as block_copy_calculate_cluster_size() and the issue only appears
in the same edge cases as for backup where we can error out early. This
also applies to copy-mode=write-blocking AFAICT.
