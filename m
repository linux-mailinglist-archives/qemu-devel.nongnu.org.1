I always thought about this priv spec filter as a way to determine the time
window that the extension was ratified/defined. In this example it's been used
to filter out zca/zcd/zcf from the sifive-u54 chip because this chip is older
than those extensions, so it doesn't make sense to enable them.

I think it's hard to pick and choose which extensions will have a priv version check
or not. If we're bothered with the priv spec check per se then we should remove it
entirely. Here's my plan to do it:

- remove cfg.priv_ver. This is a very old attribute that allow users to set the priv_ver
for generic CPUs like rv64. I'm doing changes in the user options for TCG flags and the
very existence of this option forces me to make priv checks for all extensions we're
auto-enabling during realize() (because I can't be sure whether the user changed the
priv_ver of rv64 to something older);

- split the realize() functions between generic and vendor CPUs again. It was merged together
earlier this year (I did it) because, back then, we were doing too much stuff during
realize() that was needed for named CPUs, but the side effect is what we're seeing now:
the common code is enabling unwanted extensions for vendor CPUs. The code is very different
now, and I believe that we can at least skip validate_set_extensions() for vendor CPUs;

- at this point, vendor CPUs aren't auto-enabling any features and generic CPUs are always
set to PRIV_VER_LATEST. This means that we can remove all code related to disable extensions
via priv spec, and then all artifacts related to priv spec.


However, even if we're all onboard with removing it, this is still 8.2 work. For 8.1 I believe
this patch is a good fix to relief users from these warnings.


Thanks,

Daniel
