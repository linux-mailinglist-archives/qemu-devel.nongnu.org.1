You need '-drive if=none,id=hd0,format=raw,file=README' as a single option 
not split into two. With if=none -drive won't auto-create a device so you 
then also need a corresponding -device option for the drive that you seem 
to have already above. If you want -hda to work you may need something 
like commit d36b2f4e78 (hw/ppc/sam460ex: Support short options for adding 
drives) for the machine you use. In particular the MachineClass 
block_default_type field says what's the default interface that -drive and 
other short options should use (at least I think so, I'm no expert on this 
either but searching for it should at least point to where it's handled).
