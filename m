The other thing that plays in here is that we actively encourage use of
g_autoptr everywhere. It is very unusual for "Error" to be a type that
does NOT want g_autoptr, and thus the mistake is very much on the cards.

I've proposed it before myself & Markus caught it. I also caught one
other proposals to add it since my attempt. This third time it slipped
through review. I expect we'll see a 4th attempt to add it at some point.

With regards,
Daniel
