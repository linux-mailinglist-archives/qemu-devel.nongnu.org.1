It's enough to just enable kvmclock2 for Guest; kvmclock (old) is
redundant in the presence of kvmclock2.

So operating both feature bits at the same time is not a reasonable
choice, we should only keep kvmclock2 for Guest. It's possible because
the oldest linux (v4.5) which QEMU i386 supports has kvmclock2.

Pls see:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.5/source/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm_para.h#L22

With this in mind, I'm trying to implement a silky smooth transition to
"only kcmclock2 support".

This series is now separating kvmclock and kvmclock2, and then I plan to
go to the KVM side and deprecate kvmclock2, and then finally remove
kvmclock (old) in QEMU. Separating the two features makes the process
clearer.

Continuing to use the same name equally would have silently caused the
CPUID to change on the Guest side, which would have hurt compatibility
as well.

Please refer to my elaboration on v4.5 above, where kvmclock2 is
available, it should be used in priority.
