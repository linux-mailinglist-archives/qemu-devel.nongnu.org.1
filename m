Hmm yes, it will happen, but should only happen after the main channel.

In short, qemu_savevm_state_complete_precopy_iterable() is skipped in
postcopy.  I don't yet see anywhere multifd flushes pages.  We need to
flush multifd pages before vcpu starts on dest.

As we discussed off-list, we can add an assertion in multifd recv threads
to make sure it won't touch any guest page during active postcopy.

Maybe something like:

diff --git a/migration/multifd.c b/migration/multifd.c

         if (has_data) {
+            /*

+            assert(!migration_in_postcopy());
             ret = multifd_recv_state->ops->recv(p, &local_err);
             if (ret != 0) {
                 break;

I'd suggest we try interrupt postcopy with migrate-pause, then go with
postcopy recover.  I wonder how the current series work if the network
failure will fail all the multifd iochannels, and how reconnect works.
