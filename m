QMP is for machines.

That said, I won't object to adding development & debugging aids meant
for humans as long as

1. they're marked unstable, and

2. they either add only a modest amount of output, or the additional
   output is off by default.

What exactly is a "modest amount" depends on how machines use the
command.  If they use it all the time, even going from 8KiB to 64KiB
could be too much.  If they use it just once per guest, we can afford
more waste.

In this particular case, we could add an unstable member of type ['str']
next to the int-valued bits.  For each set bit in the int, add a string
to the list.  If QEMU knows the bit, use the well-known name.  I'd omit
the common prefix, though: use "GUEST_ANNOUNCE" or "guest-announce"
instead of "VIRTIO_NET_F_GUEST_ANNOUNCE".  If QEMU doesn't know the bit,
you could use the bit's numeric value.

Recommend a separate patch, to avoid delaying this series.

Makes sense?
