lower-case the guest-memfd? since it's the name of the property?

After rethinking on it, I think we just remove the check. There is 
nothing from QEMU side to prevent such usage. It is KVM currently that 
doesn't support INIT_SHARED guest-memfd for confidential VMs.

If we change to KVM to allow it:

diff --git a/arch/x86/kvm/x86.c b/arch/x86/kvm/x86.c
index 8bb8830561d4..a658b636a9cf 100644

and remove this check in QEMU, it can actually boot a TDX guest with
fully-shared guest-memfd back'ed as shared part.

As above, I think what the patch achieves is to enable guest-memfd (with 
MMAP and INIT_SHARED) to back shared memory. And it is not conflicted 
with using another guest-memfd to back private memory.

No. The KVM stub is for the case where KVM is disable at compile time.

The kvm_enabled() check here is for the case where users use different 
accelerators other than KVM, e.g., -accel tcg.

yeah, change to "fd < 0" looks better.
