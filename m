> F. Work Presented at KVM Forum Conferences:
> ==========================================
> 
> Details of the above work have been presented at KVMForum2020 and KVMForum2023
> conferences. Slides & video are available at the links below:

> (VI) Commands Used
> ==================
> 
> A. Qemu launch commands to init the machine:
> 
>      $ qemu-system-aarch64 --enable-kvm -machine virt,gic-version=3 \
>        -cpu host -smp cpus=4,maxcpus=6 \
>        -m 300M \
>        -kernel Image \
>        -initrd rootfs.cpio.gz \
>        -append "console=ttyAMA0 root=/dev/ram rdinit=/init maxcpus=2 acpi=force" \
>        -nographic \
>        -bios QEMU_EFI.fd \
> 
> B. Hot-(un)plug related commands:
> 
>    # Hotplug a host vCPU (accel=kvm):
>      $ device_add host-arm-cpu,id=core4,core-id=4
> 
>    # Hotplug a vCPU (accel=tcg):
>      $ device_add cortex-a57-arm-cpu,id=core4,core-id=4

Since support for hotplug is disabled on TCG, remove
these two lines in v4 cover letter?

> (VIII) KNOWN ISSUES
> ===================
> 
> 1. Migration has been lightly tested but has been found working.
> 2. TCG is broken.
> 3. HVF and qtest are not supported yet.
> 4. ACPI MADT Table flags [7] MADT.GICC.Enabled and MADT.GICC.online-capable are
>     mutually exclusive, i.e., as per the change [6], a vCPU cannot be both
>     GICC.Enabled and GICC.online-capable. This means:
>        [ Link: https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3706 ]
>     a. If we have to support hot-unplug of the cold-booted vCPUs, then these MUST
>        be specified as GICC.online-capable in the MADT Table during boot by the
>        firmware/Qemu. But this requirement conflicts with the requirement to
>        support new Qemu changes with legacy OS that don't understand
>        MADT.GICC.online-capable Bit. Legacy OS during boot time will ignore this
>        bit, and hence these vCPUs will not appear on such OS. This is unexpected
>        behavior.
>     b. In case we decide to specify vCPUs as MADT.GICC.Enabled and try to unplug
>        these cold-booted vCPUs from OS (which in actuality should be blocked by
>        returning error at Qemu), then features like 'kexec' will break.
>     c. As I understand, removal of the cold-booted vCPUs is a required feature
>        and x86 world allows it.
>     d. Hence, either we need a specification change to make the MADT.GICC.Enabled
>        and MADT.GICC.online-capable Bits NOT mutually exclusive or NOT support
>        the removal of cold-booted vCPUs. In the latter case, a check can be introduced
>        to bar the users from unplugging vCPUs, which were cold-booted, using QMP
>        commands. (Needs discussion!)
>        Please check the patch part of this patch set:
>        [hw/arm/virt: Expose cold-booted CPUs as MADT GICC Enabled].
>     
>        NOTE: This is definitely not a blocker!
> 5. Code related to the notification to GICV3 about the hot(un)plug of a vCPU event
>     might need further discussion.
> 
> 
> (IX) THINGS TO DO
> =================
> 
> 1. Fix issues related to TCG/Emulation support. (Not a blocker)
> 2. Comprehensive Testing is in progress. (Positive feedback from Oracle & Ampere)
> 3. Qemu Documentation (.rst) needs to be updated.
> 4. Fix qtest, HVF Support (Future).
> 5. Update the design issue related to ACPI MADT.GICC flags discussed in known
>     issues. This might require UEFI ACPI specification change (Not a blocker).
> 6. Add ACPI _OSC 'Query' support. Only part of _OSC support exists now. (Not a blocker).
> 
> The above is *not* a complete list. Will update later!
> 
> Best regards,
> Salil.

> (X) DISCLAIMER
> ==============
> 
> This work is an attempt to present a proof-of-concept of the ARM64 vCPU hotplug
> implementation to the community. This is *not* production-level code and might
> have bugs. Comprehensive testing is being done on HiSilicon Kunpeng920 SoC,
> Oracle, and Ampere servers. We are nearing stable code and a non-RFC
> version shall be floated soon.
> 
> This work is *mostly* in the lines of the discussions that have happened in the
