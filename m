Thanks.  It'll be great to also double check colo docs (e.g. COLO-FT.txt)
is still the latest.  Another bonus if you could rewrite some into .rst and
put it under docs/devel/migration/ if that makes sense to you.

No real blocker yet, it was a problem of extra complexity, and nobody that
I was aware of is using COLO in production or even experimental environment
before I know you're using it.  I'm actually curious what's the use case in
your setup, feel free to share more if possible.  I'd love to learn about it.

If you plan to maintain COLO, please feel free to review this series:

Normally cleanup patches do not qualify into -rc category, but you can send
it out first and we can discuss in the thread on the target merge window.

Thanks,
