In fact, should we insist that 'qemu-img info XXX' refuse to accept
any control characters on any command-line filename, and that it
reject any backing file name with control characters as a malformed
qcow2 file?  For reference, we JUST fixed qemu-img info to change
qcow2 files with a claimed backing file of json:... to favor the local
file ./json:... over the potentially dangerous user-controlled
format/protocol description, so we are _already_ changing how strict
qemu-img is for 9.1, and adding one more restriction to avoid
escape-sequence madness makes sense.

Note that with:

touch $'\e[m' && qemu-img info --output=json $'\e[m'

we already escape our output, but without --output=json, we are
vulnerable to user-controlled ESC leaking through to stdout for more
than just the NBD server errors that I addressed in v1 of this patch
series.  Hence my question on whether v2 of the series should touch
more places in the code, and whether doing something like flat-out
refusing users stupid enough to embed control characters in their
filenames is a safe change this close to release.
