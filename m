So the network device already has to special case vdpa instead of using
the same code for all vhost backends? :-/

You were concerned about implementing .vhost_set_vring_enable in
vdpa_ops like my patch does. So it seems that the networking code
requires that it is not implemented?

On the other hand, for vhost-vdpa, the callback seems to be called in
exactly the right place where virtqueues need to be enabled, like for
other vhost devices.

So it's less about the granularity of .vhost_set_vring_enable, which
would just be right, but about the order in which it is called for the
different vhost_devs?

Can we influence the order in another way than just not implementing the
callback at all? I think net specific weirdness should be contained in
the net implementation and not affect generic vdpa code.

I don't actually know VDUSE very well, but that would probably make
sense.

Though for the moment, I just tried to simply attach a VDUSE device and
failed, so I'm just trying to fix the regression from your commit.

Which specific caller do you mean here?

For vdpa-dev, I don't see any problem with just passing vrings=true
unconditionally. That is clearly the least problematic order even if
another order may in theory be allowed by the spec.

For vhost_net, I don't know. As far as I am concerned, there is no
reason to change its call and it could continue to pass vrings=false.

So vhost_dev_start() seems entirely unproblematic.

The only part that changes for net is that vhost_set_vring_enable() now
does something where it didn't do anything before. If that is a problem
for vdpa based network code, maybe we can just special case vdpa there
to not call vhost_ops->vhost_set_vring_enable? (Despite its name, it's a
network specific function; it should probably be called something like
vhost_net_set_vring_enable.)

With something like the below, net shouldn't see any difference any
more, right? (Happy to add a comment before it if you write it for me.)
