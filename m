So they're all really different granularities:
    s390 - one key/physical page
    ARM MTE - one tag/16 bytes physical
    x86 - per virtual page; then a current register with 16 permission
         sets

For x86 I guess it would be easy to dump the register, and then the
values for a range of virtual addresses.
But then if you dumped a range of physical addresses on ARM MTE you'd
get hundreds times more output than for the equivalent s390.
