For me, that doesn't really make it much more appealing. Yes, we already have
an abstract class, but that has narrower impact, as there are fewer places
in which which we can trigger instantiation of an abstract class, than
where we can trigger instantiation of arbitrary objects and devices.

The conversion of the iommu code results in worse error reporting, and
doesn't handle the virtio-iommu case, and the migration problems appear
solvable without inventing a singleton interface. So this doesn't feel
like it is worth the the trouble.

NB, my view point would have been different if  'object_new' had an
"Error *errp" parameter. That would have made handling failure a
standard part of the design pattern for object construction, thus
avoiding adding asserts in the 'object_new' codepath which could be
triggered by unexpected/badly validated user input.

With regards,
Daniel
