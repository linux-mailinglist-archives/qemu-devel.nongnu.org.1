Hi Phil,

Apologies, I missed this and I just found it when preparing
now the v3 for ivshmem-flat.

I prefer 'toggle' (as you suggested initially). However, for v2,
I didn't add an API function to detect a pulse/trigger/toggle.
Instead, for v2, there are only qtest_get_irq_raised_counter() and
qtest_get_irq_lowered_counter(), as you suggested. The user can
then use these functions to create such a detector:

https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2023-11/msg03176.html

... as we do in the ivshmem-flat qtest (test_ivshmem_flat_irq_positive_pulse).

If you're ok with v2, could you please bless it? :)

oh! cool, totally missed that. I'm using it for the ivshmem-flat v3 series!
