It is a nice work indeed. I spent substantial time to work on QEMU but 
the Sphinx problem mentioned later was the only problem I encountered.

Thank you for detailed explanation. I see a few possible options in this 
situation.

Pretending as a lawyer interpreting docs/about/build-platforms.rst as a 
law, I think it is allowed to require the Internet access. It says:

So it is allowed to require a non-default runtime that is available on 
PyPI but not on Debian.

But it is also allowed to bundle a python module or to keep its version 
requirement low to help users just as we do for Meson, of course.

Another possible option is to provide a mechanism to download the 
required Python packages; users need the Internet to to prepare the 
build platform (e.g., Debian) and QEMU source code anyway, so it makes 
sense to require downloading the Python packages at the same time for 
the future offline usage.

"pip download" is probably for such a use case, and we can make sure 
that nobody get hurt by the Sphinx change or other Python dependency 
changes by wiring up it into python/scripts/mkvenv.py.

In summary, there are the following viable options:
(1) Don't bump the Sphinx version.
(2) Require the Internet access when running ./configure --enable-docs.
(3) Bundle Sphinx.
(4) Let users "pip download".

Skipping into the conclusion, I'm for (2). The other options have their 
own disadvantages:

(1) may cause intermittent failures with old Sphinx versions, which is 
too bad.
(3) is just difficult, according on your description.
(4) is nice, but requires more time and I don't think it's worthwhile to 
take the risk of old Sphinx versions until it is implemented.

In contrast, it seems (2) has the minimum risk and acceptable level of 
annoyance. The documentation is for humans, and any human using QEMU 
should have one computer with the Internet access at least. Perhaps some 
users will be forced to change the build flag to stop building the 
documentation on an offline computer and to prepare a build environment 
on an online computer, but it's acceptable I guess.

Akihiko Odaki
