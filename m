The fewer / simpler the layers we have in the execution path
of tests the better our life will be in debugging IMHO.

Having each individual test registered with meson has the
particularly strong advantage that we can make use of meson's
timeout feature to force individual tests to abort if they
hang/run too slowly, as we did when converting the iotests
to individual meson tests.

Right, avocado is providing 2 distinct things, the test execution
harness and the test framework APIs.

It could be valid to remove use of the harness but keep using
the framework APIs, especially if that's sufficient to unblock
updating to new avocado versions too ? Over the longer term
we can consider whether the framework APIs should remain or
be replaced by something else.

The meson "suites" concept is the logical equivalent of tags.
You've wired up a suite for each architecture. We could define
more suites if there are other useful criteria for filtering
tests to be run. Perhaps machine type ? "make check-pytest-arm-<machine>"

Yep, debuggability is probably the single biggest problem we face
with our tests. Simplifying the test execution harness will help
in this respect, but yeah, we must have a way to capture logs
of stuff executed.
