It seems this can be a separate new bug.. possible introduced in the same
commit since 8.0.  I will post a patch for this soon.

One more thing to mention is I am aware Nicholas & Phil also hit some s390
tcg issues, and just recently there got a fix landed, I'm suspecting that
could also be relevant. See:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20240312201458.79532-1-philmd@linaro.org/
03bfc2188f physmem: Fix migration dirty bitmap coherency with TCG memory access

I would suspect this issue reproduces easier before this.  I think Nicholas
also mentioned there can be other bug floating around:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/CZSDDVZW4G3L.6CV89ZRMQK9G@wheely/

Let me add all into this loop.

Thanks,
