Sounds good to me.

I think so, too.

Yes.

I'm not a fan of schema files with nothing but includes, like
accelerator.json.  But the alternative here would be putting its
contents into qapi-schema.json, which I really don't like, or keeping
the KVM contents there instead of in a separate kvm.json, which would
interfere with tracking maintainers in the MAINTAINERS file.

You're welcome!
