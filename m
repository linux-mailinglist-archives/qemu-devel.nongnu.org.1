I'm not sure if the file actually goes away. It looks like the internal
state of the device changes and QEMU receives a "no device"
response in usb_host_req_complete_data. However, the file
remains in place. At least I don't see any changes in udevadm
monitor or inotifywait aside from attribute modifications.

After resuming from suspend, the device doesn't work on either
host or guest. Probably the device stays with a detached kernel
driver since QEMU can't reattach it after receiving the "no device"
error. Adding such devices to the hotplug watchlist causes QEMU
to reopen them the same way it does for devices specified by
vendorid and productid or hostport.

The reason bus+addr devices aren't currently added to that list is well
explained in commit e058fa2dd599ccc780d334558be9c1d155222b80.
A special case was made because the device address changes every
time it's replugged. However, it turns out that it doesn't change after
a suspend/resume cycle so adding them to the list allows them to
keep working after resume.

I haven't had a chance to test it with libvirt though.
