Yep. I am thinking however that because 3.9 is soon to be EOL this autumn,
it may become reasonable to start requiring newer Python interpreters for
this platform as well. They *are* available.

I won't do it without a reason, but I think this may be a reasonable policy
moving forward- If your platform is otherwise supported by our policy but
ships a version of Python from more than five years ago (aka is EOL
upstream), you *may* be required to install a newer, optional version (if
and only if one is reasonably available from official distro repositories.)

In general, this should have little to no impact except that isolated,
offline builds (a la rpmbuild) may fail to produce documentation unless
special considerations are taken for the build environment (namely, sphinx
needs to be loaded for the newer interpreter).

I think this is a reasonable compromise. If distributions want to package
bleeding edge QEMU with five-years-old dependencies, they can expect to
face *some* hurdles, and figuring out how to get sphinx as a builddep to
build an optional component is not entirely unreasonable.

TLDR - I pledge to support any platform covered by our promise for
building, but testing and documentation *requires* a non-EOL interpreter.
This should have little to no effect for developers or users building from
source or git, but has minor drawbacks for downstream maintainers of
enterprise distributions that may attempt to backport bleeding edge QEMU
versions.

Yep, this tool was made to show the platform defaults only for now. Maybe
I'll add a "show first party backports" flag in the future, if anyone more
than just my own personal self would find that useful. (Speak up if so.)

With us until 26.04, in about 0.75 years. This seems like a reasonable new
minimum if we wanted to increase it, though that does artificially drop
support for RHEL9/CentOS stream building documentation from source under
rpmbuild.

(FWIW I probably can continue to support sphinx 3.x for a little while, the
code is gross but it does appear functional. The only thing we *need* to do
is bump the preferred version, I think. This support generally comes at the
expense of type checking support for the docs code, as it's so gross I
couldn't get it to work from 3.x to 8.x inclusive.)

Sounds good! I was just taking care to be diligent about which repositories
this tool compiled info from in order to give a very honest snapshot. I
made careful note of any "weird" ones that may or may not be considered
platform standards.

Yep, just formally stating that not only do we have a workaround, but we
may have run afoul of the five year window regardless.

Hopefully a non-issue once 16 ships.

(I am of course glad it works anyway!)

Just interesting to note that OpenSUSE would already have the same problems
CentOS 9 might in the near future: optional Python upgrade is available,
but distro-packaged Sphinx upgrade may not be.

Yes, fair enough.=C2=A0 Ubuntu 22.04 came out more recently than CentOS <br=

Stream 9, after all, and its base distribution is more up to date than <br>

&gt; (6) &quot;ports&quot; collections (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD/pkgsrc_cur=
rent,<br>
&gt; Homebrew and MacPorts) do not necessarily have the concept of a<br>
&gt; platform default Python interpreter version, but other packages in the=
<br>
&gt; collection can be used as a heuristic to determine which one is best<b=
r>
&gt; suited.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; For instance, FreeBSD and NetBSD only ship pip et al for a single<br>
&gt; interpreter version.<br>
&gt; OpenBSD has a symbolic &quot;python3&quot; package that installs a spe=
cific<br>
&gt; version. Homebrew has a &quot;python3&quot; alias that chooses a speci=
fic Python<br>
&gt; interpreter version. MacPorts similarly has a symbolic &quot;py-setupt=
ools&quot;<br>
&gt; package that will choose a specific interpreter version.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; These are used as heuristics to determine a &quot;de-facto&quot; defau=
lt for the<br>
&gt; ports collection platforms.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; -<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; That&#39;s all for now. I will publish the script to the list later,<b=
r>
&gt; though I have no intention of cleaning it up for inclusion in our<br>
&gt; tree. When I send it, bookmark the email if you&#39;d like to try usin=
g<br>
&gt; this for other purposes or running it for yourself. Maybe I will throw=
<br>
&gt; it up on my personal GitLab in case it is useful to other subsystem<br=
>
&gt; maintainers in the future. The filtering code is a little messy, but<b=
r>
&gt; it got the job done and should be reasonably straightforward to make<b=
r>
&gt; sense of at a glance. It uses only the &#39;requests&#39; library as a=
 third<br>
&gt; party dependency.<br>
