I get it now, thank you!

I see. Have you compared the HCAs v.s. the modern NICs?  Now NICs can
achieve similar performance from their spec as I said; I am not sure how
they perform in real life, but maybe worth trying.  I only tried 100G nic
and I rem I can hit 70+Gbps with multifd migrations at peak bandwidth.
Have you tried that before?

Note that here I didn't want to compare the performance between the two and
find a winner.  The issue we're facing now is we have the RDMA migration
now mostly having its own path all over the place, while the rest protocols
(socket, fd, file, etc.) all share the rest.

Then, _if_ modern NICs can work similarly v.s. rdma, I don't yet see a good
reason to keep it.  It could be that technology just improved so we can use
less code to do as good.  It's a good news to help QEMU evolve by dropping
unused code.

For some details there on the rdma complications for migration:

  (1) RDMA is the only protocol that doesn't yet support QIOChannel, while
      migration uses QIOChannels mostly everywhere now.. e.g. in multifd,
      it means it won't easily support any new things using QIOChannels.

  (2) RDMA is the only protocol that mostly hard-coded everywhere in the
      RAM migrations, polluting the core logic with much more code
      internally to support this protocol.

For (1), see migrate_fd_connect() from rdma_start_outgoing_migration().
While the rest protocols all go via migration_channel_connect().

For (2), see all the "rdma_*" functions in migration/ram.c, where I don't
think it's common to a protocol - most of the rest protocols don't need
those hard-coded stuff.  migration/rdma.c has 4000+ LOC for these stuff,
while to do a not-so-fair comparison, migration/fd.c only has <100 LOC.

Then, we found we don't even know who's using it.

I hope I explained why people started this idea, and also why I think that
makes sense at least to me.

See tests/qtest/migration-test.c.  We put most of our migration tests
there and that's covered in CI.

I think one major issue is CI systems don't normally have rdma devices.
Can rdma migration test be carried out without a real hardware?

Thanks for all these inputs so far.  These can help us make a wiser and
clearer step no matter which way we choose.
