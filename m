I know that, but I'm saying QEMU should not be doing *any* generic cleanup
of passed in FDs at any point. 

A passed in FD should be taken by whatever part of the QEMU configuration
is told to use it when needed, and this takes responsibility for closing
it. If nothing is told to use the fdset /yet/, then it should stay in the
fdset untouched for later use.

If an application accidentally passes in a FD that it doesn't reference
in any configuration, that's simply a application bug to fix. QEMU does
not need to secondguess the app's intent and decide to arbitrarily close
it.

With regards,
Daniel
