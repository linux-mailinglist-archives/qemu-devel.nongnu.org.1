OK. I see how you want to use the wiki for the TODO ideas and it makes
sense for mid/long term projects which are not mature enough to be
mentioned in the official docs. That said, I think we should mention
not supported features, incomplete modelling, etc. in the official docs,
which is a bit different than a TODO, I agree.

We also have a [feature request] label under gitlab and some issues are
tagged with it. I wonder how we can consolidate the 3 sources : wiki,
gitlab, https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/

Thanks,

C.
