Nice! Yeah, contributing to an OSS project can be intimidating at first=2E=

Well, the imx8mp-flexcan branch is a moving target and currently exists as=
 a proof of concept=2E Once this series is merged, I would like to integrat=
e this series' FlexCAN functionality into imx8mp, even if the real controll=

Let's keep the discussion on the list=2E While there is some truth to my b=
ranches I'd prefer to stick to the review process and only discuss topics r=
aised here=2E I'll provide my feedback as soon as I find time for it=2E

Best regards,
Bernhard
