The convenience of being able to use cargo dependencies without
special QEMU meson build system effort seems worth the overhead of
meson<->cargo<->rustc to me. There is a blog post that explores using
cargo crates using meson's wrap dependencies here, and it seems like
extra work:
https://coaxion.net/blog/2023/04/building-a-gstreamer-plugin-in-rust-with-meson-instead-of-cargo/

It's possible to use just meson today, but I don't think it's
practical when using cargo dependencies.

What advantages does a custom build of std bring?

Fedora and Debian want Rust applications to use distro-packaged
crates. No vendoring and no crates.io online access. It's a bit of a
pain because Rust developers need to make sure their code works with
whatever version of crates Fedora and Debian provide.

The `cargo vendor` command makes it easy for anyone wishing to collect
the required dependencies for offline builds (something I've used for
CentOS builds where vendoring is allowed).

I suggest not vendoring packages in qemu.git. Users can still run
`cargo vendor` for easy offline builds.

Okay, cool!
