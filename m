I could add error/warn variants that are noop in case qtest is
enabled. It would, however, lead to this pattern which is discouraged by
the error.h documentation (+Cc Markus for advice):

before:
    if (!dinfo && !qtest_enabled()) {
        error_report("A flash image must be given with the "
                     "'pflash' parameter");
        exit(1);
    }

after:
    if (!dinfo) {
        error_report_noqtest(&error_fatal,
                             "A flash image must be given with the "
                             "'pflash' parameter");
    }

For both error/warn, we'd reduce the amount of qtest_enabled() to only
the special cases not related to printing. We'd remove ~35/83 instances,
not counting the 7 printfs.
