That's how I got some parts I'm maintainer of now. :-)

There's isapc but you can't attach PCI card to that. It seems according to 
-machine pc,help that there's a PIC=<OnOffAuto> option but no similar for 
APIC. Maybe that could be added but not sure it would work. (Adding 
Bernhard to cc to quickly pass on the potato.)
