That is still going to be slower than running the migration non-live,
because the guest will be dirtying memory that needs to be transferred.
Even if we have the elevated bandwidth limit that's going to have a
CPU cost which will hurt running time in CI where alot is running in
parallel.

IMHO this patch is beneficial regardless.

The next patch might be redundant though.
