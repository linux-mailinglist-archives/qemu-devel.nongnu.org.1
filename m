It's served the community for quite a while! Uniting it with its younger
cousins seems correct, so I'll propose the move in the forthcoming RFC.

Thanks for catching this early! I wrongly assumed a move to contrib/
would necessitate the creation of a dedicated section.

If we move vhost-user-bridge to contrib/vhost-user-bridge/, then it'll
automatically be covered by MAINTAINERS; otherwise, I could revise the
RFC to add it with its current location and this functional test as
individual files under the vhost-user section instead.

Thanks for the insight! I figured connecting to example.org would
provide a more comprehensive log but was concerned about introducing
such an external dependency to the test; I'm glad we could forgo it by
pinging the slirp-assigned gateway obtained by udhcpc instead.
