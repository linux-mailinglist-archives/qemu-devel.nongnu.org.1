Yes, the monitor has the same conceptual problem, and this caused problems
for libvirt starting QEMU for many years.

With the busy wait you risk looping forever if the child (target) QEMU
already exited for some reason without ever creating the socket. You
can mitigate this by using 'kill($PID, 0)' in the loop and looking
for -ERSCH, but this only works if you know the pid involved.


One option is to use 'daemonize' such that when the parent sees the initial
QEMU process leader exit, the parent has a guarantee that the daemonized
QEMU already has the UNIX listener open, and any failure indicates QEMU
already quit.


The other option is to use FD passing such that QEMU is not responsible
for opening the listener socket - it gets passed a pre-opened listener
FD, so the parent has a guarantee it can successfull connect immediately
and any failure indicates QEMU already quit.


For the tests, passing a pre-opened UNIX socket FD could work, but I'm
still curious why this is only a problem for the CPR tests, and not
the other migration tests which don't use 'defer'. What has made CPR
special to expose a race ?

With regards,
Daniel
