I might be interested in debugging some i8086 stuff for my Venix/86
emulation
project.

I'm curious, though. I see special cases just for EIP being returned as (CS
<< 4):EIP
and similar for ESP being just (SS << 4):SP. What does the debugger do,
though,
for other cases where you need segment:offset addresses? Does it translate
properly
behind the scenes in ways it doesn't do for ESP/EIP or do you have to
examine those
addresses by hand as well? If I'm chasing a linked list with 16-bit
addresses that assume
a particular DS, how does that work?

It is commonly known that Qemu does not handle real/16-bit mode well with <=

which involve GDB scripts to make debugging less painful.<br>
<br>

1) Returning the correct CPU mode as &quot;i8086&quot; or &quot;i386&quot; =
depending on the <br>
current CPU mode (on x86_gdb_arch_name), instead of always returning <br>
&quot;i386&quot;.<br>
<br>
2) Translating segmented memory to linear if in real mode, i.e., <br>
returning CS*0x10+EIP instead of just EIP, and similarly for ESP, etc.<br>

your thoughts first. I understand that Bochs and similar tools have <br>
sufficiently good debuggers, but it would be interesting if Qemu had some <=

I also acknowledge that my solution might not help in all scenarios, such <=

as CPU mode switches, so its effectiveness would be limited.<br>
