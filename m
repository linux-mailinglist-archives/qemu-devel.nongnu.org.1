The patch is mostly ok, the general principles are sound.

A few things:

Can you put the patch inline in the email instead of attaching it?  In
general, it is hard to deal with attachments when commenting on things.
Use git-send-email or git-format-patch or something like that.  You can
look in the Linux kernel docs for how to do this.

I could not find a check on the lan.channel value to make sure it is in
range and doesn't conflict with an existing channel.  If a check is not
there it needs to be done.

I would like to keep the behavior as close as possible to the current
behavior.  If a channel is not defined, get_lan_config() and
set_lan_config() should return the same value as if the command was not
defined.  I think get_channel_access() is ok as it is.

You need to add documentation in qemu-options.hx.

Can you copy Cornelia Huck <cornelia.huck@de.ibm.com> on the next
version?  The IBM people are the biggest users of the ipmi code,
and I don't want this to catch them off guard.

If the patch gets too big, feel free to split it into multiple parts.

Thanks,

-corey

But ipmi-bmc-sim is more light-weight and easier to set up. So I think it still has some value in implementing LAN config for ipmi-bmc-sim . Could you please share your views?

However, QEMU internal BMC simulator device (`ipmi-bmc-sim`) does not support retrieving LAN configs from it. I have to implement two IPMI commands so that the device can now work with ipmitool. The LAN config values are faked, but for testing purposes this is not a problem. I believe other people may also have the same need, so it's worth getting merged upstream.

The device then reads the file and returns those values as LAN configs. This is similar to sdrfile for sensor data and frudatafile for FRU data.
