I see.  Do you know how many of them would be important memory leaks that
we should fix immediately?

I mean, we have known memory leaks in QEMU in many places I assume.  I am
curious how important this problem is, and whether such would justify a
memory API change that is not reaching a quorum state (and, imho, add
complexity to memory core and of course that spreads to x86 too even if it
was not affected) to be merged.  Or perhaps we can fix the important ones
first from the device model directly instead.

It's not new to me that QEMU can leave some memory allocated for the whole
lifecycle of the process.  E.g. I just worked on something for migration
that we could have UAF on migration object.  I tried to provide a core fix
via QOM singleton but unfortunately that didn't yet got accepted, so
migration still face such UAF.  It was not accepted because of some reasons
and reviewer concerns, so I suppose that's fair that until we reach a
consensus on an acceptable and clean general solution, we leave that issue
be there if it's a corner case anyway - in migration that was the case.

For this specific case, my current understanding is the important leaks are
where it can e.g. get devices frequently plugged and unplugged with can
cause QEMU to bloat till host OOM.  For those cases I wonder whether (even
if we want to provide a global sulution... but while before it settles..)
we could fix them first by correctly detach the subregions just like what
x86 does.

Thanks,
