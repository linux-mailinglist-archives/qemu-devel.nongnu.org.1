I might be missing something here, but since this is not for runtime,
I don’t quite understand the need to reset the control registers.

Personally, I would lean towards keeping the current logic and instead
adjusting patch 6/7 to reset the global registers.  This is just my
view, and please don’t feel obligated to follow it.
