This would leave us with:

- $profile=off => disable all extensions. Let users hit themselves in the foot if they
don't enable any other extensions. Note that disabling a profile and enabling extensions
on top of it is very sensitive to left-to-right ordering, so it would be good to have
a way to enforce this ordering somehow (feature groups always first);

- $profile=on => only valid for generic CPUs;

- $profile=check -> valid for all CPUs, would only check if the CPU implements the profile.


I think this is fine. Drew, care to weight in?
