My understanding is that `format=3Dvvfat,size=3DxxxM` results in a valid
EndLBA. Is that enough to make a valid partition table ?
However, I'm still getting the corrupted error without `no-mbr`.
Though, the warning is gone too (compared to `format=3Draw,size=3Dxxx`).
So this is something else QNX doesn't like...

Something weird if just noticed, the disk CHS values are changed when
passing `no-mbr`
  | (host) $ qemu-system-aarch64 -drive
file=3Dfat:rw:<host_folder>:format=3Dvvfat,size=3D128M
  | (QEMU) # fdisk -l /dev/mmcblk1
  | Disk /dev/mmcblk1: 128 MB, 134217728 bytes, 262144 sectors
  | 1024 cylinders, 8 heads, 32 sectors/track
  |
  | (host) $ qemu-system-aarch64 -drive
file=3Dfat:rw:no-mbr:<host_folder>:format=3Dvvfat,size=3D128M
  | (QEMU) # fdisk -l /dev/mmcblk1
  | Disk /dev/mmcblk1: 128 MB, 134217728 bytes, 262144 sectors
  | 4096 cylinders, 4 heads, 16 sectors/track

Not sure if it could be related.

Yes and the main reason for that is because I don't know how to
retrieve the size given to "raw" within `vvfat_open`.
My understanding is that raw-format.c is suppressing that option,
through `qemu_opts_del` in `raw_read_options`, before calling its
block childs (here vvfat). Hence, it assumes the default size 512M.
