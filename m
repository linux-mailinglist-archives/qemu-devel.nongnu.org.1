Right, in the scsi-disk case, we probably do want to consider it a
host-side error because the guest can't see or influence what happens on
the backend.

I can change the commit message accordingly.

Apparently both oVirt and Kubevirt unconditionally use the stop policy,
so I'm afraid in this case we must acknowledge that our expectations
don't match reality.

If I understand correctly, not having a pr-manager could mean that QEMU
itself is sufficiently privileged and then the same logic would apply.

But even if it means that we can't change any persistent reservations
from the VM, what use would stopping the VM be? You would run into the
exact case I'm describing in the commit message: You try to resume the
VM and it immediately stops again because the request still doesn't get
through. Or do you expect the host admin to take some manual action
then?

And what would you do about the Windows cluster validation case that
intentionally sends a request which reservations don't and shouldn't
allow? There is nothing on the host side to fix there. The guest is only
happy when it gets an error back.

Not sure why the initialiser was added in the first place, but yes, I
can do that.
