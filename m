kinds of. Our new hardware is RDMA capable, we can configure it to run
in "rdma" transport or "tcp"
it is more straight comparison,
When run "rdma" transport, RoCE is involved, eg the
rdma-core/ibverbs/rdmacm/vendor verbs driver are used.

Yes, the simple setup can be just two hosts directly connected. This remind=
 me,
I may also able to find a test setup with 100 G nic in lab, will keep
you posted.
