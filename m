The usefulness of the conditions to non-C languages may well
vary depended on intended use case.

If I'm writing a mgmt app that can talk to QEMU, and I want
to be able to talk to both x86 and s390 system emulators,
I am unlikely to want the language bindings to omit features
based on TARGET_xxx conditions. I won't want a separate API
for each QEMU arch target, I'll want one API for all arches.

Expanding this further, if I'm writing a mgmt app to talk
to QEMU 9.2.0, I am also unlikely to want the language
bindings to omit features based on CONFIG_xxxx conditions,
because I likely want to talk to a QEMU 9.2.0 built by any
OS distro, each of which may have chosen a different set
of --enable flags for configure, and thus having different
CONFIG_xxx conditions.

TL;DR: in terms of code generation, the prime use case for
conditionally generated code is for QEMU's own internal usage.
For QMP bindings generated for 3rd party app usage, the use
of conditions in generation feels like a niche requirment at
best.

IMHO the code for any public facing API derived from QMP
schema should be invariant for any given QEMU release.

With regards,
Daniel
