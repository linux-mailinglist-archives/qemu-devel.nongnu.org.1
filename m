The existing text is about "AI code generators".  However, the "most
notably LLMs" that follows it could lead readers to believe it's about
more than just code generation, because LLMs are in fact used for more.
I figure this is your concern.

We could instead start wide, then narrow the focus to code generation.
Here's my try:

  The increasing prevalence of AI-assisted software development results
  in a number of difficult legal questions and risks for software
  projects, including QEMU.  Of particular concern is code generated by
  `Large Language Models
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model>`__ (LLMs).

If we want to mention uses of AI we consider okay, I'd do so further
down, to not distract from the main point here.  Perhaps:

  The QEMU project thus requires that contributors refrain from using AI co=
de
  generators on patches intended to be submitted to the project, and will
  decline any contribution if use of AI is either known or suspected.

  This policy does not apply to other uses of AI, such as researching APIs =
or
  algorithms, static analysis, or debugging.

  Examples of tools impacted by this policy includes both GitHub's CoPilot,
  OpenAI's ChatGPT, and Meta's Code Llama, amongst many others which are le=
ss
  well known.

The paragraph in the middle is new, the other two are unchanged.

Thoughts?
