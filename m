I'm not a list admin, but I have some observations below

I can see patches arriving in my INBOX via qemu-devel from salil.mehta@opnsrc.net
but no patches from salil.mehta@huawei.com

I do see some (non-patch) emails from salil.mehta@huawei.com, but the
mailing list is re-writing this From address for DMARC countermeasures

 Salil Mehta via <qemu-devel@nongnu.org>


Recapping mail delivery policies, DMARC requires a pass for *either*
SPF or DKIM checks.

SPF checks will always fail for mails forwarded via any mailing list.

DKIM checks should still succeed *provided* the mailing list does not
modify the message content, or certain headers. QEMU mailing list
behaves in this respect generally, and applies countermeasures when
appropriate.

I see no  DKIM records huawei.com, but I do see SPF records.

This guarantees DMARC fail for any @huawei.com sender using any mailing
list, however, the @huawei.com DMARC policy is only set to 'quarantine'.

That should not block delivery to list subscribers, merely suggest
that MTAs put the mails in the Spam/Junk folder *if* DMARC fails.

mailam is cautious and thus applying DMARC countermeasures to huawei.com
addresses due to he missing DKIM records, in order to reduce the chance
that the mails end up in Spam/Junk folders for list subscribers.


This does not explain why messages might never appear in the list to
begin with though.

It is notable, however, that messages from salil.mehta@huawei.com
do arrive if they are non-patch mails. Presumably those are via a
normal email client 

I wonder how Salil is sending patches ? Some tool like git send-email
or git-publish ?

If so I then wonder if the tool is NOT correctly configured to use an
official huawei.com outbound SMTP relay ?

While you can have git send-email deliver directly to lists.nongnu.org,
the huawei.com SPF policy will almost certainly result in the mails
getting either rejected or dropped, *UNLESS* they are relayed via one
of the officially designated huawei.com SMTP relays.

In terms of mails from Vishnu, I see nothing in my INBOX from Vishnu.

The mail quoted below has a From address of vishnu@amperemail.onmicrosoft.com,
while people seem to sending to/cc for vishnu@os.amperecomputing.com

Is that From address correct ? It seems like the latter is more likely to be
the canonical address for Ampere accounts.

If not, perhaps that is triggering some rule that discards the mails when
sending is amperemail.onmicrosoft.com
