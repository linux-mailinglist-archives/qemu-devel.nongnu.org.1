Not sure if you've seen
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240723072004.1470688-1-shahuang@redhat.com/,
which aims to make aa64pfr1 writable by userspace -- but still needs
special handling for MTE. (That series also masks out MTEX and MTE_frac
because the Linux kernel does not yet handle them; might become relevant
if we want to support it from QEMU at some time in the future, but then
the command line would also need some thought.)

I fear that we'll be stuck with special handling for the MTE bits in
aa64pfr1 because the kernel will not want to break its userspace API.
