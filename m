Above rule won't stop the supported platforms to still run the QEMU
binaries, am I right?  Especially if it's a serious user the VMs should
always be invoked with an old machine type, and that shouldn't be impacted,
as the old machines should simply don't support such new kernel feature.

The payoff here is only about when the user tries to start the VM using the
default / latest machine type.  Then with above rule it should fail clearly
on what is required to turn OFF so as to boot that VM.

Then the user has two options: turn that feature OFF manually, or switch to
an old machine type.

This is all still based on the fact that we do plan to keep that OFF for a
while.  So if we think "a few years" is too long, one option is we set it
to ON after e.g. 1-2 years so it's in the middle ground where some such
new users will fail booting the VM on old hosts, but it'll start to benefit
whoever runs the same on a new host.

So far I think it's not a major deal, especially considering that this so
far looks like the easiest and (still looks to me..) workable solution to
make migration always work, IMHO more important to serious VM users.

I'm definitely open to other options or suggestions if there is.  I just
don't see anything yet that is easily applicable..

Thanks,
