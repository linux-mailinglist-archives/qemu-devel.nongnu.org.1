Additionally it requires qemu to run in dom0, while in general Xen allows
to run backends in less privileged "driver domains", which are usually not
allowed to perform foreign mappings.

And it allows to run the virtio backend in a less privileged VM.

Those would either need to use grant-copy hypercalls, or they'd need to map,
read/write, unmap.

It would be a _lot_ slower, unless virtio-iommu and grants are both modified
to match. I have looked into that, but the needed effort is rather large. At
the last Xen summit I have suggested to introduce a new grant format which
would work more like a normal page table structure. Using the same format
for virtio-iommu would allow to avoid the additional bounces between qemu and
the guest (and in fact that was one of the motivations to suggest the new
grant format).
