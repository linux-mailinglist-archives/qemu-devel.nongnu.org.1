PRO rename: the command's tie to S390 is them immediately obvious, which
may be useful when the command becomes available in qemu-systems capable
of running other targets.

CON rename: users need to adapt.

What are the users?  Not libvirt, as far as I can tell.

That's going to happen whether we rename the commands or not.

docs/devel/qapi-code-gen.rst:

    Names beginning with ``x-`` used to signify "experimental".  This
    convention has been replaced by special feature "unstable".

Feature "unstable" is what makes something unstable, and is what
machines should check.

An "x-" prefix may still be useful for humans.  Machines should *not*
key on the prefix.  It's unreliable anyway: InputBarrierProperties
member @x-origin is stable despite it's name.  Renames to gain or lose
the prefix may or may not be worth the bother.

Making an existing part of the interface unstable should be treated
similar to deprecating it: we keep it stable for at least the
deprecation period.  Not written policy, because we didn't consider such
changes when we documented our deprecation policy in
docs/about/deprecated.rst.

Alternative path to a renamed command (*if* we want that):

1. Make it unstable.

2. But keep it stable for two releases.

3. Rename.
