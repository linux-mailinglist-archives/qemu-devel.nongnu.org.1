Yes, I think it is clearer. Thanks for fixing these. I could figure this 
out despite the errors and I've used multiple named gpios for vt82c686 and 
mv64361 before, I just forgot how these functions work. Making the docs 
less confusing helps, for quick reference and especially newcomers who try 
to use this for the first time.
