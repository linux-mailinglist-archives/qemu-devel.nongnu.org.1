When introducing DM_MPATH_PROBE_PATHS, we already anticipated that
dm-multipath devices might be suspended for a short time when the DM
tables are reloaded and that they return -EAGAIN in this case. The
behaviour promised in the comment wasn't actually implemented, though:
We don't get SG_IO_MAX_RETRIES in practice, because after the first
1ms sleep, DM_MPATH_PROBE_PATHS is called and if that still fails with
-EAGAIN, we error out immediately without any retry.

However, meanwhile it has also turned out that libmpathpersist (which is
used by qemu-pr-helper) may need to perform more complex recovery
operations to get reservations back to expected state if a path failure
happened in the middle of a PR operation. In this case, the device is
suspended for a longer time compared to the case we originally expected.

This patch changes hdev_co_ioctl() to treat -EAGAIN separately so that
it doesn't result in an immediate failure if the device is suspended for
more than 1ms, and moves to incremental backoff to cover both quick and
slow cases without excessive delays.
