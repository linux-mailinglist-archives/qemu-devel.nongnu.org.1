The node type points and missing descriptor applying equally to generic
initiators. I'll add a couple of patches cleaning that up as well as 
fixing them up for generic ports.

For the exit(1) that was copying other similar locations. I don't
mind changing it though if something else is preferred.

Given tight timescales (and I was away for a few days which didn't
help), I'll send out a v6 with changes as below.

This is far from the first version (which Markus really didn't like ;)
It is really easy to draw as a sequence of diagrams and really tricky
to put in text!  Not so easy to get the kernel code right either
as it turns out but that's another story.

Perhaps if I add something to the end to say what you do with it
that might help?

"To get the full path latency, from CPU to CXL attached DRAM on a type 3
 CXL device:  Add the latency from CPU to Generic Port (from HMAT indexed
 via the the node ID in this SRAT structure) to that for CXL bus links, the
 latency across intermediate switches and from the EP port to the
 actual memory.  Bandwidth is more complex as there may be interleaving
 across multiple devices and shared links in the path."
