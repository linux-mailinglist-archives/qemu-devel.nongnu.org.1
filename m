Right, that's why I was thinking whether we should just always be on the
safe side, even if I just replied in the other email to Akihiko, that we do
have the option to make this more aggresive by turning those to ON after
even 1-2 years or even less.. and we have control of how aggressive this
can be.

The feature is always available since the 1st day, right?  We just need the
user to opt-in, by specifying ON in the cmdline.

That'll be my take on this that QEMU's default VM setup should be always
bootable, migratable, and so on.  Then user opt-in on stuff like this one,
where there's implication on the ABIs.  The "user" can also include
Libvirt.  I mean when something is really important, Libvirt should, IMHO,
opt-in by treating that similarly like many cpu properties, and by probing
the host first.

IIUC there aren't a lot of things like that (part of guest ABI & host
kernel / HW dependent), am I right?  Otherwise I would expect more failures
like this one, but it isn't as much as that yet.  IIUC it means the efforts
to make Libvirt get involved should be hopefully under control too.  The
worst case is Libvirt doesn't auto-on it, but again the user should always
have the option to turn it on when it's necessary.
