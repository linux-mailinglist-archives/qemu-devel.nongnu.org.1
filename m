I think it's not because TLS channels don't send magic, but TLS channels
are not prone to ordering issues.

In general, I'm not convinced we need to check names of iochannels.

Have we debugged the crash? I'm not saying we should go with this, but
crash isn't a reason to not choose a design.

No this is not.  As I mentioned tons of times.. copying page in socket
buffers directly into guest page during vcpus running / postcopy is a very
hard to debug issue.  If it's possible to happen, the design is flawed.

I don't think passing the unit tests prove the series is correct and should
be merged. We need to understand how it work, or we can't merge it.

I feel very frustrated multiple times that you seem to want to ignore what
I comment.  I don't know why you rush to repost things.

After a 2nd thought, I think maybe multifd flush and sync could work on src
side indeed, because when flush and sync there'll be a message
(MULTIFD_FLUSH) on main channel and that should order against the rest
postcopy messages that will also be sent on the main channel (if we do
multifd flush before all the postcopy processes).  Then it should guarantee
when postcopy starts on dest, dest multifd recv threads flushed all
messages, and no multifd message will arrive anymore.

But again we should guard it with an assert() in recv threads if you want
to postpone recycling of multifd threads, just to double check no outliers
we overlooked.

When proposing the patches you need to justify the design first before
anything.  Please evaluate above, these things are critical to appear in
either code comments or commit messages. Please digest everything before
reposting.

Thanks,
