It's not, and I've already demonstrated that real hardware is consistent
with the fix in this patch.

Please check your tone.

&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Reading the spec carefully, a CBP set to 0 should always mean=
 the zero-length buffer case (or that all bytes have been transferred, so t=

&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can see the argument for &quot;we should treat all cbp =3D=

&gt;&gt; zero-length buffer, not just cbp =3D=3D be =3D=3D 0&quot;.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Table 4-2 is the correct reference, and this part is clear. I=
t&#39;s the part you quoted. &quot;Contains the physical address of the nex=
t memory location that will be accessed for transfer to/from the endpoint. =
A value of 0 indicates a zero-length data packet or that all bytes have bee=
n transferred.&quot;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Table 4-2 has this additional nugget that may be confusingly =
worded, for BufferEnd: &quot;Contains physical address of the last byte in =
the buffer for this TD&quot;<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Mmm, but for a zero length buffer there is no &quot;last byte&quot=
; to<br>
&gt;&gt; have this be the physical address of.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; And here&#39;s an example buffer of length 0 -- you probably =
already know what I&#39;m going to do here:<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; char buf[0];<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; char * CurrentBufferPointer =3D &amp;buf[0];<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; char * BufferEnd =3D &amp;buf[-1]; // &quot;address of the la=

&gt;&gt; &gt; // The OHCI Host Controller than advances CurrentBufferPointe=

&gt;&gt; &gt; // After the transfer:<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; // CurrentBufferPointer =3D &amp;buf[0];<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; // BufferEnd =3D &amp;buf[-1];<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Right, but why do you think this is valid, rather than<br>
&gt;&gt; being a guest software bug? My reading of the spec is that it&#39;=
s<br>
&gt;&gt; pretty clear about how to say &quot;zero length buffer&quot;, and =
this<br>
&gt;&gt; isn&#39;t it.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Is there some real-world guest OS that programs the OHCI<br>
&gt;&gt; controller this way that we&#39;re trying to accommodate?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; qemu versions 4.2 and before allowed this behavior.<br>
<br>
So? That might just mean we had a bug and we fixed it.<br>
4.2 is a very old version of QEMU and nobody seems to have<br>
complained in the four years since we released 5.0 about this,<br>
which suggests that generally guest OS drivers don&#39;t try<br>
to send zero-length buffers in this way.<br>
<br>
&gt; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s valid to ask for a *popular* guest OS as a =
proof-of-concept because I&#39;m not an expert on those.<br>
<br>
I didn&#39;t ask for &quot;popular&quot;; I asked for &quot;real-world&quot=
;.<br>
What is the actual guest code you&#39;re running that falls over<br>
because of the behaviour change?<br>
<br>
More generally, why do you want this behaviour to be<br>
changed? Reasonable reasons might include:<br>
=C2=A0* we&#39;re out of spec based on reading the documentation<br>
=C2=A0* you&#39;re trying to run some old Windows VM/QNX/etc image,<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0and it doesn&#39;t work any more<br>

<br>

=C2=A0* something somebody wrote and only tested on QEMU happens to<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0assume the old behaviour rather than following the hw spec<br>
