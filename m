Ah, now I remember!

Possible minimally invasive improvement here:

* Reject @tls-hostname and @tls-authz when the value of @tls-creds means
  "TLS is off".

* When @tls-set-creds get set to a value that means "TLS is off",
  @tls-hostname and @tls-authz get unset.

This could break applications.  I'm not at all sure the slight reduction
in ugliness would be worth the risk.

I do not mean to discourage pursuing your RFC!  The TLS configuration is
ugly and confusing to use internally.  Getting that streamlined would be
nice.

First: one mess at a time is commonly the sensible approach.

Second: I'm not sure attempts to make the existing migration
configuration interfaces somewhat less ugly and confusing are
worthwhile.

I rarely advocate starting over just because something is ugly.
However, migration configuration is not only ugly; its use of global
state feels fundamentally misguided to me.  Evidence: the surprising
side effects on savevm Daniel mentioned.  I'll add: when a management
application connects to an existing QEMU, it needs to laboriously set
the entire global migration configuration state, or else rely on unsound
assumptions.  Complete non-problem when the entire configuration is
passed to the command, like we do elsewhere.

As far as I remember: to minimize last minute churn, and to not
complicate a future re-sharing.

We're consistently inconsistent ;)
