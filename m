* Not a hidden assumption, but it is an observation that 'main' and
'multifd' channels are established before 'postcopy' ones. And for new
migration to start, it is necessary that 'main' and 'multifd' channels
(when enabled) are established before migration starts.

* The first requirement for this race to occur is that two types of
channels are created together at the same time. Let's see:

   * Postcopy migration:  without multifd enabled
      - 'main' channel is created before the migration starts. And
'postcopy' channels are created towards the end of precopy migration,
when the Postcopy phase starts. So in this scenario the race does not
happen.

   * Postcopy resume: without multifd enabled
      - As described in the comment above, preempt channel is created
_after_ the 'main' channel to avoid the race condition.

   * Postcopy migration: with multifd enabled
      - 'main' and 'multifd' channels are created before migration
starts. And 'postcopy' channels are created towards the end of precopy
migration, when the Postcopy phase starts. No race occurs.

   * Postcopy resume: with multifd enabled
      - 'multifd' channels are shutdown before Postcopy starts, ie. no
'multifd' channels exist during Postcopy resume. So no race between
'postcopy' and 'multifd' channels.
      - And 'postcopy' channels are created after the 'main' channel
to avoid the race between them.
      - postcopy_do_resume() does not seem to create 'multifd' channels.

   * Multifd migration: without Postcopy enabled
      - 'main' and 'multifd' channels are created before the migration
starts. They both send 'magic value' bytes, so are easier to
differentiate. No race occurs.

* If we read it as a question:
    - migration_needs_multiple_sockets() ? True => Yes, migration
needs multiple sockets.
    - migration_needs_multiple_sockets() ? False => No, migration does
not need multiple sockets.

Then it should return 'True' when both migrate_multifd() and
postcopy_preempt() are enabled.

* Postcopy preempt could be a peekable channel ? Currently it does not
send magic value, does it?

there since the beginning, no?

* Sorry, I did not get that. Enabling them together means that they
are _not_ exclusive, no? It is not Either 'multifd'  OR 'postcopy'
case, anymore.

* The reason we need to touch the channel discovery part is: with
'multifd' and 'postcopy' both enabled, towards the end of migration,
when 'postcopy' connection comes in
     migration_ioc_process_incoming(...)
    {
        if (migrate_multifd() && !migrate_mapped_ram() &&
!migrate_postcopy_ram() &&
             qio_channel_has_feature(ioc, QIO_CHANNEL_FEATURE_READ_MSG_PEEK)) {
             ...
         } else {
             default_channel = !mis->from_src_file;
         }
        ...
        if (migrate_multifd()) {
            multifd_recv_new_channel(ioc, &local_err);
        } else {
           postcopy_preempt_new_channel(mis, f);
        }
    }

* The first 'if (migrate_multifd() ... !migrate_postcopy_ram()')
evaluates to false, in the else part 'default_channel' also evaluates
to false, because the 'main' channel is established. Now the new
incoming connection falls in the second migrate_multifd() block and
gets processed via - multifd_recv_new_channel(ioc, &local_err); call
and migration would not complete/finish.

* To identify the incoming postcopy connection, in the very first
version of this series, a magic value for the postcopy channel was
introduced and everything else remained the same.

* Would that be an acceptable solution for now?

* IMHO, we need not put this series on hold, for now we could go ahead
with the postcopy magic value patch if that works. And the larger
overhaul of the channel discovery part could be done as a separate
series of its own.

Thank you.
