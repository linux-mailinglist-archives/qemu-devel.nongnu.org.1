Hmm.  bdrv_co_is_all_zeroes() is supposed to be fast, but you're right
that even faster than a syscall or two is no syscalls at all.

That's a bigger refactoring; probably worth doing in a separate patch.
It looks like I should probably do a v4 along those lines, to see how
it compares.

That's pre-existing, but correct.  If we can't write zeroes with
unmap, then we mark the entire image dirty (every zero in the source
will result in zeroes in the dest - as it was before this series); and
we have also marked the zero bitmap (writing zeroes will be a no-op if
the zero bitmap says that is safe).  The rest of this function has two
purposes: finish pre-zeroing (well, there's nothing to pre-zero if we
can't punch holes, and especially nothing to pre-zero if we already
know the image reads as all zero), and populate the dirty bitmap (we
just populated the entire map here, so it's not worth trying to
populate the map with finer granularity later), so returning here is
the right thing to do.
