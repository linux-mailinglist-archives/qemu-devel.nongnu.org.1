Ok. I'd failed to register that the bare metal code was doing this though
with hindsight I guess that is obvious. Though without more info or
a bare metal example being given its also possible the BIOS was doing
enumeration etc (like CXL does for all < 2.0 devices) and hence was
building SRAT with the necessary memory ranges in place - even if the
driver then does the hot add dance later.

That's dubious and likely to break at some point unless the spec
comprehends this use case, but meh, so are lots of other things and
the hardware vendor gets to pick up the pieces and deal with grumpy
customers.

I don't currently see this as a safe solution for the proposed other
use cases however that are virtualization only.
