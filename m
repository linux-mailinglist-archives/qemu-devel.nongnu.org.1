Yes, I think so if I recall it correctly.

not necessarily, eventually we might want to plug sockets someday,
machine would expose only have_socket in hotpluggable CPUs interface
and hotplugging a CPU would look like (device_add xeon_E5_2630,socket-id=3D=
X),
which resembles real hw use-case. And that xeon device would create interna=
lly
all necessary vCPUs, and configure internal parameters topo/caches/whatnot.

that wasn't the case in the past for virt world, as main goal of it there
is dynamic scalability, while in real hw (in x86 world) it's mainly RAS
feature.

It looks to me as too complicated approach, I'll comment there.
