Today, there are many functions use Error, but there are also functions that still follow old error handling patterns. When legacy functions call functions with Error, a common pattern is to use error_report_err() and return -1.

Yes, that's what I meant.

The migration patch series I mentioned earlier can also use one.

It is insightful. The cover letter can have a reference to it and this 
patch can have similar description.

However I still have a few counterarguments:

A reason of the &error_warn usage may be caused by the complexity
to deal with unhandled errors and programming errors. If so, adding 
mechanisms to ease that may naturally sufficiently reduce the wrong 
usage added in the future.

The "&error_fatal without exit(1)" may be good enough for unhandled 
errors. For example, "[PATCH v10 00/27] migration: propagate vTPM errors 
using Error objects" would not have used &error_warn if there is the 
"&error_fatal without exit(1)".

There are also warn_report*() functions which also have the same 
problem. A comprehensive solution needs to deal with them all. Removing 
all of them will do but may not be practical. Another possibility is 
that to write a documentation telling warning should be avoided for 
unhandled/programming errors and let all refer to it.

I agree that there is little valid usage of &error_warn and removing it 
may not cause a problem at all, but it is still nice if there is a 
reasoning for the removal, ideally addressing these counterarguments as 
well.
