Challenging definitely, worthwhile unknown, but putting the issues in
writing can only help.

There's no hard dependency; migration's error reporting wrongs can
certainly be righted without converting to the job abstraction.
Studying how the job abstraction does errors may still help.

Ignore BlockJob here, focus on Job.

BlockJob came first, in 2012: commit eeec61f2913 (block: add BlockJob
interface for long-running operations).  It then grew quite a bit to
accomodate new job types and provide more control.

Job appeared in 2018 as "infrastructure for generic background jobs that
aren't tied to a block device" (commit 33e9e9bd62d (job: Create Job,
JobDriver and job_create()).  Substantial parts of the BlockJob
interface are actually deprecated in favor of the Job interface.  I
believe BlockJob still exists for things that are actually
block-specific, and possibly for things we neglected to move over.

So, CommonJob already exists: it's Job, defined in qapi/job.json.

To find out, we'd have to examine how the migration state machine and
interface could map to the Job state machine, and how the Job interface
could map to migration's internal interfaces.

The mapping may lose detail.  Generic Job is supposed to cover the
generic aspects.  Some specific jobs may need job-specific interfaces we
can't or prefer not to fit into Job.

The Job abstraction defines possible states and state transitions.  Each
job finds its own path from the initial state @created to the final
state @concluded.  If a state doesn't make sense for a certain type of
job, it simply doesn't go there.

So, job states migration doesn't want are only a problem if there is no
path from start to finish that doesn't go through unwanted states.

There may also be states migration wants that aren't job states.  We
could make them job states.  Or we map multiple migration states to a
single job state, i.e. have the job state *abstract* from migration
state details.

JobVerb is used internally to restrict certain job commands to certain
job states.  For instance, command job-dismiss is rejected unless job is
in state @concluded.

This governs the generic job-FOO commands.  It also covers the legacy
block-job-FOO commands, because these wrap around the same C core as the
job-FOO commands.

We could have commands specific to a certain job type (say migration
jobs) that bypass the JobVerb infrastructure, and do their own thing to
restrict themselves to certain states.  Probably stupid if the states
that matter are job states.  Probably necessary if they aren't (say a
more fine-grained migration state).

Is there really no way to track migration progress approximately?

Here's the relevant doc comment:

    # @current-progress: Progress made until now.  The unit is arbitrary
    #     and the value can only meaningfully be used for the ratio of
    #     @current-progress to @total-progress.  The value is
    #     monotonically increasing.
    #
    # @total-progress: Estimated @current-progress value at the completion
    #     of the job.  This value can arbitrarily change while the job is
    #     running, in both directions.

I think this should work fine for convergence-triggered finish.
@current-progress could be the number of "things" sent (for some
arbitrary, convenient choice of "things").  Monotonotically increasing.
@total-progress then would have to be a more or less rough estimate of
@current-progress plus what still needs to be sent.  For RAM,
@current-progress could be number of pages sent, ane @total-progress
could be number of pages sent + (possibly estimated) number of dirty
pages.  Multiply by page size if that makes adding the estimated size of
the non-RAM transfers easier.

I haven't thought about postcopy.

Fair points!

Which ones are due to the external Job interface, and which ones are
"only" due to its current implementation?

Thanks a lot for writing all this!
