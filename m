This is a tricky problem the way the tests are currently written, given the
desire for a minimal-change from the old avocado impl.

IIUC, avocado already had a per-test timeout, so would suffer the same
problem with downloads exploding the "normal" running time when cached.

To address this we'll need a refactoring to enable us to declare the
required "assets" externally from the test code.

Taking one simple example

  class LinuxInitrd(QemuSystemTest):

      def test_with_2gib_file_should_exit_error_msg_with_linux_v3_6(self):

          kernel_url = ('https://archives.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/fedora/li'
                        'nux/releases/18/Fedora/x86_64/os/images/pxeboot/vmlinuz')
          kernel_hash = '41464f68efe42b9991250bed86c7081d2ccdbb21'
          kernel_path = self.fetch_asset(kernel_url, asset_hash=kernel_hash)
          ...snip...

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      QemuSystemTest.main()


Consider if we declared all required assets as class level variable

  class LinuxInitrd(QemuSystemTest):

      ASSETS = {
         "fedora18": {
	    "url": ('https://archives.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/fedora/li'
                     'nux/releases/18/Fedora/x86_64/os/images/pxeboot/vmlinuz'),
            "hash": "'41464f68efe42b9991250bed86c7081d2ccdbb21'"
	 }
      }

Then, we change the 'fetch_asset' method to take an asset name, not a
URL+hash:

      def test_with_2gib_file_should_exit_error_msg_with_linux_v3_6(self):
          kernel_path = self.fetch_asset("fedora18")

Now, 'fetch_asset' would lookup the URL + hash in the self.__class__.ASSETS
dict, so the test would run exactly as before.

Finally, we modify QemuSystemTest.main() so that knows to look for a
'--fetch-assets' parameter in sys.argv. When it see --fetch-assets,
instead of running each test, it should download everything found in
the ASSETS class variables.

This now gives us the ability to  run a separate '--fetch-assets'
invokation with elevated timeout, while runing tests with a normal
timeout.

This is all a non-trivial amount of work though, so I don't think
it is reasonable todo this as part of the immediate conversion in
this series.

The only short term option is to configure meson run tests with a
massively larger timeout, until we're able to enable some pre-caching
mechansim.

With regards,
Daniel
