Though these conditions are not a matter of safety, but of correctness.

I don't think we expect to have preconditions here that are required for
safety (in the sense with which the term is used in Rust).

But safe code is not automatically correct.

If you added "unsafe" for every function that requires some
preconditions to be met so that it functions correctly (instead of only
so that it doesn't have undefined behaviour on the language level), then
you would annotate almost every function as "unsafe".

I think the rule of thumb for marking a function unsafe is when you have
unsafe code inside of it whose safety (not correctness!) depends on a
condition that the caller must reason about because you can't guarantee
it in the function itself.

This macro should probably only be used with code that can guarantee the
safety of its unsafe blocks in itself. The C side of constructors can't
make many guarantees anyway, and there is nobody who would reason about
them.
