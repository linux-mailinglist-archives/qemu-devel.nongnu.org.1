I'm looking at how to include this command in the new "single binary".

Markus explained in an earlier series, just expanding this command as
stub to targets that don't implement it is not backward compatible and
breaks QMP introspection. Currently on s390x we get a result, on other
targets the command doesn't exist. If we add a stubs, then other targets
return something (even if it is an empty list), confusing management
interface.

So this approach use to deprecate process to include a new command
which behaves differently on non-s390x targets.

If we don't care for this particular case, better. However I'd still
like to discuss this approach for other target-specific commands.

Years ago we said, "all HMP must be based on QMP". Now we realize HMP
became stable because QMP-exposed, although not consumed externally...

Does the concept of "internal QMP commands" makes sense for HMP debug
ones? (Looking at a way to not expose them). We could use the "x-"
prefix to not care about stable / backward compat, but what is the point
of exposing to QMP commands that will never be accessed there?

OK.

What I mentioned earlier could be 'Feature "internal" or "debug"'.

Could follow the rules and be renamed as "origin-coordinate-x".
