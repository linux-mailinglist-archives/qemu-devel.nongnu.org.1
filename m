Sorry, If I am adding noise on this topic. I made this suggestion
because I spotted some asymmetry in the proposal.

The send and recv implementation in VFIO relies on different
interfaces with different level of complexity. The send part is
using a set of multifd callbacks called from multifd threads,
if I am correct. Whereas the recv part is directly implemented
in VFIO with local thread(s?) doing their own state receive cookery.

I was expecting a common interface to minimize assumptions on both
ends. It doesn't have to be callback based. It could be a set of
services a subsystem could use to transfer state in parallel.
<side note>
      VFIO migration is driven by numerous callbacks and it is
      difficult to understand the context in which these are called.
      Adding more callbacks might not be the best approach.
</side note>

The other comment was on optimisation. If this is an optimisation
then I would expect, first, a non-optimized version not using threads
(on the recv side).

VFIO Migration is a "new" feature which needs some more run-in.
That said, it is stable, MLX5 VFs devices have good support, you
can rely on me to evaluate the future respins.

Thanks,

C.
