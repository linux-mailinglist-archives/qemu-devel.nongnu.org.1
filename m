Why can't we use -device?

Beware, designing a generic interface can be harder, sometimes much
harder, than designing a specialized one.

device_add and qom-set are generic, and they have issues:

* device_add effectively bypasses QAPI by using 'gen': false.

  This bypasses QAPI's enforcement of documentation.  Property
  documentation is separate and poor.

  It also defeats introspection with query-qmp-schema.  You need to
  resort to other means instead, say QOM introspection (which is a bag
  of design flaws on its own), then map from QOM to qdev.

* device_add lets you specify any qdev property, even properties that
  are intended only for use by C code.

  This results in accidental external interfaces.

  We tend to name properties like "x-prop" to discourage external use,
  but I wouldn't bet my own money on us getting that always right.
  Moreover, there's beauties like "x-origin".

* qom-set & friends effectively bypass QAPI by using type 'any'.

  Again, the bypass results in poor documentation and a defeat of
  query-qmp-schema.

* qom-set lets you mess with any QOM property with a setter callback.

  Again, accidental external interfaces: most of these properties are
  not meant for use with qom-set.  For some, qom-set works, for some it
  silently does nothing, and for some it crashes.  A lot more dangerous
  than device_add.

  The "x-" convention can't help here: some properties are intended for
  external use with object-add, but not with qom-set.

We should avoid such issues in new interfaces.

We'll examine how this applies to device_set when I review the QAPI
schema.

Clue: no update to the QAPI schema, i.e. the QMP command does not exist.

How exactly is the device selected?  You provide a clue above: 'can be
located by "id" or via driver+property match'.

I assume by "id" is just like device_del, i.e. by qdev ID or QOM path.

By "driver+property match" is not obvious.  Which of the arguments are
for matching, and which are for setting?

If "id" is specified, is there any matching?

The matching feature complicates this interface quite a bit.  I doubt
it's worth the complexity.  If you think it is, please split it off into
a separate patch.

Next question.  Is there a way for management applications to detect
whether a certain device supports device_set for a certain property?

Without that, what are management application supposed to do?  Hard-code
what works?  Run the command and see whether it fails?

I understand right now the command supports just "admin-state" for a
certain set of devices, so hard-coding would be possible.  But every new
(device, property) pair then requires management application updates,
and the hard-coded information becomes version specific.  This will
become unworkable real quick.  Not good enough for a command designed to
be generic.

Since qdev_get_device_class() sets an error when it fails, *errp is not
null here, ...

... which makes this wrong.  Caught by error_setv()'s assertion.

Please test your error paths.
