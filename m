We've got 2 flags proposed in patch 1 - "deprecated" and "not_secure" -
which we formally expose to mgmt apps/users. Both of these are actionable
in an unambiguous way. An application can query this info, and can also
tell QEMU to enforce policy on this. Both are good.

The "better alternatives" conceptable, however, is an inherantly fuzzy
concept, because "better" is very much a use-case depedent / eye of the
beholder concept. This would makes it difficult/impractical for an
application to take action based on such a "better-alternatives' schema
marker. It would imply the application has to understands the better
alternatives ahead of time, as well as understanding the end users'
intent and that's not really viable.



This is a long winded way of saying that while "better alternatives"
is certainly a concept that is relevant, I'm not convinced it belongs
in the schema, as opposed to being a documentation task.

We haven't consistently provided documentation in the manual for every
device, so in many cases '-device help' is all that exists, but in the
case of USB we do actually have docs:

  https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/devices/usb.html

and those docs give little guidance to users about 'usb-hub', so IMHO
that's where we should be documenting the tradeoffs of the different
USB config scenarios.

With regards,
Daniel
