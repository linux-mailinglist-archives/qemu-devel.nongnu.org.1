This commit message is very confusing. Commit 7ead9469 was primarily
about qcow2 data files, it certainly didn't forget them. It also didn't
do something in other places, but not in qcow2. Another thing it wasn't
about is command line arguments, but it restricted the references stored
in (potentially untrusted) image files.

The main difference between it and this patch is that commit 7ead9469
was about opening images (which is a security problem because you might
deal with untrusted images), and this one is about creating images
(which has no such problem, you're creating the image only now).

Of course, if you can't open an image with protocol: syntax, it makes
sense that creating it with the same syntax fails, too, for consistency.
So I'm not opposed to this patch, but I think it needs a completely
different commit message.

If we want to be consistent with opening, VMDK extents should pass
allow_protocol_prefix=false.
