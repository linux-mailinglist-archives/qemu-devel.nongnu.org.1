How valid is -nbd -qcow2 even? Wasn't there the fundamental problem that
NBD devices can't grow?

Running various image formats may be useful for other protocols, but I'm
not sure that NBD is one of them.

Well, bdrv if anything (block driver rather than BlockDriverState).

But we also have -fuse, which isn't really a block driver, but it just
means that we're using the file protocol on top of a FUSE export...

Probably not worth renaming from one imperfect name to another imperfect
one.
