running UEFI guest under TCG was always slow (more so for aarch64),
but we keep adding more sub-cases to bios-tables-test (each running
firmware), and that takes extra time.
Overall time to run bios-tables-test naturally increases,
so we have to increase timeout eventually regardless of everything else.
(however there has not been new tests added since 9.0)

In cases I've looked at, meson timed out at the end of bios-tables-test,
where almost all cases were executed modulo the last.
Given flakiness of failure and changes to sub-cases, a few things
could lead to it:
  * performance regression when executing aarch64 tests, not much but enough
    to push the last sub-test behind 10min boundary more often than not
    (either qemu or firmware) (maybe running a few 9.0 jobs and comparing
     them to the current master would show if guest became slower)
  * CI job runners became slower (we can't control that if I'm not wrong).
    As was suggested in another thread running less test in parallel
    might help. But I won't bet on it, since it the end (by the time close
    to timeout) only a few test are still running so it might be not much
    contention on CPU resources.
