Yes, I mean this case

And I don't follow why we should not care.

Usually we have no assumptions about data at offset, if write(offset, ..) failed. We just retry write.

Here we do this assumption "if there were zeroes, they will not be broken by writing zeroes even on failure scenarios", for any kind of block-driver and underlying file system.

You say "corrupts the disk". Of course, if disk is corrupted - everything is broken, and we should not care. The result of the mirror would be incorrect anyway. But we don't consider any EIO as disk corruption. We do retry the write and continue mirror operation.

Moreover, if EIO is returned due to some broken sector, we may hope that retrying the write will fix it, probably some other sector will be allocated by FS (I hope I'm not talking nonsense). But relying on the data still read as zero without rewriting would be wrong.
