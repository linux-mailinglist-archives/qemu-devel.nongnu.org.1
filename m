&gt; &gt; Can you explain 3 more?<br>
&gt; Pablo and I have looked into object files for one of default trace poi=
nt &quot;trace_vhost_commit&quot;(first tracepoint of hw/virtio) before and=
 after making this change and we found that by moves the hot-path check for=
 _simple_trace_vhost_commit into the caller (in the .h file) and leaves the=
 full stack-frame prologue and tracepoint body in the cold path. By inlinin=
g only the if (trace_events_enabled()) test at the call site, we eliminate =
the 11-instruction prologue overhead (stack allocation, canary load/store, =
register spills, and argument masking) on every vhost commit(trace call) wh=
en tracing is disabled.<br>
&gt; The old disassembled code looks like this:-<br>
&gt; 0x10stp x29, x30, [sp, #-64]!Prologue: allocates 64-byte frame and sav=

&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I am replying because I take the blame for this :) and as an =

&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; For now we mostly looked at differences between the code that=
 tracetool generates for the various backends, and the observation that som=
e of them put code in the .h and some in the .c file. I explained to Tanish=
 the concept of separating hot vs cold code in theory, showed him some exam=
ples in QEMU where performance measurements were done in the past, and sugg=
ested applying this to various backends (starting with the one with the wei=
rdest choice!). However we didn&#39;t do any measurement yet.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Some possibilities that come to mind:<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; 1) maybe the coroutine benchmarks are enough to show a differ=
ence, with some luck<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; 2) a new microbenchmark (or a set of microbenchmarks that try=
 various level of register pressure around the tracepoint), which would be =
nice to have anyway<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; 2 is going above and beyond :). I&#39;m not trying to make life ha=

&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Another option if 1 or 2 are difficult to quantify: I&#39;d be hap=

&gt;&gt; just a &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; disassembly snippe=
t from objdump showing<br>
&gt;&gt; that the instructions at a call site changed as intended.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; What I&#39;m looking for is a commit description that explains the=

&gt;&gt; it&#39;s easy for me to merge because it has a justification and t=
he<br>
&gt;&gt; nature of the commit will be clear to anyone looking at the git lo=
g in<br>
&gt;&gt; the future.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; 3) perhaps we could try to check the code size for some objec=
t files in block/ (for example libblock.a.p/*.c.o), as a proxy for how much=
 instruction cache space is saved when all tracepoints are disabled<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; We can start from 3, but also try 1+3 and 2+3 if it fails if =
you think that would be more persuasive.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Can you explain 3 more? Total code size on disk should stay about =
the<br>
&gt;&gt; same because most trace events only have one call site. Moving cod=
e<br>
&gt;&gt; between the caller and callee doesn&#39;t make a big difference in=
 either<br>
&gt;&gt; direction. At runtime there is a benefit from inlining the conditi=
on<br>
&gt;&gt; check since the call site no longer needs to execute the callee&#3=
9;s<br>
&gt;&gt; function prologue/epilogue when the trace event is runtime-disable=
d,<br>
&gt;&gt; but that CPU cycle and instruction cache effect won&#39;t be visib=
le from<br>
&gt;&gt; the on-disk code size.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Thanks,<br>
