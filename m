Sorry, yes, my bad.

Correct.

Sigh, yes, somehow I got the examples inverted slightly. It was
correct in my head at least :-)

I don't mind a short term NBD only solution for 10.2 is we think
we can rationalize that the specific NBD usage pattern is safe,
if it is easier to delay AioContext thoughts untill 11.0 dev cycle.
