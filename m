+1.

 I also prefer to leverage current exist "+/-pmu" option instead of adding
a new option. More options, more complexity. When they are not
inconsistent, which has higher priority? all these are issues.

Although KVM_CAP_PMU_CAPABILITY is a VM-level PMU capability, but all CPUs
in a same VM should always share same PMU configuration (Don't consider
hybrid platforms which have many issues need to be handled specifically).

It seems KVM_CAP_PMU_CAPABILITY is called to only disable PMU here. From
point view of logic completeness,  KVM_CAP_PMU_CAPABILITY should be called
to enabled PMU as well when user wants to enable PMU.

I know currently we only need to disable PMU, but we may need to enable PMU
via KVM_CAP_PMU_CAPABILITY soon.

We are working on the new KVM mediated vPMU framework, Sean suggest to
leverage KVM_CAP_PMU_CAPABILITY to enable mediated vPMU dynamically
(https://lore.kernel.org/all/Zz4uhmuPcZl9vJVr@google.com/). So It would be
better if the enable logic can be added here as well.

Thanks.
