Hi; thanks for this patch. I'm going to prefix my review by saying
that I'm not an expert on this floppy controller, so I am going
by what I can make out from the datasheet, which is not super
clear on this.

(minor style nit: multiline comments should start with the "/*" on
a line of its own. This file is very old code so it doesn't follow
our current style on this point.)

So this is the "we are multitrack, we are on head 1 and hit
the end of the disk" case. The datasheet
https://wiki.qemu.org/images/f/f0/29047403.pdf
describes the MT bit like this:

# MT: Multi-track selector
# When set, this flag selects the multi-track operating mode.
# In this mode, the 82078 treats a complete cylinder, under head 0
# and 1, as a single track. The 82078 operates as if this expanded
# track started at the first sector under head 0 and ended at the last
# sector under head 1. With this flag set, a multitrack read or write
# operation will automatically continue to the first sector under
# head 1 when the 82078 finishes operating on the last sector under
# head 0.

That all describes the behaviour for the "at end of head 0"
case (which is in the if() block before this), and looking at
the code we already do that correctly without claiming that
it is a seek.

What it doesn't say anything about is automatically rolling
from head 1 back to head 0 when we reach the end on head 1.
For that we need to look at the info about the read and write
commands:

Table 6-6 in the datasheet has the information about what the
track (C), head (H) and sector (R) should be after a transfer.
Summarizing that and numbering the cases:

(1) regardless of MT, if we didn't hit end-of-track we just
    increment the sector count

(2) For MT=0, if we did hit end-of-track, reset sector count to 1
    and increment track count; don't change the head

(3) For MT=1, at end-of-track on head 0, leave the track count alone,
    flip to head 1, reset sector count to 1

(4) For MT=1 at end-of-track on head 1, flip to head 0, increment the
    track count, and reset sector count to 1

The current code's handling of new_sect, new_track and
new_head seems to me to follow all of that. So maybe our
problem is only that we should not set the SEEK bit in
the status register...

Here we change the MT=0 "reached end of track"
behaviour from "go to next track, call it a seek" to
"stay at the end of the track".  I think that if my
reading of the datasheet above is correct, we do still
want to increment new_track, but we don't want to set
the SEEK bit in the status register.

Incidentally I find the 'ret = 0' vs 'ret = 1' handling
in this function confusing -- we return 0 for the "hit
end of track in MT=0" case, but in the MT=1 case we
return 0 only when we hit the end of the track and the disk
is not double-sided. This seems inconsistent and perhaps
wrong -- maybe the code should always do 'ret = 0;' without
the "((cur_drv->flags & FDISK_DBL_SIDES) == 0)" check ?

Why do we need to change the test case? The commit message doesn't say.

Could we add some test cases for the multi-track cases ?
