We should be thinking of targeted unit tests. The difference between
this and a full OS is we don't need to manage multiple shifting memory
maps over time. Setup a page (or two) with the permissions you expect
and check that works.

This would also be the place to verify edge cases that a more complex
driver might get to but is hard to trigger because there are too many
moving parts.

IOW the scope of the qtest tests should be focused on atomic individual
features and the functional tests cover making sure everything works
together as a whole.
