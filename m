You're welcome! I appreciate your time, guidance and feedback.

Yes.

I see. It's the ideal state of the CLI, and -machine and -smp haven't
arrived here yet.

Yes.

I got your point, and putting the array in -machine does align with the
design of the other machine options nowadays.

Thanks! From this point of view, then per cache of objects does not meet
my needs.

Indeed, that's my dilemma, lost in the world of CLIs.

Yes, you're right!

Maybe cache size, as Jonathan mentioned for Arm side.

Thanks again! Then I made it clear that it would be most appropriate to
place the cache array in -machine, i.e., it's extensible and consistent
with the design of the rest of the machine's properties, as well as
consistent with my long-term needs.

Later on, if -machine is able to support JSON, it will also benefit from
it. If I have time, I will also think about how -machine can support
JSON.

Zhao
