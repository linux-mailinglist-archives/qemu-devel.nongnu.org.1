Hi Juergen, David,

I don't think we should use the IOMMU accesses and I don't think we
should change the virtio backends.

My preference would be to either use the patch as is, or (better) to
reuse the original Xen hooks already in place (qemu_ram_ptr_length and
xen_invalidate_map_cache_entry, see
https://marc.info/?l=qemu-devel&m=169828434927778).

Juergen did a good job at adding new hooks in a clean way, but from my
point of view I would still prefer to only have the two existing hooks
instead of having 4 (2 old, 2 new).
