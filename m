Ah, so you're saying an failure within qemu_loadvm_state_main() but during
POSTCOPY_INCOMING_LISTENING..  I think you're right.  It's possible.

In that case, exit-on-postcopy-error still sounds an overkill to me.  I
vote that we go ahead reusing exit-on-error for postcopy too. IIUC that's
what this current patch does as-is.
