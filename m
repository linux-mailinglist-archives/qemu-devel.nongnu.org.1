So is this a research project?  Or do you have explicit goals, e.g. on
reducing migration time, or make migration easier to converge?

These information might be helpful for reviewers to understand the ultimate
goal of this series.

Yes this won't trivially work cleanly, as ram_save_target_page() requires
migration context.  It may also not be thread-safe too.  E.g. qemufile
isn't thread-safe.

"maybe" it'll be easier to do it the other way round: allowing migration to
fetch entry from a ring by calling a registered ring op.

Right, that was also what I found - the ring may not work as well when the
guest is very busy.  Here the question is migration is normally more
challenging when that is the case.. and when with a pretty idle guest it's
easier to migrate anyway even with bitmap-only.  I think I noticed that
pretty late.

Yes, is this series using this approach?

I think the ring effect may be minimum if there is the bitmap already,
because as long as the ring can fallback (to avoid hanging a vcpu for a
long time) it means the bitmap can contain useful data and the bitmap scans
will be needed, then it kind of invalidates the ring's benefit, IMHO.

What I was thinking a long time ago was something like this: we only use
ring, as you said in (2) above, so no bitmap.  Then the migration core can
look like this:

  migration_thread():
    count=0
    while () {
        count++
        if ((count % ENFORCE_BACKGROUND_COUNT == 0) ||
            ring_empty())
            send_page(background.pop())
        else
            send_page(ring.pop())
    }

To explain it a bit:

  - we will have two page iterators:

    - background.pop() means we pop one background page.  Here since we
    don't have a bitmap, we can't scan anything, the background page will
    be an iterator that will migrate the guest memory from page 0 to page
    N-1 (considering there's N guest pages), once and for all.  It means we
    pop guest page 0, then 1, ... until N-1, then it's all done.  After
    this iteration, nothing will be needed in background, all dirty will
    only reside in the ring.

    - ring.pop() means we fetch one entry from the ring.

  - here ENFORCE_BACKGROUND_COUNT will guarantee the background work can
    always make some progress over time, so that at some point it'll flush
    empty and only ring entries left.  Otherwise if we do things like "if
    (!ring_empty()) send_page(ring.pop())" it can happen that we keep
    sending ring pages but we never sent the initial round of RAMs, so it
    will never completes.

Then the background migration doesn't need to keep iterating but only
happen once, and then we know we've finished.

That will be a totally different way to describe migration.  I don't know
whether it'll make sense at all.  There're a lot of hard questions to
answer, e.g. besides MIGRATION we also have TCG/VGA bitmap consumers, and
we need to know how to handle them.  It's also just challenging to remove
all bitmap layers because there're just a huge lot of them in QEMU..

I'm not sure whether above would help at all, but let me still put this
here, maybe it'll let you think about something useful.

It's interesting to know there's already a perf difference.  I wonder how
that happened, though, if the bitmap is still there, and it looks like the
scan will still be needed anyway.

I didn't look where a ring full event in kvm can imply halting the vcpu
threads, if with that, and if the vcpu is dirtying something it can even
dirty it slower, it can contributes to a less total dirty pages to move.
Then maybe the total migration time is reduced because of that.  But I'm
not sure.

Not sure how you nail this, but IMHO this can be a very research-level
projects.  I'm not sure what's your goal, if it's about contributing to
qemu there can be more solid problems to solve.  Let me know if it is the
case. At least I am not crystal clear on how to best leverage the rings
yet, I guess, even though it feels like a pretty neat design.
