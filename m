IMHO this usage in migration is not really about error reporting
though, and the lifecycle ownership of the Error objects in this
migration usage is very diferent from the typical lifecycle
ownership of Error objects used in reporting errors, which I think
leads to a surprising / unusual API.

Yes, having a common API for these two similar use cases would be
a useful thing. I'm just not convinced we should be (mis|re)using
the Error object for either of these two situations.
