is "raw" information to the plugin, that may/may not use architecture spe=
cific knowledge to do its work. We already have plugins that have similar=
 per architecture knowledge (contrib/plugins/howvec.c) and it's ok in som=

>=20I was not thinking about a new interface for this. Having the "raw" i=
nterrupt id is enough for a plugin to do useful things, by having knowled=
ge of which architecture it's instrumenting.

But what is would the "raw" interrupt id even be for a given
architecture? I don't think you can answer this question with "obviously
this _one_ integer" for all of them.

>=20
>=20However, for control flow analysis, beyond a simple counting plugin, =
we probably want to access further data almost everytime.
>=20
>=20I see it closer from syscall instrumentation, which pushes the syscal=
l id, and all register values, instead of letting the user poke it. Makes=
 more sense compared to that?

Yes, but then you are in "GArray of named, potentially complex value"
terretory again. And the comparison with syscalls also falls apart when
you consider that, for syscalls, they are well defined and enumerated
identically for at least a variety of targets, while the same kind of
"enumeration", if it even exists, is in completely different order for
every architecture.

Even if we don't provide it for all events yet, it's ok.

>=20To the opposite of interrupt id, a PC is something universal by defin=
ition, and with a single meaning across architecture. However, accessing =
it by name varies per architecture, and even per sub events, as you are s=
tating for RISC-V.

Yes. And for that very reason I would not pass "the EPC" to a callback
but a clearly, target agnostic, defined value such as:

| The PC of the instruction that would have been executed next, were it
| not for that event

or

| The PC of the instruction that was executed befroe the event occurred

And unlike interrupt ids, the plugin API already has a precedent for
what type to use: uint64_t

Julian
