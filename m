Do you use the Tabor U-Boot or something else? How do you get to the comma=

't crash but then doesn't find bootable devices, not even with an emulated =
USB stick=2E Instead of dropping to the command prompt it only offers a res=

>which is reusing a sufficiently similar existing device just to have mini=
mal changes=2E This isn't the right way but since most of these just differ=
 in the reg offsets I wonder if we could turn these offsets into properties=
 so we don't need to add a new subclass for every device=2E I think subclas=
ses came from the pci version where the PCI IDs are different and maybe sys=
bus was modelled after that but we only need subclasses where additional re=
gisters are needed (which may be the case for this fsl device so this prope=
rty idea is just unrelated clean up)=2E

My implementation has similar usb_ops but is based on TYPE_CHIPIDEA which =
also has the "endpoints" registers covered=2E It is used by some i=2EMX mac=
hines and given that these and p1022 are NXP SoCs I wouldn't be surprised i=
f they shared a relation in the real world=2E

Bernhard
