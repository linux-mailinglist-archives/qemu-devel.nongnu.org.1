It was already big & complicated back when *I* started!

Yes, except even error_report() didn't exist, yet.  It made sense at the
time.

Yes.

The core of migration is a long-running background task.  We have
command line options and monitor commands to start and control it.

QMP commands need to pass their errors to the QMP core by setting @errp.
Any code they call should pass them the same way.  Conceptually easy,
although converting old code to pass error up instead of reporting them
can be tedious.

HMP commands should wrap around QMP commands an report to their monitor.
No issues there, as far as I know.

The hairy part is the background task.

I believe it used to simply do its job, reporting errors to stderr along
the way, until it either succeeded or failed.  The errors reported made
success / failure "obvious" for users.

This can report multiple errors, which can be confusing.

Worse, it was no good for management applications.  These need to
observe migration as a state machine, with final success and error
states, where the error state comes with an indication of what went
wrong.  So we made migration store the first of certain errors in the
migration state in addition to reporting to stderr.

"First", because we store only when the state doesn't already have an
error.  "Certain", because I doubt we do it for all errors we report.

Compare this to how jobs solve this problem.  These are a much, much
later invention, and designed for management applications from the
start[*].  A job is a state machine.  Management applications can
observe and control the state.  Errors are not supposed to be reported,
they should be fed to the state machine, which goes into an error state
then.  The job is not supposed to do actual work in an error state.
Therefore, no further errors should be possible.  When something goes
wrong, we get a single error, stored in the job state, where the
management application can find it.

Migration is also a state machine, and we long ago retrofitted the means
for management applications to observe and control the state.  What we
haven't done is the disciplined feeding of errors to the state machine.
We can still get multiple errors.  We store the first of certain errors
where the managament application can find it, but whether that error
suffices to explain what went wrong is a crap shot.  As long as that's
the case, we need to spew the other errors to stderr, where a human can
find it.

I figure that's how far we were able to drag migration forward.  More
dragging is called for, but it's hard work, and there's so much else to
do.

I don't believe in complicating control flow to make future cleanup
easier to add.  If we ever we add it, we need to review the entire
function to make sure it's called when needed no matter what.

Me too.  When all we need the return value to express is success
vs. failure, bool has served us much better than int.

I know...

Can we afford modest efforts to reduce the mess one step at a time?

You're welcome!


[*] If the job abstraction had been available in time, migration would
totally be a job.  There's no *design* reason for it being not a job.
Plenty of implementation and backward compatibility reasons, though.
