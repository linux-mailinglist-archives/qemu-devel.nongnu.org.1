Yes, exactly. The polling/wait phase of aio_poll() is sensitive since it
measures time, holds ctx->list_lock, and has ctx->notify_me enabled. In
that state we cannot call arbitrary code.

You're right, cqe_handler_bh is ugly. Either every dispatched callback
in the event loop should be its own BH (and BHs are the one and only
list of callbacks) or I can add the .dispatch() callback you suggested.
I need to play with the code a bit to compare the approaches. I'll
choose an approach for the next revision of this series.
