(b) makes sense.  I suppose that further justified what this document
wanted to make clear of, on that we should probably allow vmsd versioning
to be used, which is already better than either migration incompatible, or
even not support migration at all on the system.

But shouldn't we still have that tier to request "backward migration"?  Yes
it's not covered yet by any test, but maybe some day we can have it.
Besides, we're more discussing the goal which can apply to suggestions to
patch submitters and reviewers.  I think that's still a fair goal so that
on extremely popular devices + architectures, we still ask for bi-direction
migration capability.

Do we have a place where such tiering is documented?  Should I add one more
patch to describe it?

I think the hard thing is still how to justify which change will require
which tier: we were discussing machine type numbers, but normally IIUC many
devices can be used in multiple machine types, in that case should we pick
the strictest rule out of those machine types that such device support?
Maybe it'll be easier we just justify that during reviews.
