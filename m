QMP has the ability to tag commands/fields, etc as experimental.

libvirt will explicitly avoid consuming or exposing anything with
an experimental tag on it.

That is not required - individual struct fields can be marked
experimental.

The key question is what the intended usage of the fields/stats/etc
is to be. If you want it used by libvirt and mgmt apps it would need
to be formally supported. If it is just for adhoc QEMU developer
debugging and doesn't need libvirt / app support, then experimental
is fine.

Daniel
