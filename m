I'm actually less sure if the first half makes sense than the second half.

Exporting Property from QDEV did make me think it may be polluting the 
codebase with QDEV-specifics, but its motivation (creating properties 
without defining accessors) is clear and it meets its requirement.

The motivation is less concrete for the first half. It says the current 
code is explicit, but it is a relative term. I'm not sure if specifying 
TYPE_OBJECT_COMPAT is less explicit (or more implicit) than calling 
object_apply_compat_props(). Also, having a class for compat props but 
not for global props makes the decision look arbitrary. It is nice to 
have some clarification on these.
