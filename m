Partially relevant context is that on x86 we have the "isa-debugcon"
device, that effectively just creates a output only serial port
for firmware to use for debugging. That's an actual device though.

The problem with CPUs is that we don't have a -device <cpu-type>
for each CPU that's created, instead -cpu creates the devices
implicitly.

This might suggest using an object type instead, eg

  -object arm-ddc,cpu=0,chardev=cdev0
  -chardev pty,id=cdev0
  -object arm-ddc,cpu=1,chardev=cdev1
  -chardev pty,id=cdev2
  -object arm-ddc,cpu=2,chardev=cdev2
  -chardev pty,id=cdev2
  -object arm-ddc,cpu=3,chardev=cdev3
  -chardev pty,id=cdev3

And the CPU impl would just have to access some internal global API
from the 'arm-ddc' object type, to find its chardev, if any.

With regards,
Daniel
