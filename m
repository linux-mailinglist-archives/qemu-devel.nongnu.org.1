I knew it was possible, I was not so sure it'd be as stable as it has been.

Just an example for a distro we've already bent the rules for. Their base
Python is still technically 3.6 and they don't technically package Sphinx
for the newer interpreter, so it's a useful example case even if it is
arguably beyond our support window now.

I meant to suggest it's *my* problem, but I think distributions are aware
that not providing an (optional) non-EOL Python is not a viable option
these days.

Basically affirming: you will be able to build QEMU on a supported platform
with just your distro's repositories, and that's a promise.

I mean to say that I don't consider loading a newer Python provided by your
distribution as a violation of our platform promise: in many ways it is
"just another dep".

I wouldn't raise the minimum Python version unless affected distributions
had an alternate interpreter in their repository. OpenSUSE and CentOS both
offer this, so the option is viable.

However, this solution does not account for other Python dependencies like
Sphinx, which are very likely *not* repackaged by the distro for the newer
interpreter.

A normal end user can run configure and get the new deps automatically and
invisibly, no problem. Offline/isolated builds are slightly trickier.

So I mean to clarify: QEMU will always be able to be built with your distro
packages (sometimes with newer, alternative Python versions) but in this
specific case, some "optional" features where Python is concerned may
require side-loading Python dependencies from outside of your system
repository.

I.e. there may be degradation, but only for unit tests and docs, and only
when your base platform Python is EOL (five years old. It can be fixed by
using PyPI, allowing internet during configure, disabling tests and docs,
or doing the labor of adding a new package to your builddep environment.

So I pledge the core build will only need the newer Python from your system
repo, but tests and docs I only pledge support for if your Python is not
EOL (approx 5 years old or less.)

That's my proposal.

(Unless... haha. The idea is so stupid I don't even want to write it on
list. Ping me on matrix/IRC...)

I love Meson. Pure Python, zero deps. Trivial to vendor. It's a delight and
I'm glad they have such reasonable policies. It's a rare treat that never
causes problems for me <3

>I&#39;d like to re-iterate that my motivation here is not to stop<br>
supporting EOL python versions &quot;just because they are EOL&quot;, but r=
ather<br>
instead because the tooling and libraries surrounding Python<br>
aggressively drop support for those versions once they become EOL.<br>
That is, 3.9 is not difficult to support until e.g. Python 3.14 comes<br>
out and setuptools, pip, and sphinx begin targeting 3.14 at the<br>
expense of 3.9 and there is an increased burden of hacks and<br>
workarounds required to target 3.9-3.14 inclusive.<br></blockquote></div></=
