Certainly some methods are too big & deserve refactoring, but that's a
non-trivial investment, and it isn't always a clearcut win to split
code out into a bunch of arbitrarily short methods. You may solve the
goto/initialization problem, but make other things harder as you often
still have to fully page all the code into mind to understand it.

Human enforced standards are absolutely better than a free-for-all. Over
time contributors will gain familiarity with the project standards and
largely comply without enforcement being required. If contributors
repeatedly ignore coding standards, it will disincentivise reviewers
from looking at their patches.

I would really love if it we could apply clang-format to everything, but
that has a non-trivial impact on maint when done on a large pre-existing
codebase like QEMU. Cherry-picking to upstream stable or distros would
be immensely painful, verging on impossible, after a bulk reformat. For
any new codebase I'd go for clang-format every time.
