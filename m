I haven't. But when it fails we'll go through an entire release cycle
with this thing showing red for every person that runs the CI. Remember,
this is a CI failure to which there's no fix aside from waiting for the
release to happen. Even if we're quick to react and disable the job, I
feel it might create some confusion already.

Sorry, I'm not trying to force this in any way, I just wrote these to
use in the pull-request and thought I'd put it out there. At the very
least we can have your concerns documented. =)

(1)
Well, we haven't seen any false negatives, we've seen fields being
renamed. If that happens, then we'll ask the person to update the
script. Is that not acceptable to you? Or are you thinking about other
sorts of issues?

Having hidden procedures that maintainers run before a release is bad
IMHO, it just delays the catching of bugs and frustrates
contributors. Imagine working on a series, everything goes well with
reviews, CI passes, patch gets queued and merged and a month later you
get a ping about something you should have done to avoid breaking
migration. Right during freeze.

That's a good point. I don't think it applies here though. See my point
in (1).
