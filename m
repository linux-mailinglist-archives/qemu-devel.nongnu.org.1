IMHO the problem described above is a result of the design mistake of
having 2 separate QEMUFile instances for what is ultimately the same
channel. This was a convenient approach to take originally, but it has
likely outlived its purpose.

In the ideal world IMHO, QEMUFile would not exist at all, and we would
have a QIOChannelCached that adds the read/write buffering above the
base QIOChannel.

That's doable, but bigger than a quick fix. A natural stepping stone
to get there though is to move from 2 QEMUFile objs down to 1 QEMUFile,
which might be more practical as a quick fix.

With regards,
Daniel
