Just now noticing that this hasn't been reviewed yet...

In general, it's okay to ping the list after a week or so if you feel
like your patch has been overlooked.

getenv()'s result is non-reliable IF the application is calling
setenv()/putenv() to be changing the environment.  But if you treat
the environment as a read-only block of memory, then the getenv()
result has a lifetime equivalent to the entire process.  And a quick
grep:

$ git grep '\b[sp][eu]tenv('
tests/tcg/multiarch/linux/linux-sigrtminmax.c:        setenv("QEMU_RTSIG_MAP", rt_sigmap, 0);
util/envlist.c: * than putenv(3).

shows that we aren't generally modifying qemu's environ.  Okay, there
ARE a few calls to unsetenv() in util/systemd.c, but that's the file
you're modifying, and before this patch it was already using getenv()
without worrying about copying its results.  We _do_ need to modify
the environment after reading it, at which point, you might be right
that calling getenv(), then unsetenv(), then relying on the former
pointer may be unsafe; but if this is the only file manipulating the
environment we have quite a bit of control over safety aspects, and
may still be able to design something that doesn't have to copy
getenv() results.

A single g_strdup at process startup is not a memory leak, even if it
doesn't get explicitly freed, if you can't trigger it more than once.
An inability to g_free the copy is not fatal, as long as you are not
repeatedly duplicating the string each time a different caller wants
to also check what you already learned from getenv() on the first
caller.

Does systemd guarantee this particular size?  Should it be a #define?

I can put a value in the environment for LISTEN_FDS that will trip
this assertion, on a 64-bit platform.  While an early exit due to
garbage in the environment is okay, it should probably be cleaner than
by an assertion failure.

error_report() should not use trailing '.'.  A g_strdup'd buffer won't
suffer from this arbitrary length limitation.
