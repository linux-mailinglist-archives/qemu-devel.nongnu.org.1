I respectfully disagree and recommend taking another look at the code.

The device actually performs all logic in non-unsafe methods and is 
typed instead of operating on raw integers as fields/state. The C stuff 
is the FFI boundary calls which you cannot avoid; they are the same 
things you'd wrap under these bindings we're talking about.

QEMU calls the device's FFI callbacks with its pointer and arguments, 
the pointer gets dereferenced to the actual Rust type which qemu 
guarantees is valid, then the Rust struct's methods are called to handle 
each functionality. There is nothing actually unsafe here, assuming 
QEMU's invariants and code are correct.
