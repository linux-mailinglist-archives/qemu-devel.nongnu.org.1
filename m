Hmm.

1. Yes, we need to distinguish, is that _real_ migration or local. And setting a
special property for each device (which supports fd-migration) to turn on passing
FD to the channel seems not comfortable and error prune.

2. Initially, I decided separate "local-tap" and "local-vhost-user-blk" capabilities
just to simplify further testing/debugging in real environment: the possibility to
enable only "half of magic" helps.

So, granularity makes sence, but having local-XXX capability for each device class
looks bad.

Maybe, having generic cap-fd-passing, together with possibility to disable it on
per-device basis (like migrate-fd=false) is good compromise.


Another question is, do we need "local-incoming" option for target device.

Initially I added this because I thought: ho, I need to distinguish it initialization
time: do I need to call open(), or wait for incoming fd.

Now I see that I can just postpone this decision up to "start" point, where

- either I already have fd from incoming migration
- or have nothing: in this case, let's call open()

-

I'll try to go with one "fd-passing" capability, as any kind of granularity may be
added later on demand.


Hmm2. Probably we can avoid even adding such a capability, but just check, is migration
channel support fd passing or not? Seems too implicit for me.
