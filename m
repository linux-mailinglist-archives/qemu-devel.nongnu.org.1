Of course they want that guarantee. *insert usual unicorn example*

We can usually try hard, but "guarantee" is really a strong requirement 
that I am afraid we won't be able to give in many scenarios.

I'm sure CXL people were aware this is one of the basic issues of memory 
hotunplug (at least I kept telling them). If not, they didn't do their 
research properly or tried to ignore it.

Yes. And crashing is worth than anything else. Rather shutdown/reboot 
the offending machine in a somewhat nice way instead of crashing it.

Maybe there could be limitations (maximum addressable PFN?) where we 
would have to reject it? Not sure.

Yes.

Do we have any timeline when we will see real shared-memory devices? zVM 
supported shared segments between VMs for a couple of decades.

Maybe it could likely be extended, or one could built something similar 
that is better tailored to the "shared memory" use case.

For "ordinary" hotplug virtio-mem provides real benefits over DIMMs. One 
thing to consider might be micro-vms where we want to emulate as little 
devices+infrastructure as possible.

So maybe looking into something paravirtualized that is more lightweight 
might make sense. Maybe not.

kdump?
