Understand.

A bit more rationale in the commit message would be nice.  Perhaps start
with current state ("we deintent"), then describe the patch ("move the
deindent"), then rationale "to get it out of the way of a new thingy I
wrote, and intend to post soonish", then "which will replace qapidoc.py
entirely".
