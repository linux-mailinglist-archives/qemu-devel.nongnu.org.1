* I tried to reproduce the hang issue with and without -traces across
3 different machines but am unable to reproduce it on my side.

* Going through the source and the back trace you provided, you said
gdb hangs in the postcopy_ram_fault_thread() function at poll()
function to wait for a missing page.
   - But by this time, postcopy_ram_listen thread is already preparing
to cleanup and exit
       - That means postcopy migration is finished/ending
   - ie. postcopy migration is ending without (or before) migrating
all the RAM pages from the source side?

In postcopy mode:
    * Is there a way to log the pages (#numers) that are sent from the
source side?
    * And log the pages (#numbers) that are received on the receive side?

* That way we might be able to check/confirm the pages which were not
received or not processed properly.

* Can we connect the faulting/missing (HVA=0x7fffd68cc000)
address/page in postcopy_ram_fault_thread() with the memcpy that the
main thread seems to be loading via vapic_post_load()? ie. the main
thread and pocyopy_ram_fault_thread() above could be doing unrelated
things.

* Other than this, I've revised the patch-set as suggested. How do we
proceed further?

Thank you.
