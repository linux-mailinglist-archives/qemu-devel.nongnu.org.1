I was wondering how to reproduce the bugs that patches 2 and 3 fix. So I
tried to run your iotests case, and while it does catch the bug that
patch 1 fixes, it passes even without the other two fixes.

Is this expected? If so, can we add more tests that trigger the problems
the other two patches address?
