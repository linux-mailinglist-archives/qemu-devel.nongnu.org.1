Yes, for mirror, it cannot happen. There is a blocker that prevents
block_resize: "block device is in use by block job: mirror".

I can see block_job_add_bdrv() uses bdrv_op_block_all(), so resize for
the nodes used directly by the job cannot happen via QMP block_resize
while a job is running.

However, if we go with checking for BDRV_CHILD_FILTERED like you brought
up, there also is the possibility that a 'raw' node gets resized,
because its filtered 'file' node is resized (via QMP block_resize).

But it seems like resizing the 'file' node already is prohibited too
(tested mirror, backup, commit and stream):  "Permission conflict on
node 'file0': permissions 'resize' are both required by an unnamed block
device (uses node 'file0' as 'root' child) and unshared by node 'node0'
(uses node 'file0' as 'file' child)."

The only other case where .bdrv_co_getlength() is not implemented, but
.is_filter = true, is copy-before-write. There, the patch does not
change the behavior.

I'll this to the commit message in v2.

I agree that updating the size in the 'raw' parent node seems good. I'll
go with this in v2 and add a test for it too :)
