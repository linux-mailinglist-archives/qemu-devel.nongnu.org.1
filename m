Right, trivial as-is.  To me it's not a major blocker yet so far, but it's
still about being hackish, and I have this unpleasant feeling that we're
digging holes for our future.

Thanks. Are these maximum huge page the memsize can take (either 2M or 1G),
or is this only about 2M?

I can't say nobody uses small pages when memory is large.  The thing is
hugetlb loses features comparing to small pages; or say, merely all the
memory features Linux provides.  So I won't be surprised if someone tells
me there's TB level VMs that is using small page on purpose for any of
those features (swap, ksm, etc.).  I had vague memory there was customers
using such setup in the past, without remembering the reasons.

I do wish a design that will perform well even there, so it works for all
cases we can think of so far.  Not to mention cpr-transfer seems to
outperforms everywhere too.  Unless the "management layer benefits" are so
strong.. it seems to me we have a clear choice.  I understand it may affect
your plan, but let's be fair, or.. is it not the case?

I see.  Is OCI open source somewhere?

If it's close-sourced, maybe it'll be helpful to see how the exec() design
could benefit other open source mgmt applications.

It's out of my capability to review the mgmt impact on this one.  This is
all based on the idea that I think most mgmt apps supports reconnections
pretty well. If that's the case, I'd definitely go for the transfer mode.
I'm not sure whether there's anyone from mgmt layer would like to share
some opinion; Dan could be the most suitable in the loop already.

Thanks,
