This is not correct; "const fn"s *can* be evaluated at compile time.
In this case they won't since "self" is only available at run time.
The match statements persist in the final compiled code.

Your usage of macros also is a "when you have a hammer everything
looks like a nail" situation. You're going straight from code that
might be a bit C-like to code that looks like Perl. Rust macros can be
useful to reduce boilerplate, but in this case the macro-based
solution does not make it much easier to see all values at once for
verification purposes, and makes it harder to understand the code's
behavior.

What makes code more "Rusty" would be things like using Result for
error handling, taking advantage of the type system, using traits for
polymorphism, using references to guarantee memory safety. QEMU is
hardly doing any of this, and the rustdoc for qemu_api is also just
starting, so maybe this patch is getting a bit ahead of ourselves?

It's not reasonable to use 50 lines of code just for eight
identification bytes. Even the spec says "The registers can
conceptually be treated as a 32-bit register", which to me suggests
making its contents a u32 const and calling it a day. But if you want
to make it overengineered but sensible, then do this:

const fn getPartNumber(self) -> u12 {0x11}
const fn getDesignerID(self) -> u8 {match ...}
const fn getRevision(self) -> u4 {0x1}
const fn getConfiguration(self) -> u8 {match ...}

and then a getPeriphId(idx: u8) that puts the four together in a u32
and returns ((val32 >> (8 * idx)) & 255) as u8.

For PCellID, the spec itself says the value is 0xB105F00D, so *please*
just hardcode them in the read method. Anything else is a waste of
everybody's time. And since we're in hard freeze, maybe we should
reconsider the one line fix and leave everything for later.

Cool, thanks.
