For instance, GNU Bison is GPLv3+, but the parts the generator emits
(the parser skeleton) come with a special exception.

Such exceptions need to be granted by the copyright holder.  As long as
the code generating Go is not a derived work, the copyright holder
situation should be simple enough to make this practical.

Having this argument confirmed by an actual expert seems advisable.

What code do you have in mind?  Can you provide an example?
