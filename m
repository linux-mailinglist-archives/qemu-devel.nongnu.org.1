It won't work because the ARI next function number field is fixed. In 
this case, the field of the Function at 0x1.0x0 should point to 0x1.0x1, 
but it doesn't. As the result, the Function at 0x1.0x1 won't be recognized.

It's more problematic if some of the Functions are ARI-capable but 
others are not. In my understanding, all Functions in a ARI-capable 
device need to have ARI capability, but that's not enforced.
