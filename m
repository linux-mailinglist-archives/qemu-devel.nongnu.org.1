I'm not sure we talk about the same thing.

Converting all chardevs to new API .init + .connect is feasible, and I say
in cover letter:

But converting all chardev users to DEFINE_PROP_CHR_NO_CONNECT is another
thing:

git grep DEFINE_PROP_CHR | wc -l
71

- it would be a huge work, and no benefits. Having a default of "already
connected chardev" seems reasonable. No reason to teach these 70 frontends
to call _connect() by hand.

-

frontend/backend is always misleading terminology for me, especially when
we have more than two components in the system :/
