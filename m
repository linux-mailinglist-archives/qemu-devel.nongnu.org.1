Thanks for the suggestion. I recall now that I've hastily looked at pygdbmi
when writing the mte.py test.

I don't think it misses any functionality for our current purposes here, but
it has its own runner so we'll be using two different GDB runners for the
tests. I´d like to avoid it and stick with the simplest runner which doesn't
add another module dependency. The same for the test interface.

In general, pygdbmi seems more than it would be necessary for the GDB tests
we have currently. I would like to keep the tests as easy as possible to
be executed manually and I think that adding another API rather than GDB's
own Python API, currently, will not help.


Cheers,
Gustavo
