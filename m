It is an old revision (2.5). More recent revision (3.4) can be found at:

Both revisions 2.5 and 3.4 have the following statements, different from

Please ensure that you refer a correct datasheet and share it for me.

Revision 3.4's 4.6.1 Interrupts During Initialization says:

Drivers can ensure that old interrupts will not fire by following this 
procedure. The behavior when not following this is undefined (in the 
datasheet I'm referring to).
