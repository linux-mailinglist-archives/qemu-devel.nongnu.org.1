That's true. The priv spec check is also there because we needed newer
versions of the priv spec for some extensions, and if we are going to
check some it's simpler to just check all of them.

Agreed

I'm not sure about that though. As we see more CPUs being released and
then future spec changes I feel like differentiating between priv
specs is a useful feature.
