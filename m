We seem to have a few tests that use it, and then the fuse protocol
implementation, too. 308 and file-io-error look relevant.

Creating loop devices requires root privileges. If I understand
correctly, userstorage solved that by having a setup phase as root
before running the tests as a normal user? We don't really have that in
qemu-iotests.

Some tests require passwordless sudo and are skipped otherwise, but this
means that in practice they are almost always skipped.

Well, your patches make it do what we always claimed it would do, so
that consistency is certainly a good thing. Unmapping on write_zeroes
and ignoring truncate is a weird combination anyway that doesn't really
make any sense to me, so I don't think it's worth preserving. The other
way around could have been more defensible, but that's not how our bug
works.

Now, if ignoring all discard requests is a good default these days is a
separate question and I'm not sure really. Maybe discard=unmap should
be the default (and apply to both discard are write_zeroes, of course).
