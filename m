When would this target-specific hw call cpu_interrupt()
on a CPU which is not of that target architecture?
For instance, in the typhoon code you change in patch 2,
the CPUState argument to cpu_interrupt() and cpu_reset_interrupt()
is always that of one of the 4 CPUs pointed to by the
TyphoonState struct, which are guaranteed to be Alpha CPUs.
In some hypothetical world where this machine type had an
Arm board-management CPU on it as well, that CPU would not
be one of the ones pointed to by the TyphoonState struct,
which would still all be Alpha.

I can see that you would run into slight awkwardness on
a device that wanted to do this same kind of thing on two
CPU types at once, just because the defines are in cpu.h
and you can't #include them both at once. But are we going to
in practice have those on a heterogenous machine?

I do generally think that it's probably nicer design to
have cpu_interrupt() be internal to target/foo (it's how
arm does it, except for a handful of calls in obsolete SoC
models). But I think it might be helpful if you could give
a description of what the immediate issue is that means that
we need to do this cleanup to progress with the heterogenous
machine work (and to what extent we can leave existing code
in old non-heterogenous board and device models alone).
