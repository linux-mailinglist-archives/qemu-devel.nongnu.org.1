I think we shouldn't, as enum types in QAPI are CamelCase and members are lowercase. Still, it's probably a bad way to rely on text case (I just imagine documenting this:)) It could be "'discriminator-type': 'JobType'" instead.

Yes I thought about it, we'll call find_block_job_locked() twice. That's probably solvable by including some opaque pointer to QAPI structure, which could be set during json parsing and then reused by qmp_* command itself.. But I don't think it worth doing for simple search for a job. Simpler approach would be to cache globally last result of find_block_job().. But again that would be extra optimization
