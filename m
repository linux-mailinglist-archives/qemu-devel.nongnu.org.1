 I think that's fair.

I sent in the patch more out of a desire for qemu to have the greatest
possible ohci implementation, than due to knowledge of an actual OS that
couldn't work.

Up to you what to do from here.

<br>
&gt; Thanks, in responding to that, I&#39;m breaking down my responses into=
 the following answers:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Q1: (summarizing) What prompted us to make this change?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; A1: I&#39;m summarizing what I wrote in previous emails and the commit=
 message -<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; * Bring qemu closer to actual hw with a neatly packaged test case to d=
emonstrate the behavior<br>
&gt; * I interpret the spec (Table 4-2) as saying the &quot;be =3D cbp - 1&=
quot; is valid, in addition to setting &quot;cbp =3D 0&quot;<br>
&gt; * I interpret it that way due to a comment in an old linux kernel vers=
ion in the 2.x range, ohci-hcd.c file. It said (paraphrasing) some misbehav=
ing ohci controllers would fetch physical memory at 0 when cbp =3D 0 was in=
 the Transfer Descriptor<br>
<br>
Interesting. Do you have a more specific version for that?<br>
I had a look at various 2.x Linux OHCI drivers but they all seem to do<br>
zero-length packets &quot;by the spec&quot; with CBP=3DBE=3D0. eg <a href=
=3D"http://2.6.39.4" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">2.6.39.4</a>:<br>
<a href=3D"https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v2.6.39.4/source/drivers/usb/ho=
st/ohci-q.c#L539" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://elixir.bootl=
in.com/linux/v2.6.39.4/source/drivers/usb/host/ohci-q.c#L539</a><br>
and there&#39;s no hardware-quirk handling to do it differently on<br>
some controllers. (The USB OHCI driver seems to have gone through<br>
a couple of rewrites in the 2.x kernel timeframe; the earlier 2.3.51<br>
version does the TD fill here:<br>
<a href=3D"https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/2.3.51/source/drivers/usb/usb-o=
hci.c#L812" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://elixir.bootlin.com=
/linux/2.3.51/source/drivers/usb/usb-ohci.c#L812</a><br>
and again it handles zero length as BE=3DCBP=3D0.)<br>
<br>
&gt; But I only have a test case I created myself, and am not an expert on =
computer history here. I think &quot;be liberal in what you accept, by cons=
ervative in what you send&quot; applies when I don&#39;t know which histori=
cal OSes, if any, need this behavior. I think the behavior of actual hardwa=
re weighs more heavily since that *is* available and testable. Are there ad=
ditional checks that would expand on what&#39;s known about actual ohci hw?=
<br>
<br>
The other side of the argument is &quot;if in doubt and you don&#39;t<br>
know of any concrete problem being caused, don&#39;t change<br>
working code&quot;. If there are any historical OSes that rely on<br>
being able to send zero packets with be=3Dcbp-1 for some nonzero<br>
be, and anybody wants to run them on QEMU, then presumably they<br>
can send us a bug report saying &quot;XYZ&#39;s USB support doesn&#39;t wor=
k&quot;.<br>
That nobody has ever does this is evidence on the side of<br>
&quot;there is no such OS out there, everybody writing an OHCI driver<br>
read the spec and made their driver send zero length packets the<br>
way the spec very clearly says you should&quot;. Please correct me<br>
if I&#39;m wrong, but my interpretation of your helpful explanation<br>
