Sorry to be confusing, please feel free to ignore my previous comment.
That came from a very limited mindset that maybe one confidential VM should
only have one gmemfd..

Now I see it looks like it's by design open to multiple gmemfds for each
VM, then it's definitely ok that bios has its own.

Do you know why the bios needs to be convertable?  I wonder whether the VM
can copy it over to a private region and do whatever it wants, e.g.  attest
the bios being valid.  However this is also more of a pure question.. and
it can be offtopic to this series, so feel free to ignore.

Thanks,
