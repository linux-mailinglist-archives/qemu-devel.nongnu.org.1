Hmm - 64k is still small for some tasks; with qcow2, you can have
clusters up to 2M, and writing a cluster at a time seems to be a
reasonable desire.  Or in other storage areas, nbdcopy (from libnbd)
defaults to 256k and allows up to 32M, or we can even look at lvm that
defaults to extent size of 4M (although with lvm thin volumes,
behavior is more like qcow2 with subclusters in that you don't have to
allocate the entire extent at once).

Maybe it makes sense to have this as a hierarchichal spillover (first
level spills over to 64k, second level spills over to 2M or whatever
ACTUAL maximum you are willing to support)?

Or you can feel free to ignore my comments on this patch - allowing
64k instead of 4k is ALREADY a nice change.

What are typical block device minimum alignments?  If 4k is typical,
then it should be easy to make FUSE_IN_PLACE_WRITE_BYTES be 4k.  If
64k is typical, we're already doomed at being aligned.  Is being
unaligned going to cause the block layer to add bounce buffers on us,
if the block layer has a larger alignment than what we use here?

Makes sense, although it leads to some interesting bookkeeping.  (I'm
wondering if nbd would benefit from this split-level buffering, since
it supports reads and writes up to 32M)
