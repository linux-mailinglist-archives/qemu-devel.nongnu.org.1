Sure, but I'm talking about how do we instruct device developers on
fixing migration bugs. We cannot simply yell "regression!" and expect
people to care.

Once something breaks there's no easy way to determine what's the right
fix. It will always involve copying the migration maintainers and some
back and forth with the device people before we reach an agreement on
what's even broken.

When I say "clear recipes" what I mean is we'd have a "catalogue" of
types of failures that could happen. Those would be both documented in
plain english and also have some instrumentation in the code to produce
a clear error/message.

  E.g.: "Device 'foo' failed to migrate because of error type X: the src
  machine provided more state than the dst was expecting around the
  value Y".

And that "error type X" would come with some docs listing examples of
other similar errors and what strategies we suggest do deal with them.

Currently most migration failures are just a completely helpless:
"blergh, error -5". And the only thing we can say about it upfront is
"well, something must have changed in the stream".

Real migration failures I have seen recently (all fixed already):

1- Some feature bit was mistakenly removed from an arm cpu. Migration
   complains about a 'length' field being different.

2- A group of devices was moved from the machine init to the cpu init on
   pseries. Migration spews some nonsense about an "index".

3- Recent (invalid) bug on -cpu max on arm, a couple of bits were set in
   a register. Migration barfs incomprehensibly with: "error while
   loading state for instance 0x0 of device 'cpu', Operation not
   permitted".

So I bet we could improve these error cases to be a bit more predictable
and that would help device developers to be able to maintain migration
compatibility without making it seem like an arbitrary, hard to achieve
requirement.

Fair enough.

Do you think we may not be able to always ensure that the user can get
out of the broken version? Or do you simply think that's too much work?

I think I agree with you. It's better to have a clear statement of what
we support and make sure that works, rather than having _some_ scenarios
where the user _may_ need to shutdown the VM and _some_ where they _may_
be able to migrate out of the situation. It creates a confusing message
that I imagine would just cause people to avoid using migration
altogether.

Looks good.

The point about the guest behavior influence is something that Juan has
mentioned as a blocker for testing with static data. I don't think it
would be impossible to have some unit testing at the vmstate with some
artificial values, but it might be too much work to be worth it.
