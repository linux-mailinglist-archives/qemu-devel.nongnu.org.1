The current test design is flawed. It's based on a premise that doesn't happen, i.e.
a new temp dir will be created every time the test suit is executed. In reality the
temp dir is created only once in the constructor of the test, at the start of qos-test
(tests/qtest/qos-test.c, run_one_test()) and removed only once at the destructor
at the end of the run.

It's not possible to add a 'device name' in the created temp dir because we're too early
in the process, the tests didn't start at that point. So, with the current temp dir design,
the tests needs to clean themselves up after each run.

Here's the alternatives I'm willing to go for:

- what I just sent in v2;

- add cleanups in all existing tests. We can keep all of them, but the 'create' tests
will be carbon copies of the 'unlinkat' tests but with different names. Can be done;

- if we really want the tests untouched we can rework how the 'temp dir' is created/deleted.
The test dir will be created and removed after each test via the 'before' callback. To be
honest this seems like the best approach we can take, aside from what I did in v2, and
it's on par with how tests like vhost-user-test.c works.

Daniel
