I don't care strongly.  Maybe we should ask for a spec clarification as I doubt
implementations will be consistent on this given the vague description and that
Linux ignores it today.

I'm fine with the field, but not the value.  As far as I can tell form the spec, it should
be a mask, not a single bit.
