The GPA / IOVA are ordered but we're looking by QEMU's vaddr.

If we have these translations:
[0x1000, 0x2000] -> [0x10000, 0x11000]
[0x2000, 0x3000] -> [0x6000, 0x7000]

We will see them in this order, so we cannot stop the search at the first n=
ode.

No, it is just simplicity. We already have an user in the hot patch in
the master branch, vhost_svq_vring_write_descs. But I never profiled
enough to find if it is a bottleneck or not to be honest.

I'll send the new series by today, thank you for finding these issues!
