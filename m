Thank you for taking the time to clarify for this for me, I appreciate it.

I spent some time yesterday and this morning working this over in my 
head. I believe I understand what you're trying to do here and it makes 
more sense than employing a data structure like a hash table for this 
kind of job. However, I have a few questions regarding this implementation.

So, one question is on the reuse of the VirtQueue's used_elems array. 
Wont reusing this array cause issues with packed VQ operations, since it 
also uses this array? If we want to stick with using this array 
specifically, perhaps we may need to rewrite its logic if the device has 
negotiated the in_order feature? E.g.

virtqueue_packed_flush (...) {
    if (virtio_vdev_has_feature(vdev, VIRTIO_F_IN_ORDER) {
       // new logic
    } else {
      // current logic
    }
}
-----------

Regarding this paragraph:

"virtqueue_fill is called first with elem2. So vq->used_elems[2 %
vq->num] is filled with the needed information of the descriptor:
index, len and ndescs. idx function parameter is ignored."

This looks exactly like virtqueue_packed_fill except for the idx 
parameter we'd pass in (sequence_num % vq->vring.num).

In any case, regardless of whether this element being passed in is 
considered to be in-order or not, we still add this element to 
vq->used_elems in virtqueue_fill. Ok, got it.

Then you say "Optionally, virtqueue_push is called". I assume by 
"optionally" you mean we need to know if this is a single-shot operation 
or a batched operation. A single-shot operation would call for 
virtqueue_push whereas a batched operation would just use 
virtqueue_fill. If this is what you meant by that then ok, I understand 
that too.

However, I think before we start considering whether or not we need to 
call virtqueue_push or continue with virtqueue_fill, we first should 
know whether or not this element is in-order. And I think to do that we 
should use the check you mentioned:

if (vq->used_elems[vq->used_idx].in_num + 
vq->used_elems[vq->used_idx].out_num > 0)

or perhaps:

if (vq->used_elems[vq->used_idx] != NULL)

If the element is found not to be in-order, I assume we return and we 
are done with the handling of this element for now.

Now my confusion with this part comes from calling virtqueue_push inside 
of the virtqueue_fill function. Wouldn't calling virtqueue_push inside 
of virtqueue_fill present some kind of recursive execution path? Unless 
I'm missing something here, this probably isn't something we need to do, 
right?
-----------

Lastly, when execution reaches virtqueue_flush, what would define an 
element as unused? Perhaps...

if (vq->used_elems[i] == NULL)

or

if (vq->used_elems[i].in_num + vq->used_elems[i].out_num > 0)

Thanks Eugenio!
