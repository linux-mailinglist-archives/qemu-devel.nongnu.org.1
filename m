Thanks a lot for the analysis. Probably ir works on real machine due to 
cache effects so maybe it was just luck this did not break.

I think I had to fix a similar issue in AROS years ago when I've first 
tried to make sam460ex emulation work and used AROS for testing:
https://github.com/aros-development-team/AROS/commit/586a8ada8a5b861a77cab177d39e01de8c3f4cf5

I can't fix MorphOS as it's not open source but hope MorphOS people will 
get to know about this and do something with it. It still works better on 
other emulated machines such as pegasos2 and mac99 so it's not a big deal, 
just wanted to make sure it would not be a bug that could affect other 
OSes on sam460ex.

Thank you,
