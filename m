Yes I meant this. Or maybe some other external binary protocol like protobuf.

yes. Too much work with little benefit..

another thought:

We have QAPI protocol, with quite good schema description, and we can add
new optional fields to structures, and backward compatibility works.

Maybe, we can migrate a QAPI generated structures? Then we may describe
state of devices in QAPI..

Just note: working with QEMU's migration protocol and QAPI for years,
I can say that QAPI is a lot simpler in:
- implementing new features in backward compatible style
- maintaining downstream-only features

Still, QAPI is not good for passing big chunks of raw data, like memory pages.
