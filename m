Hello,

I am unable to find the patch-set I sent on 30th September in the qemu-deve=
l
mailing list archives. I am checking internally with my company=E2=80=99s I=
T
department,
but in the meantime, could you please advise on possible reasons why it may
not
have appeared on the list?

Any leads would be much appreciated.

Best regards,
Salil

 the<br>
compute capacity on demand by adding or removing vCPUs. The interface is si=

in look-and-feel to the vCPU hotplug feature supported on x86 platforms. Wh=
ile<br>
this series for Arm platforms shares the end goal with x86, it is implement=
ed<br>
differently because of inherent differences in the CPU architecture and the=
<br>
constraints it imposes.<br>
<br>
In this implementation, the meaning of &quot;CPU hotplug&quot; is as descri=
bed in the Arm<br>
Power State Coordination Interface (PSCI) specification (DEN0022F.b, =C2=A7=
4.3 &quot;CPU<br>
hotplug and secondary CPU boot&quot;, =C2=A75.5, 5.6). This definition has =
not changed.<br>
On Arm platforms, the guest kernel itself can request CPU onlining or offli=
ning<br>
using PSCI calls (via SMC/HVC), since the CPU_ON and CPU_OFF functions are =
part<br>
of the standard PSCI interface exposed to the non-secure world.<br>
<br>
This patch series instead adds the infrastructure required to implement<br>
administrative policy control in QEMU/VMM (as privileged software) along wi=
th<br>
the ability to convey changes via ACPI to the guest kernel. This ensures th=
e<br>
guest is notified of compute capacity changes that result from per-vCPU<br>
administrative policy. This is conceptually similar to the traditional CPU<=
br>
hotplug mechanism that x86 follows. It allows or denies guest-initiated PSC=
I<br>
CPU_ON/OFF requests by enabling or disabling an already ACPI-described and<=
br>
present vCPU via HMP/QMP &#39;device_set&#39; (a new interface), making it =
(un)available<br>
to the guest kernel. This provides the look-and-feel of vCPU hotplug throug=
h<br>
ACPI _STA.Enabled toggling, while keeping all vCPUs enumerated in ACPI tabl=
es at<br>
boot.<br>
<br>
Unlike x86, where vCPUs can become not-present after boot and the kernel (m=
aybe<br>
because architecture allows this?) tolerates some level of dynamic topology=
<br>
changes, the Arm CPU Architecture requires that the number of vCPUs and the=
ir<br>
associated redistributors remain fixed once the system has booted. Conseque=
ntly,<br>
the Arm host kernel and guest kernel do not tolerate removal or addition of=
 CPU<br>
objects after boot.<br>
<br>
Offline vCPUs remain described to guest firmware and OSPM, and can be broug=
ht<br>
online later by toggling the ACPI _STA Enabled bit. This model aligns with<=
br>
ACPI 6.5 (Table 5.37, GICC CPU Interface Flags), which introduced the &quot=
;Online<br>
Capable&quot; bit to signal processors that can be enabled at runtime. It i=
s also<br>
consistent with the Arm GIC Architecture Specification (IHI0069H, =C2=A711.=
1), which<br>
defines CPU interface power domain behavior.<br>
<br>
Corresponding kernel changes from James Morse (ARM) have already been accep=
ted<br>
and are part of the mainline Linux kernel since 6.11 release.<br>

(II) Motivation<br>
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br>
<br>
Adds virtual CPU hot-plug-like support for ARMv8+ Arch in QEMU. Allows vCPU=
s to<br>
be brought online or offline after VM boot, similar to x86 arch, while keep=
ing<br>
all CPU resources provisioned and described at startup. Enables scaling gue=
st VM<br>
compute capacity on demand, useful in several scenarios:<br>
<br>
1. Vertical Pod Autoscaling [9][10] in the cloud: As part of an orchestrati=
on<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0framework, resource requests (CPU and memory) for containers i=
n a pod can be<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0adjusted dynamically based on usage.<br>
<br>
2. Pay-as-you-grow business model: Infrastructure providers may allocate an=
d<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0restrict the total compute resources available to a guest VM a=
ccording to<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0the SLA (Service Level Agreement). VM owners can then request =
additional<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0CPUs to be hot-plugged at extra cost.<br>
<br>
In Kubernetes environments, workloads such as Kata Container VMs often adop=
t<br>
a &quot;hot-plug everything&quot; model: start with the minimum resources a=
nd add vCPUs<br>
later as needed. For example, a VM may boot with just one vCPU, then scale =
up<br>
once the workload is provisioned. This approach provides:<br>
<br>
1. Faster boot times, and<br>
2. Lower memory footprint.<br>
<br>
vCPU hot-plug is therefore one of the steps toward realizing the broader<br=
>
&quot;hot-plug everything&quot; objective. Other hot-plug mechanisms alread=
y exist on ARM,<br>
such as ACPI-based memory hot-plug and PCIe device hot-plug, and are suppor=
ted<br>
in both QEMU and the Linux guest. Extending vCPU hot-plug in this series al=
igns<br>
with those efforts and fills the remaining gap.<br>

(III) Background<br>
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br>
<br>
The ARM architecture does not support physical CPU hot-plug and lacks a<br>
specification describing the behavior of per-CPU components (e.g. GIC CPU<b=
r>
interface, redistributors, PMUs, timers) when such events occur. As a resul=
t,<br>
both host and guest kernels are intolerant to changes in the number of CPUs=
<br>
enumerated by firmware and described by ACPI at boot time.<br>
<br>
We need to respect these architectural constraints and the kernel limitatio=
ns<br>
they impose, namely the inability to tolerate changes in the number of CPUs=
<br>
enumerated by firmware once the system has booted, and create a practical<b=
r>
solution with workarounds in the VMM/QEMU.<br>
<br>
This patch set implements a non-intrusive solution by provisioning all vCPU=
<br>
resources during VM initialization and exposing them via ACPI to the guest<=
br>
kernel. The resources remain fixed, while the effect of hot-plug is achieve=
d by<br>
toggling ACPI CPU status (enabled) bits to bring vCPUs online or offline.<b=

<br>
A. Physical Limitation to Support CPU Hotplug: (Architectural Constraint)<b=
r>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A01. ARMv8 CPU architecture does not support the concept of the =
physical CPU<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 hotplug. <br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 a. There are many per-CPU components like PMU, SVE, MT=
E, Arch timers, etc.,<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0whose behavior needs to be clearly define=
d when the CPU is<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0hot(un)plugged. Current specification doe=
s not define this nor are any<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0immediate plans from ARM to extend suppor=
t for such a feature.<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A02. Other ARM components like GIC, etc., have not been designed=
 to realize<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 physical CPU hotplug capability as of now. For example=
,<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 a. Every physical CPU has a unique GICC (GIC CPU Inter=
face) by construct.<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Architecture does not specify what CPU ho=
t(un)plug would mean in<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0context to any of these.<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 b. CPUs/GICC are physically connected to unique GICR (=
GIC Redistributor).<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0GIC Redistributors are always part of the=
 always-on power domain. Hence,<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0they cannot be powered off as per specifi=
cation.<br>
<br>
B. Limitation in Firmware/ACPI (Architectural Constraint)<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A01. Firmware has to expose GICC, GICR, and other per-CPU featur=
es like PMU,<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 SVE, MTE, Arch Timers, etc., to the OS. Due to the arc=
hitectural constraint<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 stated in section A1(a), all interrupt controller stru=
ctures of<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 MADT describing GIC CPU Interfaces and the GIC Redistr=
ibutors MUST be<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 presented by firmware to the OSPM during boot time.<br=
>
=C2=A0 =C2=A02. Architectures that support CPU hotplug can evaluate the ACP=
I _MAT method<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 to get this kind of information from the firmware even=
 after boot, and the<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 OSPM has the capability to process these. ARM kernel u=
ses information in<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 MADT interrupt controller structures to identify the n=
umber of present CPUs<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 during boot and hence does not allow to change these a=
fter boot. The number<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 of present CPUs cannot be changed. It is an architectu=
ral constraint!<br>
<br>
C. Limitations in KVM to Support Virtual CPU Hotplug (Architectural Constra=
int)<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A01. KVM VGIC:<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 a. Sizing of various VGIC resources like memory region=
s, etc., related to<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0the redistributor happens only once and i=
s fixed at the VM init time<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0and cannot be changed later after initial=
ization has happened.<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0KVM statically configures these resources=
 based on the number of vCPUs<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0and the number/size of redistributor rang=
es.<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 b. Association between vCPU and its VGIC redistributor=
 is fixed at the<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0VM init time within the KVM, i.e., when r=
edistributor iodevs gets<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0registered. VGIC does not allow to setup/=
change this association<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0after VM initialization has happened. Phy=
sically, every CPU/GICC is<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0uniquely connected with its redistributor=
, and there is no<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0architectural way to set this up.<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A02. KVM vCPUs:<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 a. Lack of specification means destruction of KVM vCPU=
s does not exist as<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0there is no reference to tell what to do =
with other per-vCPU<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0components like redistributors, arch time=
r, etc.<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 b. In fact, KVM does not implement the destruction of =
vCPUs for any<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0architecture. This is independent of whet=
her the architecture<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0actually supports CPU Hotplug feature. Fo=
r example, even for x86 KVM<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0does not implement the destruction of vCP=
Us.<br>
<br>
D. Considerations in Qemu due to ARM CPU Architecture &amp; related KVM Con=
straints:<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A01. Qemu CPU Objects MUST be created to initialize all the Host=
 KVM vCPUs to<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 overcome the KVM constraint. KVM vCPUs are created and=
 initialized when<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Qemu CPU Objects are realized.<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A02. The &#39;GICV3State&#39; and &#39;GICV3CPUState&#39; object=
s must be sized for all possible<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 vCPUs at VM initialization, when the QOM GICv3 object =
is realized. This is<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 required because the KVM VGIC can only be initialized =
once, and the number<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 of redistributors, their per-vCPU interfaces, and asso=
ciated data<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 structures or I/O device regions are all fixed at VM i=
nit time.<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A03. How should new QOM CPU objects be connected back to the &#3=
9;GICV3CPUState&#39;<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 objects and disconnected from it in case the CPU is be=
ing hot(un)plugged?<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A04. How should &#39;unplugged&#39; or &#39;yet-to-be-plugged&#3=
9; vCPUs be represented in the<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 QOM for which KVM vCPU already exists? For example, wh=
ether to keep,<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0a. No QOM CPU objects Or<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0b. Unrealized CPU Objects<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A05. How should vCPU state be exposed via ACPI to the Guest? Esp=
ecially for<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 the unplugged/yet-to-be-plugged vCPUs whose CPU object=
s might not exist<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 within the QOM but the Guest always expects all possib=
le vCPUs to be<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 identified as ACPI *present* during boot.<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A06. How should Qemu expose GIC CPU interfaces for the unplugged=
 or<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 yet-to-be-plugged vCPUs using ACPI MADT Table to the G=
uest?<br>
<br>
E. How are the above questions addressed in this QEMU implementation?<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A01. Respect the limitations imposed by the Arm architecture in =
KVM, ACPI, and<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 the guest kernel. This requires always keeping the vCP=
U count constant.<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A02. Implement a workaround in QEMU by keeping all vCPUs present=
 and toggling<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 the ACPI _STA.Enabled bit to realize a vCPU hotplug-li=

=C2=A0 =C2=A04. Size other per-vCPU components, such as the VGIC CPU interf=

<br>
1. TCG currently faces some hang issues due to unhandled cases. We aim to f=
ix<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0these within the next one to two weeks.<br>
2. Comprehensive testing is ongoing. This is fresh code, and we expect to<b=
r>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0complete testing within two weeks.<br>
3. QEMU documentation (.rst) still needs to be updated.<br>
4. Migration has been lightly tested but is working as expected.<br>
5. Mitigation to avoid `pause_all_vcpus` needs broader community discussion=
. An<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0alternative change has been prepared in KVM, which maintains a=
 shadow of<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0`ICC_CTLR_EL1` to reduce lock contention when using KVM device=
 IOCTLs. This<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0avoids synchronization issues if the register value changes du=
ring VM runtime.<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0While not mandatory, this enhancement would provide a more com=
prehensive fix<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0than the current QEMU assumption that the relevant fields are =
invariant or<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0pseudo-static. An RFC for this KVM change will be floated with=
in a week.<br>
6. Mitigation of parking disabled vCPU threads in user space, to avoid bloc=
king<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0them inside KVM, needs review by the wider community to ensure=
 no hidden<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0issues are introduced.<br>
7. A discussion (if needed) on why `device_set` was chosen instead of `qom-=
set`<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0for administrative state control.<br>
8. CPU_SUSPEND/Standy related handling (if required)<br>
9. HVF and qtest are not supported or done yet.<br>

<br>
This patch-set is the culmination of over four years of ongoing effort to b=
ring<br>
a vCPU hotplug-like feature to the Arm platform. The work has already led t=
o<br>
changes in the ACPI specification and the Linux kernel, and this series now=
<br>
introduces the missing piece within QEMU.<br>
<br>
The transition from RFC v5 to RFC v6 resulted in a shift of approach, based=
 on<br>
maintainer feedback, and required substantial code to be re-written. This i=
s<br>
*not* production-level code and may still contain bugs. Comprehensive testi=
ng is<br>
in progress on HiSilicon Kunpeng920 SoCs, Oracle servers, and Ampere platfo=
rms.<br>
We expect to fix outstanding issues in the coming month and, subject to no =
major<br>
concerns from maintainers about the chosen approach, a near-stable, non-RFC=
<br>
version will be posted soon.<br>
<br>
This work largely follows the direction of prior community discussions over=
 the<br>
years [see refs below], including mailing list threads, Linaro Open Discuss=
ions,<br>
and sessions at KVM Forum. This RFC is intended to validate the overall app=
roach<br>
outlined here and to gather community feedback before moving forward with a=
<br>
formal patch series.<br>
<br>
[The concept being presented has been found to work!]<br>
