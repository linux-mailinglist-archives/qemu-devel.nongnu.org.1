The exception process is a second thought in QEMU's policy for AI-generated
content.  It is not really possible to understand how people want to use
these tools without formalizing it a bit more and encouraging people to
request exceptions if they see a good use for AI-generated content.

Note that right now, in my opinion, the exception process remains
infeasible, because there is no agreement on how to "demonstrate
clarity of the license and copyright status for the tool's output".
This will be sorted out separately.

What is missing: do we want a formal way to identify commits for which an
exception to the AI policy was granted?  The common way to do so seems to
be "Generated-by" or "Assisted-by" but I don't want to turn commit message
into an ad space.  I would lean more towards something like

  AI-exception-granted-by: Mary Maintainer <mary.maintainer@mycorp.test>

but at the same time I don't want to invent something just for QEMU.
