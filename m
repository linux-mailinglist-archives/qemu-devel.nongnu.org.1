Right, It's not expected behavior to map ambiguous CPU model names to
the fixed CPU typename.

I put this into class 3, meaning the PVRs are regarded as aliases to CPU
typenames.

I have to clarify the type->model mapping has been existing since the
model->type mapping was introduced with the help of CPU_RESOLVING_TYPE.
I mean the logic has been existing since the existence of CPU_RESOLVING_TYPE,
even the code wasn't there.

I'm not sure about the idea to switch to '-cpu <cpu-type-name>' since
it was rejected by Peter Maydell before. Hope Peter can double confirm
for this. For me, the shorter name is beneficial. For example, users
needn't to have '-cpu host-arm-cpu' for '-cpu host'.

I need more context about 'deprecation process' here. My understanding
is both CPU typename and model name will be accepted for a fixed period
of time. However, a warning message will be given to indicate that the
model name will be obsoleted soon. Eventually, we switch to CPU typename
completely. Please correct me if there are anything wrong.

I'm afraid that list_cpus() is hard to be reused. All available CPU model names
are listed by list_cpus(). mc->valid_cpu_types[] are just part of them and variable
on basis of boards. Generally speaking, we need a function to do reverse things
as to CPUClass::class_by_name(). So I would suggest to introduce CPUClass::model_from_type(),
as below. Could you please suggest if it sounds reasonable to you?

- CPUClass::class_by_name() is modified to
   char *CPUClass::model_to_type(const char *model)

- char *CPUClass::type_to_model(const char *type)

- CPUClass::type_to_model() is used in cpu_list() for every target when CPU
   model name, fetched from CPU type name, is printed in xxx_cpu_list_entry()

- CPUClass::type_to_model() is reused in hw/core/machine.c to get the CPU
   model name from CPU type names in mc->valid_cpu_types[].

Thanks,
Gavin
