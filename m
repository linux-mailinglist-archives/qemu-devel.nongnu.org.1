I agree, an excellent motivation.

I curious what the split between PCIe and platform devices that need an
SMMU are. I suspect there is a strong split between the virtualisation
case and the emulation case.

What about other IOMMU's? Are there any other bus mediating devices
modelled in QEMU that could also benefit from the ability to trigger DMA
transactions?

his is a key improvement, as the test setup extensively re-uses the same se=

 S1/S2 walks, CD fetch). The new comments explain this sharing mechanism, w=
