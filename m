Hello,

QEMU is an emulator. It is emulating the RV64 instruction set (and
extensions) on your host (which I would guess is x86). It is basically
processing the RV64 instruction and decoding it to relevant x86
instructions and then running those.

BOOM, Rocket or other CPU designs are instead CPU hardware designs, in
VHDL, Verilog or other design languages. They are unrelated to QEMU.
QEMU can model the same extensions that the hardware supports, but
QEMU can not model the actual CPU designs. For that you would want
something like Verilator or an FPGA. This also applies to pipeline
stages, QEMU isn't modelling the CPU, but instead translating
instructions.

So QEMU is not going to help model variations in the CPU design.

The same here. QEMU doesn't have branch predictors or other hardware
only things, it only models what the software sees.

Don't use QEMU for this. Your best bet is to use Verilator to model
the hardware changes. Although I'm no expert in hardware design.
