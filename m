It means I'm not sure. We end up with a subdirectory with only
one file in it and where there's no expectation we'd ever want
to add any more files to it. On the other hand it does keep it
out of the docs/ top level directory, which currently has a
fair amount of cruft awaiting cleanup.

I guess on balance I would make this docs/glossary.rst,
unless you anticipate wanting to split this into multiple
files or have something else in docs/glossary/ later.

You could phrase it as "presents brief definitions of acronyms
and terms", I think.

An SoC is a "system on chip". To quote wikipedia's definition:

"A system on a chip or system-on-chip is an integrated circuit that
integrates most or all components of a computer or electronic system.
These components usually include an on-chip central processing unit
(CPU), memory interfaces, input/output devices and interfaces, and
secondary storage interfaces, often alongside other components such
as radio modems and a graphics processing unit (GPU) =E2=80=93 all on a
single substrate or microchip."

An SoC always contains a CPU, but it will have a lot more
than that built into it too. And the SoC only has "most"
of the system components, so the whole machine will be
an SoC plus some other things.

Generally a board/machine that uses an SoC will have on it:
 * an SoC
 * the actual memory
 * perhaps one or two extra devices external to the SoC
 * connectors for things like serial ports, SD cards, etc
   (which generally wire up to SoC pins)
 * a crystal or similar to act as the main clock source

So if you look at a photo of a development board that uses
an SoC, there will be one large chip which is the SoC,
some RAM chips, a bunch of connectors and one or two smaller
chips. Not every device will be inside the SoC, but
generally almost all of them are.

QEMU's machine models for this kind of board match the
organization of the hardware; looking at hw/arm/sabrelite.c
which is a machine model you can see that it has:
 * an instance of the fsl-imx6 SoC device object
 * the main memory
 * some NOR flash memory
 * some configuration and wiring up of things

And the SoC itself is in hw/arm/fsl-imx6.c, and is a
QOM device object that creates and wires up the CPUs,
UARTs, USB controller, and various other devices that
this particular SoC includes. In this case we only have
one board model using this SoC, but for some SoCs we
have several board models that all use the same SoC
but wire up different external devices to it.

Some of our machine models are models of systems that
don't use an SoC at all. This is rare in the Arm world,
but for instance the SPARC machines like the SS-5 are
like that -- the real hardware had a discrete CPU chip
and a bunch of devices in their own chips on the
motherboard, and QEMU's model of that hardware has
a machine model which directly creates the CPU and
the various devices. (And some of our older machine
models are models of hardware that *does* have an SoC
but where we didn't model that level of abstraction,
so they directly create devices in the machine model
that really ought to be inside an SoC object.
hw/arm/stellaris.c is one example of that.)

Yeah, the driver vs device split is a good one (basically
the device is the front-end visible to the guest, and the
driver is the back-end that provides it with storage
via an abstracted API). The nit I'm picking here is that
not every block driver is there to provide support for
an on-host disk format.

We could say, perhaps:

In QEMU, a device is a piece of hardware visible to the guest.
Examples include UARTs, PCI controllers, PCI cards, VGA controllers,
and many more.

No. patchwork is patchwork, and patchew is patchew -- these
are entirely different pieces of software that happen to do
similar jobs.

We don't use patchwork, so we don't need to mention it anywhere.

I have no idea -- you'd need to ask somebody who works on the
block layer
