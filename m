The UEFI spec clearly states that runtime services must either be
called using a 1:1 mapping, or via a virtual remapping but in that
case, SetVirtualAddresMap() must be called to inform the firmware of
the new virtual mapping.

Even if this is not clearly stated, this violates the intent of the
UEFI spec: the code reasons about mappings of physical memory,
implying that the mapping is the only thing that changes. Moving
memory contents around can only be done safely after
SetVirtualAddressMap(), making it mandatory on these systems, whereas
the spec clearly states that it is entirely optional.

But whatever OSX does on x86 is irrelevant anyway: it is vertically
integrated with the firmware, which is vaguely EFI based but does not
aim for spec compliance. The OSX EULA does not permit running it on
anything other than Apple hardware. And x86 Apple hardware will be
reaching obsolescence pretty soon, at least where future development
is concerned.

My colleague filed a USWG proposal for a EFI_MEMORY_SHARED attribute
that must be honored by the OS when creating runtime mappings, and map
the region in a way that allows access by another observer (typically
the VMM but semantically it could mean other things too)

Indeed. Presenting memory as MMIO just to trick the guest into mapping
it shared is not the right approach here, which is why we need
EFI_MEMORY_SHARED on ARM. On x86, using the EfiMemoryMappedIo type
happens to work, but it is a hack (e.g., you cannot allocate memory of
this type)
