I'm not thrilled about how we're able to disable profiles either. I'm
coping with it because (1) it was a feedback from the first version of
this work [1] and no one had strong opinions against it back then and
(2) I believe that users won't find much use in doing "-cpu rv64,profileA=false"
in a real world/common scenario, so we can get away with this kind of
weird functionality.

The profile flag is set to 'false' by default for all current CPUs. If
the user manually sets it to 'false', well, it doesn't change the internal
state of the CPU, does it? But then I need to be creative and interpret it
as 'it's not a default false, it's an user-set false, so I need to disable
extensions'. I can't think of many qemu options that behave like that, if
any.

We also have the example of RVG, a bit that is default set to 'false' that,
when enabled, causes IMAFD_zicsr_zifencei to be enabled. Today, if the user
set RVG to 'false', nothing happens - we're not disabling IMAFD_zicsr_zifencei.
In the latest version of this work there's a deliberate effort to make RVG
behave like a profile [2], but perhaps I should make profiles behave like RVG.

Last but not the least, I'm planning to add a couple of bare-bones CPUs (rv64i
and rv64e). Disabling profiles in these CPUs is a total waste of cycles since
the CPUs are already bare.

After writing all this stuff, and realizing that profile disablement creates a
lot of confusion and has no vocal fans, I had a change of heart. Profiles will
behave like RVG -> if set, mandatory extensions will be enabled (respecting user
choice on disabled extensions, of course). If disabled, nothing happens. Fans
of the current design are welcome to weight in the discussion, of course.

If we decide in the future that stripping extensions from a CPU model is desirable
we can come up with a 'bare' option, e.g. "-cpu rv64,bare=true" will strip all
extensions from rv64. This is a much cleaner way of doing what profile disablement
is currently doing.


Thanks,


Daniel
