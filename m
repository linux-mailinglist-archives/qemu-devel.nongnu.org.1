Image loading is already weird and inconsistent across
architectures and across machines. I'm not really
enthusiastic about adding an extra thing that only
applies to one machine type.

You might be able to get the effect you want by writing a
guest binary that does the things the boot-rom does before
starting the main executable, and telling QEMU to load
both that "bootrom/bios" ELF file and the main ELF file.
