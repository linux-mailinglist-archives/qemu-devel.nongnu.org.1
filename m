Right.  We may need something like multifd_send_should_exit() +
MultiFDSendParams.sem.  It'll be nicer if we can generalize that part so
multifd threads can also rebase to that thread model, but maybe I'm asking
too much.

Oh I thought you already started modifying his patchset.

In this case, AFAIR Fabiano has plan to rework that RFC series, so maybe
you want to double check with him, and can also wait for his new version if
that's easier, because I do expect there'll be major changes.

Fabiano?
