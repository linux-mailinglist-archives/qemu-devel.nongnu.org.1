In my other (huge) reply to this thread I tried to provide that
analysis by imagining how I would want to consume a QEMU API in
Go, creating an example application and trying to see how well
it fits with this design.

IIUC, the intent is that we dn't generate the go code as part of the
regular QEMU build. IOW, most of the time it would be generate once
against a release tag. If someone was actively working on QAPI schema
on git master, at the same time as developing a Go application, they'll
have a bit more of a repeated compile penalty. I'm not convinced that's
a big enough common case to worry about modularizing though.

With the monolothic go code, generated once per release tag, Go is
going to be reusing cached previously compiled objects most of the
time. I think that's likely to be good enough.

With regards,
Daniel
