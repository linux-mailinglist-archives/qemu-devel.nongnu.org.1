Though I do wonder if we can do something about the slight performance
degradation that Sanjay reported. We seem to stay well under the hard
limit, so the reduced global pool size shouldn't be the issue. Maybe
it's the locking?

Either way, even though it could be called a fix, I don't think this is
for 9.0, right?

Kevin
