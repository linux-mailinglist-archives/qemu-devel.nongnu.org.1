The HMP monitor flushes at each newline,  and exit() will take care of
flushing stdout, so I don't think there's anything else needed.

'skip_flush' is only set to 'true' when using a QMP monitor and invoking
"hmp-monitor-command".

In such a case, the error message needs to be built into a JSON error
reply and sent over the socket. Your patch doesn't help this case
since you've just printed to stderr.  I don't think it is reasonable
to expect QMP monitors to send replies on SIG_ABRT anyway. So I don't
think the skip_flush=true scenario is a problem to be concerned with.

This is still doomed, because SIGABRT could fire while 'mon_lock' is
already held, and so this code would deadlock trying to acquire the
lock.

That's a bit of a crazy exaggeration. THe aborts() don't cover 50 different
subsystems, and we don't require explicit acks from every subsystem maintainer
for trivial cleanups like this.

If that was a real problem, then we already face it because we have
~500 places already calling exit() and only 50 calling abort().

Just replace abort -> exit.

I'm not seeing a need for an atexit handler on top.
