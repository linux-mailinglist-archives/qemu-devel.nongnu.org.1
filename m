Cool, we have a culprit now :-) I see the ticket is closed, I will
reopen it. Are there known implementation challenges that caused the fix
postponing or do we "just" need someone with free cycles to carry out
the task. By the way FYI, we have other tickets opened related to vSMMU
and virtio devices also happening during reboot.

Thanks
