Can we make the two approaches mutually exclusive ? Taking your
'migrate' command example addition:

  { 'command': 'migrate',
    'data': {'*uri': 'str',
             '*channels': [ 'MigrationChannel' ],
  +          '*config': 'MigrationConfig',
             '*detach': 'bool', '*resume': 'bool' } }

if 'migrate' is invoked with the '*config' data being non-nil,
then we should ignore *all* global state previously set with
migrate-set-XXXX, and exclusively use '*config'.

That gives a clean semantic break between old and new approaches,
without us having to worry about removing the existing commands
quickly.

'-incoming defer' still gets paired with 'migrate-incoming' on the
target, so no matter what, there's no reason to ever pass parameters
on the CLI with '-incoming defer'.
