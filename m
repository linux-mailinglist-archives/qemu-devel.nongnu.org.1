Maybe there is a misunderstanding on my side, but it seems that what you 
asked is exactly patch 7, which introduce DEFINE_MACHINE_WITH_INTERFACES.

That said, patch 4 ("hw/core/null-machine: Define machine as generic QOM 
type") could use it to define the null machine. Philippe, could you 
change patch 4 to use DEFINE_MACHINE_WITH_INTERFACES instead?

Thanks,
