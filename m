I don't think we want this capability. I guess we would support

I am scared about the overall implementation/test matrix. Can we afford
supporting that many setups, revision based models, named models with
all kinds of features optim-in/opt-out. We should also keep in mind what
is our current goal, ie. supporting migration between different machines
but still with sufficient commonalities.

Shouldn't we try to collect community needs in that regard. I don't know
if people will/can tell us what they want to migrate from/to. At least
do the machines comply with the same spec rev or how large is the gap.
How many ID regs/features do mismatch in general. Are those ID regs
currently writable? What would be the best grouping model for them?

Also many ID regs are not writable, because we have not turned them yet
as writable or because they are not that much a problem at the moment.
Maybe some features are not fully turned as writable. I mean some ID
regs they depend on are but not all of them.

So maybe we should reduce the complexity by reducing the scope to the 16
writable regs we have atm (~ 126 writable ID reg fields).

Another big question I think is how the upper layer will detect the
relevance of a named model and associated feature. We saw that

/proc/cpuinfo was not that much consistent with FEAT_xxx terminology. Many other features can't be queried I guess. I think it is also part of the problematic. Is it worth exposing stuff that cannot be simply introspected?
