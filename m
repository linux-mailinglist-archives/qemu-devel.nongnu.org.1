To close the loop on this, it looks like the issue was a corner case in a s=
eries of bridged legacy PCI 2.2 devices, and that the remaining issues were=
 the result of a specific interaction between the INTx hardware and INTx gu=
est mode devices. [1]  PCI 2.3+ and PCIe devices use a different interrupt =
signalling mechanism (INTx with DisINTx+, or MSI), and would not be affecte=
d.

With the linked patch, XIVE on XIVE works fairly well, even with the legacy=
 PCI 2.2 devices.

The one remaining issue is that we tend to generate a lot of spurious IRQs =
due to all of the INTx handshaking between the host and guest XIVEs; if the=
 H_INT_ESB hypercall is issued by the guest before the VFIO interrupt is ac=
knowledged by QEMU (i.e. while the emulated INTx line is still asserted and=
, thus, the host INTx line is still masked), we get an extra unwanted INTx =
IRQ generated in the guest.  This is mostly harmless aside from causing the=
 spurious interrupt counters to increase, but as it is apparently caused by=
 a race condition between guest IRQ completion and host QEMU VFIO acknowled=
ge it doesn't look particularly simple to fix.
