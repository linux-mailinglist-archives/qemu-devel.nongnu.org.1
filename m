Yeah, right, I forgot about this peculiarity.

If Mark-Andre or anyone else has no objections, I'll drop all changes
to the original front-end 'mux' (I tried to make all names and variables re=
flect
the 'front-end' nature to reduce confusion with the back-end mux) and will
resend modified series introducing a new 'hub' chardev. I will keep the
possibility to send input from several back-ends to a single front-end, as
in the current implementation.
