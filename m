IANAL, but .... :-)

The distinction of "source code" license vs "combined work" license,
is a quite normal concept. As an example, it is something that is
applied in Fedora RPM packaging when deciding the RPM spec "License:"
tag. The latter is considered to refer to the licenses on the subset
of source is said to be part of the distributed binaries, so we can
exclude licenses of any part of the source that is not compiled, and
of supporting code - eg license of makefiles, meson file, autoconf,
code is excluded from the RPM license tag.


The difference is that in most cases, the excluded part of the source
is in separate files, or less frequently could be in #ifdef sections,
whereas in this case we have two differently licensed parts of work
in the same file.

The question is thus what can you say is "compiled".

Is the whole file "compiled", or are only the souce code constructs
"compiled".

My proposition is that, in most cases, comments are not used by
the "compilation", or "code generation" phase. They are seen by
the "parsing" phase only and thus dont contribute to the contents
of the output binary code.

With C code this is easy to illustrate. Run 'gcc -save-temps' and
look at the '.i' file which is what the compiler uses as input
for code generation after cpp has run. The '.i' file is devoid of
all code comments.

I've not proved the same for golang compilers yet, but my argument
hinges on that being the true.

None the less, we have raised this position/viewpoint with experts
for a second opinion.

I don't have any particular examples. Perhaps 100% of the .go code
in the repo in question will be auto-generated. I can't predict the
future, so there's a decent chance we might end up with some basic
scaffolding and/or layered framework code that is manually written.
If such a situation arises, it is important to have anticipated this,
to make clear it is intended to be under a specific license.

Daniel
