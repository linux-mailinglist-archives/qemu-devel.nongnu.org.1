Yep.  I actually gave it a shot before posting the C++ version and it 
seems kind of fragile, just poking it boring looknig ways changes the 
behavior.  Some of that was tied up in me trying to get GCC to generate 
similar code to clang, though, so hopefully that's all manageable.  I 
certainly wouldn't want to throw something that wacky at an intern for 
their first project, though.  So I don't have a good version yet.

I'm also hoping the fuzzer reproduces some nice small examples, but no 
luck yet...
