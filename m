OK, I will change the default value to -1.

A lot of feature bits are set in x86_cpu_expand_features() with reported
value, so I think avx10_version can also be set to reported value there.

I mainly want to let avx10_version be assigned only when -cpu host or max,
so that it can be distinguished from the cpu model. This should also be
Paolo's original intention in v2.
