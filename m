Yes, absolutely. We were doing something gross as a convenience, but never
documented that it's just that, a convenience.

Agreed, hence my suggestion to just require distlib.

They are different libraries and both have their role. pip used
distlib.scripts but not distlib.version, and therefore decided to stop
shipping what it doesn't use

https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/13337
https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/13342

Using distlib is not going backwards, especially considering that we have
no other use for "packaging" in QEMU. There's no replacement for
distlib.scripts in the "packaging" library, and no official deprecation of
distlib.version. All that we would get from doing version matching with
"packaging" is requiring two dependencies instead of one (which is why John
kept the possibility to use an installed distlib).
