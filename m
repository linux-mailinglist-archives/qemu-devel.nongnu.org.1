Hello Bernhard,

thanks for interrest in the FlexCAN emulation for QEMU.

Yes, Matyas Bobek's repository with work in progress is there

  https://gitlab.fel.cvut.cz/bobekmat/qemu-flexcan

I have tested his branch in January and it worked with QEMU
iMX6 and Linux kernel driver. He is continuing the work and
we have met last week when he did rebase to something around
v10.0.0-rc1 version. I have tested with next config at that time
and I have retested int again now after update

~/repo/qemu/qemu-flexcan-build/qemu-system-arm \
      -m 1G -M sabrelite -smp 4 \
      -kernel kernel-imx6q-sabrelite \
      -dtb imx6q-sabrelite.dtb \
      -initrd ramdisk.cpio \
      -serial mon:stdio \
      -nographic \
      -object can-bus,id=canbus0-bus \
      -machine canbus0=canbus0-bus -machine canbus1=canbus0-bus \
      -object can-host-socketcan,if=can0,canbus=canbus0-bus,id=canbus0-socketcan \

There is lot of prints and debug etc... But basic functionality,
enough to allow Linux driver to work is in place.

Great. At this moment the thesis target has been only FlexCAN
for iMX6 (that is without FD) but we have discussed that
code should be designed with extension to more FlexCAN controller
in the mind. Please, discuss with colleague what he sees
as realistic at this time. He has to submit thesis text
in May... But I would be happy if project continues at CTU
or elsewhere. It would be fair to find at least some basic
funding if the student continues on the project over holidays.
I have received no money for all my QEMU work for years
nor I expect that I find funding for that at CTU or
Skoda Auto or others using our services. I can find some
small money from my reserve from other projects.
DO you have some option for funding on your side?

Or the option is GSOC, QEMU is on the list as I see.
I am already mentor at NuttX and take such role
for RTEMS probably as well, I have lot of other duties
but I can accept co-mentor, consultant role for QEMU
GSoC if there is interrest.

As for QEMU core CAN subsystem and CAN FD,
it is prepared and work well for CTU CAN FD
emulation and even AMD Versal which builds
on base of our work..

When I try

QEMU with

-virtfs local,path=shareddir,security_model=none,mount_tag=shareddir

on iMX6 sabrelite now, I can see the device on PCI/PCIe

lspci
00:00.0 Class 0604: 16c3:abcd
01:00.0 Class 0002: 1af4:1049

I can see interrupts

cat /proc/interrupts

290:          0          0          0          0   PCI-MSI 524288 Edge      virtio0-config
291:          0          0          0          0   PCI-MSI 524289 Edge      virtio0-requests

but when I try

mount -t 9p -o trans=virtio shareddir /mnt/shareddir

it stucks and no interrupts seems to arrive

cat /proc/interrupts

290:          0          0          0          0   PCI-MSI 524288 Edge      virtio0-config
291:          0          0          0          0   PCI-MSI 524289 Edge      virtio0-requests

I have tried even CTU CAN FD PCIe emulation. I can see the device on the lspci,
the first send frame passes but then it stucks. Receive does not see any mesaage.
I expect that at least on sabrelite there is something missing. May it be in
kernel devicetree or on QEMU side in PCI/PCIe interrupts.

But that is not so critical at this moment.

By the way, I would like to discuss QEMU interrupts for generic
FPGA mapping of our CTU CAN FD IP core (in addition to PCIe)

  https://github.com/ppisa/qemu/blob/net-can-ctucanfd-platform/hw/net/can/ctucan_mm.c#L144

where I have looked for help in past.
It would be very usesfull for us to have memory-mapped CTU CAN FD IP core
emulation with commad line attaching to Zynq and PolarFire...
