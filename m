misa_mxl and misa_mxl_max may be same for now, but they exist because 
they will be different in the future; otherwise there is no reason to 
have misa_mxl_max at the first place. misa_mxl represents the current 
effective value and misa_mxl_max represents the maximum value the 
emulated CPU supports.

So we need to preserve the existing choice of misa_mxl and misa_mxl_max 
in general. riscv_cpu_gdb_read_register() and 
riscv_cpu_gdb_write_register(), for example, must use misa_mxl_max 
instead of misa_mxl since GDB doesn't support changing register width at 
runtime, and the register width should match with the feature 
description provided by gdb_core_xml_file.

The use of env->misa_mxl_max in riscv_is_32bit(), however, looks not 
good to me. If a 64-bit processor is in 32-bit mode, the 32-bit kernel 
should be loaded. I added a patch to change it to env->misa_mxl in v5.

The cost of the class type check should be negligible considering that 
init_disas_context() is followed by the TCG translation, which takes 
most of execution time.
