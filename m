struct virtq_avail has two members: uint16_t idx and ring[]. To be in
the first position of the avail ring means to be in ring[0] there.

Idx and ring[] are just headers in the figure, not actual positions.
Same as Avail. Now that you mention maybe there is a better way to
represent that, yes.

Let me know if I didn't explain it well.

It is the position in ring[] where the device needs to stop looking
for descriptors. It starts at 0, and when the device sees 1 it means
ring[0] has a descriptor to process.

Now you need to apply a "modulo virtqueue size" to that index. So if
the virtqueue is 256, avail_idx 257 means the last valid descriptor is
at 0. This happens naturally when the driver keeps adding descriptors
and wraps the queue.

The authoritative source of this is the VirtQueues section of the
virtio standard [1], feel free to check it in case it clarifies
something better.

avail_idx is an uin16_t, so ((uint16_t)-1) + 1 =3D=3D 0.

That's a limitation in the standard, but I'm not sure where it comes
from beyond being computationally easier to calculate ring position
with a mask than with a remainder of a random non-power-of-two number.
Packed virtqueue removes that limitation.

For PCI devices, as long as it detects a device with vendor =3D=3D Red
Hat, Inc. (0x1AF4) and device ID 0x1000 through 0x107F inclusive, yes.
You can also load and unload manually with modprobe as other drivers.

Let me know if you have more doubts. Thanks!
