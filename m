So this behavior is interesting by itself. But L1's kernel net system
should not receive anything. As I read it, even if it receives it, it
should not forward the frame to L2 as it is in a different subnet. Are
you able to read it using tcpdump on L1?

Maybe we can make the scenario clearer by telling which virtio-net
device is which with virtio_net_pci,mac=3DXX:... ?

Can you tell with gdb bt if this function is called from net or the
SVQ subsystem?

In the vp_vdpa scenario of the blog receive_filter should not be
called in the qemu running in the L1 guest, the nested one. Can you
check it with gdb or by printing a trace if it is called?

Ok this makes sense, as x-svq=3Dtrue is the one that receives the set
mac message. You should see it in L0's QEMU though, both in x-svq=3Don
and x-svq=3Doff scenarios. Can you check it?
