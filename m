Hello,

This series cleans up and simplifies the raven model which does some
strange stuff that no other pci-host is doing and does it in a
convoluted way and also has some legacy bits that can be removed.
Apart from making the model much more readable this also fixes the
non-contiguous IO control bit which was there but did not work as it
was not connected but apparently it's not really used by any guest so
that wasn't noticed.

Regards,
BALATON Zoltan
