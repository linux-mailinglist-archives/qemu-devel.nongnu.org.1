This series is still missing changes to enable build on all targets
during CI, including cross-compiles, to prove that we're doing the
correct thing on all our targetted platforms. That's a must have
before considering it suitable for merge.

I also believe we should default to enabling rust toolchain by
default in configure, and require and explicit --without-rust
to disable it, *despite* it not technically being a mandatory
feature....yet.

This is to give users a clear message that Rust is likely to
become a fundamental part of QEMU, so they need to give feedback
if they hit any problems / have use cases we've not anticipated
that are problematic wrt Rust.

With regards,
Daniel
