The way I see having a "deprecated-props" array included in the
expansion response is that it just simply signals to the user/management
app which features are deprecated. From there, the next step to set up a
CPU model with these features turned off can be performed.

I've worked on the libvirt portion for the v1 of this QEMU patch set,
and the idea is to introduce a new CPU model type called
"host-recommended". When a libvirt domain is defined with this type,
then the CPU model will become the host-model with deprecated features
turned off.

This is, of course, a big discussion to be had once the patches are
upstream. They will be an RFC since I imagine a lot of ideas will be
thrown around.

Once the QEMU portion is accepted, I'll fix up what I have for libvirt
to properly query for the deprecated features and work them into my design.
