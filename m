Two separate interface design problems:

1. Query and manipulate complex configuration

2. Control and monitor long-running jobs

Let's start with 1.

Migration is not the only instance of complex configuration.  Block
devices are arguably even more complex.  A difference: we can have many
block devices, but just one migration.

Here's the usual way to configure things: commands creating a thing take
the thing's configuration as arguments, other commands query and
manipulate a thing's configuration.  Works fine both for simple and
complex configuration.  Block devices work this way.

Migration doesn't.  Instead, we have global configuration state, and
commands to query and manipulate it.  Also works.

Instead of passing the entire configuration to the "create" command, you
can pass it piecemeal to "manipulate global configuration" commands.
You pay for the convenience by having to reset the entire global
configuration to a known state in certain situations.  Since use of the
global configuration state is implicit, it can be surprising, as Daniel
pointed out for savevm.

Overall, this isn't simpler or more convenient than the usual way, just
different.

Both ways use QAPI objects to hold configuration.  Query commands can
return such an object.  Commands that deal with partial configuration
can only take the same object when its members are optional.

In places where configuration is complete (internal configuration state,
the query command that returns it), optional makes no sense, and is
annoying.  We either accept that, or duplicate the configuration object.
Duplicating violates DRY.  It does result in better command
documentation, though.

On to 2.

Migration is not the only kind of long-running job.  There's also
block-commit, block-stream, drive-mirror, drive-backup, blockdev-create,
x-blockdev-amend, snapshot-load, snapshot-save, snapshot-delete.

These all create a "job" object that represents the long-running job.
We have commands and events to control and monitor such jobs: job-pause,
job-resume, job-cancel, job-complete, job-dismiss, job-finalize,
query-jobs, JOB_STATUS_CHANGE.

Migration does its own thing instead.

Yes, it's ugly, and the alternative is differently ugly, as discussed
above.

Based on experience in the block layer, I predict you'd regret this :)

Use of native C data types is just so much easier on the eyes than
messing with QObjects.  Moreover, the compiler can't help you as much
with QObjects.
