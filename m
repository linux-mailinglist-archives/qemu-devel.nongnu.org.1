From: "Maciej S. Szmigiero" <maciej.szmigiero@oracle.com>

This is an updated v6 patch series of the v5 series located here:
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/cover.1739994627.git.maciej.szmigiero@oracle.com/

What this patch set is about?
Current live migration device state transfer is done via the main (single)
migration channel, which reduces performance and severally impacts the
migration downtime for VMs having large device state that needs to be
transferred during the switchover phase.

Example devices that have such large switchover phase device state are some
types of VFIO SmartNICs and GPUs.

This patch set allows parallelizing this transfer by using multifd channels
for it.
It also introduces new load and save threads per VFIO device for decoupling
these operations from the main migration thread.
These threads run on newly introduced generic (non-AIO) thread pools,
instantiated by the core migration core.

Changes from v5:
* Add bql_locked() assertion to migration_incoming_state_destroy() with a
comment describing why holding BQL there is necessary.

* Add SPDX-License-Identifier to newly added files.

* Move consistency of multfd transfer settings check to the patch adding
x-migration-multifd-transfer property.

* Change packet->idx == UINT32_MAX message to the suggested one.

* Use WITH_QEMU_LOCK_GUARD() in vfio_load_state_buffer().

* Add vfio_load_bufs_thread_{start,end} trace events.

* Invert "ret" value computation logic in vfio_load_bufs_thread() and
  vfio_multifd_save_complete_precopy_thread() - initialize "ret" to false
  at definition, remove "ret = false" at every failure/early exit block and
  add "ret = true" just before the early exit jump label.

* Make vfio_load_bufs_thread_load_config() return a bool and take an
  "Error **" parameter.

* Make vfio_multifd_setup() (previously called vfio_multifd_transfer_setup())
  allocate struct VFIOMultifd if requested by "alloc_multifd" parameter.

* Add vfio_multifd_cleanup() call to vfio_save_cleanup() (for consistency
  with the load code), with a comment describing that it is currently a NOP
  there.

* Move vfio_multifd_cleanup() to migration-multifd.c.

* Move general multifd migration description in docs/devel/migration/vfio.rst
  from the top section to new "Multifd" section at the bottom.

* Add comment describing why x-migration-multifd-transfer needs to be
  a custom property above the variable containing that custom property type
  in register_vfio_pci_dev_type().

* Add object_class_property_set_description() description for all 3 newly
  added parameters: x-migration-multifd-transfer,
  x-migration-load-config-after-iter and x-migration-max-queued-buffers.

* Split out wiring vfio_multifd_setup() and vfio_multifd_cleanup() into
  general VFIO load/save setup and cleanup methods into a brand new
  patch/commit.

* Squash the patch introducing VFIOStateBuffer(s) into the "received buffers
  queuing" commit to fix building the interim code form at the time of this
  patch with "-Werror".
  
* Change device state packet "idstr" field to NULL-terminated and drop
  QEMU_NONSTRING marking from its definition.

* Add vbasedev->name to VFIO error messages to know which device caused
  that error.

* Move BQL lock ordering assert closer to the other lock in the lock order
  in vfio_load_state_buffer().

* Drop orphan "QemuThread load_bufs_thread" VFIOMultifd member leftover
  from the days of the version 2 of this patch set.

* Change "guint" into an "unsigned int" where it was present in this
  patch set.

* Use g_autoptr() for QEMUFile also in vfio_load_bufs_thread_load_config().

* Call multifd_abort_device_state_save_threads() if a migration error is
  already set in the save path to avoid needlessly waiting for the remaining
  threads to do all of their normal work.

* Other minor changes that should not have functional impact, like:
  renamed functions/labels, moved code lines between patches contained
  in this patch set, added review tags, code formatting, rebased on top
  of the latest QEMU git master, etc.

========================================================================
