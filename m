That's a good summary, but it should differentiate testing/runtime 
issues from building issues.

In general, maintainers should ensure code build on all 
platforms/configs. Of course, it's a best effort considering not all of 
them are built in CI, but in case a build issue is caught on time, it 
should be fixed before hitting master.

It may be worth to mention that all platforms can be accessed for free 
using: https://github.com/second-reality/github-runners.
If you're open to it, we could move this project under 
https://github.com/qemu and preinstall all dependencies on each runner, 
so people can easily jump on a shell and start debugging things without 
wasting time.

With this at hand, there is no reason to let a build failure be merged.

Thanks,
Pierrick
