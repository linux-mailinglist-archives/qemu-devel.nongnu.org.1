I think removing __NR_userfaultfd is still correct. The problem is that
the ufd_version_check code is wrapped in a conditional that is not the
same as the conditional that pulls in ioctl.h. That pre-existing bug
should be fixed regardless, and once that's done, removing __NR_userfaultfd
wouldn't be an issue.

Daniel
