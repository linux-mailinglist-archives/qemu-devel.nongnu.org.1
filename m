+ * This structure provides a vDSO-style clock to VM guests, exposing the
+ * relationship (or lack thereof) between the CPU clock (TSC, timebase, arch
+ * counter, etc.) and real time. It is designed to address the problem of
+ * live migration, which other clock enlightenments do not.
+ *
+ * When a guest is live migrated, this affects the clock in two ways.
+ *
+ * First, even between identical hosts the actual frequency of the underlying
+ * counter will change within the tolerances of its specification (typically
+ * ±50PPM, or 4 seconds a day). This frequency also varies over time on the
+ * same host, but can be tracked by NTP as it generally varies slowly. With
+ * live migration there is a step change in the frequency, with no warning.
+ *
+ * Second, there may be a step change in the value of the counter itself, as
+ * its accuracy is limited by the precision of the NTP synchronization on the
+ * source and destination hosts.
+ *
+ * So any calibration (NTP, PTP, etc.) which the guest has done on the source
+ * host before migration is invalid, and needs to be redone on the new host.
+ *
+ * In its most basic mode, this structure provides only an indication to the
+ * guest that live migration has occurred. This allows the guest to know that
+ * its clock is invalid and take remedial action. For applications that need
+ * reliable accurate timestamps (e.g. distributed databases), the structure
+ * can be mapped all the way to userspace. This allows the application to see
+ * directly for itself that the clock is disrupted and take appropriate
+ * action, even when using a vDSO-style method to get the time instead of a
+ * system call.
+ *
+ * In its more advanced mode. this structure can also be used to expose the
+ * precise relationship of the CPU counter to real time, as calibrated by the
+ * host. This means that userspace applications can have accurate time
+ * immediately after live migration, rather than having to pause operations
+ * and wait for NTP to recover. This mode does, of course, rely on the
+ * counter being reliable and consistent across CPUs.
+ *
+ * Note that this must be true UTC, never with smeared leap seconds. If a
+ * guest wishes to construct a smeared clock, it can do so. Presenting a
+ * smeared clock through this interface would be problematic because it
+ * actually messes with the apparent counter *period*. A linear smearing
+ * of 1 ms per second would effectively tweak the counter period by 1000PPM
+ * at the start/end of the smearing period, while a sinusoidal smear would
+ * basically be impossible to represent.
+ *
+ * This structure is offered with the intent that it be adopted into the
+ * nascent virtio-rtc standard, as a virtio-rtc that does not address the live
+ * migration problem seems a little less than fit for purpose. For that
+ * reason, certain fields use precisely the same numeric definitions as in
+ * the virtio-rtc proposal. The structure can also be exposed through an ACPI
+ * device with the CID "VMCLOCK", modelled on the "VMGENID" device except for
+ * the fact that it uses a real _CRS to convey the address of the structure
+ * (which should be a full page, to allow for mapping directly to userspace).
