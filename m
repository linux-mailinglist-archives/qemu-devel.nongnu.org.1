The above wasn't about heterogenous emulation but about single binary. 
That still needs a way to select the machine to emulate.

So it would have impact on existing CLI as it needs introducing at least 
one new option. Please note QEMU options are single dash so this could be 
-target or -T for short then one could do qemu-system -T arm -M raspi. 
This is another possible CLI for this. For machines that only exist in one 
arch the target option may not be needed.

This might not work if people want to rename the symlinked name although 
checking only the prefix could solve that.

We haven't discussed heterogenous emulation yet and what exact command 
line syntax to use can wait but discussing what command line option is 
needed and how to represent it might influence how the internal 
implementation will be or how easy it will be to implement such command 
line so it's good to consider that now as it may influence the design. 
You'll need to store target somewhere so the command line can list it or 
select it so deciding if it should be an Object property or Machine or 
Device property might also have impact on the possible command line syntax 
and vice versa so maybe it's not something you can totally ignore.

This isn't something that was discussed above and I agree it's not 
something to discuss yet.
