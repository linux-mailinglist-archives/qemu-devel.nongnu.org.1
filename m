Alright, having a deeper look I'm actually using NUMA for 2 info:

- How many cpu per Package: this helps me calculate the ratio.

- To whom package the cpu belongs: to calculate the ratio with the right=20
  package energy counter.

Without libnuma, I'm bit confused on how to handle this.=20

Should I parse /sys/bus/node/devices/node* to know how many packages ?
Should I parse /sys/bus/node/devices/node0/cpu0/topology/core_cpus_list=20
to handle which cpu belongs to which package ?

Would that be too cumbusome for the user to enter the detail about how
many packages and how many cpu per pakages ?=20

i.e:=20
-kvm,rapl=3Dtrue,maxpkgs=3D2,cpupkgs=3D8,rapl-helper-socket=3D/path/sock.so=
ck

Very informative, thanks !
