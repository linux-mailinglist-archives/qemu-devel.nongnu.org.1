I understand this is fundamental, i.e. CPR state is *required* to create
backends.  Correct?

>    (because the chardevs that define a monitor are backends).

This is an artifact of the way we configure monitors (use of a character
backend) and create character backends (all at once at a certain point
in startup).

Some management applications would prefer to use the command line just
for setting up QMP, and do everything else in QMP.  Understandable!
They need to use QMP anyway, and mostly eliminating the command line
would simplify things.  Moreover, only QMP provides introspection.

To enable this, we need to provide a way to start a QMP monitor early
enough to set up everything else.  If we pull this off, "monitor must be
created after backends are created" is no longer true.

Aside: in my view, QMP and command line are transports wrapping around
an abstract interface.  I'd like to have them wrap around the *same*
abstract interface.

Fundamental.

I'm not objecting to your doc text.  I asked to better understand your
thinking, because I needed that for a competent review.

Certainly not a blocker.  If we decide it's an improvement we want, we
can easily do it on top.

I routinely point out lots of little things that aren't blockers.  I try
to be clear what is a blocker and what isn't, but I'm far from perfect
there.  Thanks for your patience!
