Personally when I'm accumulating patches as a maintainer I do
fix up this kind of commit message. It's generally from a first
time contributor, so the commit needs closer attention anyway,
and I favour just fixing "this isn't quite the way we usually
do things" problems at my end, rather than asking the submitter to
resend. I also fix nits from longer term contributors where it's
faster to do that than to ask for a respin.

In this specific case I'd probably re-cast the commit message
entirely, because the first-person past-tense phrasing is not
our standard commit log style. I would also want to add something
clarifying exactly what we're fixing (clearly "the Windows build"
generally was not broken, or we'd have seen it in CI, so this
is fixing a more niche build environment setup, and it's worth
having the commit message be clear about what that setup is).

Fixing up a pullreq is also basically not possible -- the
pullreq is signed and you can't change the commits in it.
I don't recommend throwing random fixes (as opposed to
genuine simple merge conflict fixes) into the merge commit.
