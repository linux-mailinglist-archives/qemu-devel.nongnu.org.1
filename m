Cross-references alone will be a *massive* improvement!  I'm sure
readers will appreciate better looks and an index, too.

I'm a Sphinx noob.  Let me paraphrase you to make sure I understand.

You proprose to generate formatted documentation in two steps:

=E2=80=A2 First, the QAPI generator generates .rst from the QAPI schema.  T=
he
  generated .rst makes use of a custom directives.

=E2=80=A2 Second, Sphinx turns the .rst into formatted documentation.  A Sp=
hinx
  qapi-domain extension implements the custom directives

This mirrors how Sphinx works for Python docs.  Which is its original
use case.

Your series demonstrates the second step, with test input you wrote
manually.

You have code for the first step, but you'd prefer to show it later.

Fair?

I'd appreciate help with that.  Opinions?

Let me elaborate a bit here.

A command's arguments can be specified inline, like so:

    { 'command': 'job-cancel', 'data': { 'id': 'str' } }

The arguments are then documented right with the command.

But they can also be specified by referencing an object type, like so:

    { 'command': 'block-dirty-bitmap-remove',
      'data': 'BlockDirtyBitmap' }

Reasons for doing it this way:

=E2=80=A2 Several commands take the same arguments, and you don't want to r=
epeat
  yourself.

=E2=80=A2 You want generated C take a single struct argument ('boxed': true=
).

=E2=80=A2 The arguments are a union (which requires 'boxed': true).

Drawback: the arguments are then documented elsewhere.  Not nice.

Bug: the generated documentation fails to point there.

You're proposing to inline the argument documentation, so it appears
right with the command.

An event's data is just like a command's argument.

A command's return value can only specified by referencing a type.  Same
doc usability issue.

Similarly, a union type's base can specified inline or by referencing a
struct type, and a union's branches must be specified by referencing a
struct type.  Same doc usability issue.

At least, the generated documentation does point to the referenced
types.

qemu-storage-daemon's QMP is a proper subset of qemu-system-FOO's.
Regardless, each of them has its own, independent reference manual.
That's defensible.

But the way we build them can complicate matters.  For instance, when I
tried to elide types not used for QMP from the reference manuals, I got
defeated by Sphinx caching.

Yes, this is a real problem.

The member documentation gets written in the context of the type.  It
may make sense only in that context.  Inlining copies it into a
different context.

Features may need to combine.  Say a command's arguments are a union
type, and several branches of the union both contain deprecated members.
These branch types all document feature @deprecated.  Simply inlining
their feature documentation results in feature @deprecated documented
several times.  Ugh.  Combining them would be better.  But how?  Do we
need to rethink how we document features?

Looks promising!
