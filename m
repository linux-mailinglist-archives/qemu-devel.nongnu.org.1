Shame you missed the 6 iterations of that patch that last for a year.=20
I would have changed that directly !
Anyway I take note on that comment and will send a modification.

There a patch in WIP that change this into a Tracepoint. Maybe you can=20
SSH to the VM in meanwhile ?

This could happen only when a vCPU thread ID has changed between the=20
call of a rdmsr throught the socket and the hepler that read the msr.
No idea how a vCPU can change TID or shutdown that fast.

Right taking a note on that as well.

I will try to see how to improve that part.=20
Thanks for your valuable feedback.

Yes but the address are completely different. However, this in my ToDo=20
list. First I need way more feedback like yours to move on extending=20
this feature.

It's taken into account during the ratio calculation which socket the=20
vCPU has just been scheduled. But yes the value are more 'accurate' when=20
the vCPU is pinned.

This feature is revolving around a thread. Please look at the=20
documentation is not already done:

https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/specs/rapl-msr.html#high-level-implementat=
ion

If we only fetch from vCPU thread, we won't have the consumption of the=20
non-vcpu thread. They are taken into account in the total.



Thanks again for your feedback.=20

Anthony
