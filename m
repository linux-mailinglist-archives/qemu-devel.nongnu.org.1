Indeed, QEMU sometimes models non-existing machines (e.g. the mac99 or virt boards) that don't correspond to real hardware but allow guest OSes to boot. Even when modelllng real hardware it's ofren modelled just enough for guests to work and unused details are omitted for simplicity. It is recommended to follow what real hardware does when modelling real hardware but not always required. Although it might help both with verifying a device model and to compose machines with these models to try to follow the real hardware.

Even without pure virt machines currently a lot of QEMU machines don't 
exactly model real hardware. They may roughly follow real hardware but not 
exactly such as mac99 is a non-existent Mac and the pc machines also use 
some parts that don't exist in real life such as PIIX4-PIIX3 hybrid you've 
been working on resolving. Some of these however are restricted by 
backward compatibilty requirements. But you probably aware of all of that 
but this means the argument that real hardware should be followed is not 
enough. At least it should not break backward compatibility too much and 
that's more important than exactly modelling real machine. Also having a 
simple model may be more important than modeling every detail even when 
not used just to follow real hardware.

>>> port 92 belongs into any device model where the hardware has one. All our PC-like southbridges (PIIX, ICH, VIA) have port 92. Many FDC37xxxx including the FDC37M81x as used in the Malta board have one, too -- where it must first be enabled.

Real chips probably implement this in different ways so we could either model this in these chips independently the same way as real hardware does or use the abstracted model anywhere in our machine model. Since this does not exist in real hardware as this abstract model it also does not belong anywhere so we are free to put it where it's most convenient or simple to do.

Mark argued that more specifically it's part of the superio within those 
couthbridges. That makes sense, considering this port92 is related to 
functionality that was in the keyboard contorller before which is part of 
the superio. I don't know PC hardware too well but reading about this fast 
gate A20 feature looks like original PC and XT had only a 1 MB address 
space but addresses above 1 MB wrapped to 0 and some software depended on 
that. Then AT added more memory but then it needed a way to control if 
addresses above 1 MB would wrap or access high memory. This was done with 
some free part of the keyboard controller but that was too slow so an 
alternative fast way was added with this port92 device. But then the old 
keyboard controller and this port92 stuff are interacting so may need to 
consider both. Apart from that all of this is not relevant to other 
machines that don't use this functionality.

QEMU decided to model it as a separate QOM object that is now instantiated 
by the machines that use it. This is not real hardware but a QEMU 
implementation detail. What's wrong with that? It seems you just want to 
simplify the pc machine creation and push this object that does not 
correspond to some real hardware somewhere else. But this belongs nowhere 
as it does not model a real hardware.

Then I think the port92 as a QOM object should be gone completely and 
implemented separately in south bridges beacause in real machine there's 
no such port 92 thing, only a south briege so if you need to create port92 
in a data driver machine description then that's not modeling real 
hardware but reflects QEMU implementation of it. However the QOM object 
could be retained as an internal object whithn the device model if that 
makes it model simpler or helps code reuse. I'm not convinced about that 
but I also don't care enough to mind if it will still be there somewhere 
outside of the VIA model. What I care about is that I don't want 
unneccesary things in the VIA model and want to keep it simple.

I think you got feedback. My proposal was to remove port92 object and 
implemnt it in the south bridges instead independently but you did not 
like that because wanted to keep it at a central place and maybe also 
migration compatibility is simpler if it's kept (although I think that can 
be solved by some compatibility function in the machine the same way as 
optional sections or changes in migration format are handled on the 
receving side where it could set a property on some object exporting the 
state of this register).

Then Mark proposed to move it down into superio which is used by all these 
southbridges and it also contains the keyboard controller which this 
might interact with so that seems like a good place to put it (either 
instantiating the port92 object there or implementing it directly). As 
long as this keeps it out from VIA and does not need too much QOM wizardry 
in the VIA model (more than maybe forwarding a property for this), I'm 
happy with that so I think you could try that unless you see some problem 
with this approach.

Now if you also want to change the keyboard controller too, maybe port92 
handling could also be implemented there instead of the superio as an 
optional part that machines that need it can enable. But all this will 
probably result in that either the pc machine will need to dig down to 
find this part or have a chain of property forwarding through superio and 
south bridge models that would complicate those models which may be uglier 
than what we have now to just instantiate the port92 object in the pc 
machine and leave the other models that don't need it without this 
complication.
