Thanks for taking the time to assemble all this in a comprehensible 
post, I'll give it a try when I have some spare time.

I understand the difference. It can be tricky to generate specific 
translation scenarios, which is where a custom test device can really help.

Does it rely on a custom driver integration into an existing firmware or 
the kernel?

This is very welcome. Once this is in place, it would be great to add a 
new test to make sure things don't regress, and from where we can iterate.
By self-contained within QEMU, do you mean a QTest based test?
