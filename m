Hi Michael / All,

This is a bit late in the cycle due to some travel and alignment with the
end of a kernel cycle which has made me very busy. If needed I'll send a
rebased version of these right at the start of the 10.1 cycle.

As in previous cycles I have been gathering up reviewed patches so as to
resolve merge conflicts etc before proposing a set to merge to Michael
Tsirkin (and for additional review). The focus of the CXL support continues
to be on emulating a subset of features useful to Linux kernel testing +
more limited support for out of band management over mctp
(one patch in here)

Note that I've only picked up the first of Arpit's series for log
manipulation as the clear and populate log functions are only useful if
any of the supported logs actually allow those functions otherwise they
will always return an error (which will occur for all logs we currently
emulate) The capabilities query is applicable for the Command Effects Log
and indeed indicates that we can't clear or populate it. So that is fine
on it's own.

Otherwise this is a mixed bag of features. The media operations are
particularly interesting as they enable offloading of memory zeroing
/ wiping.  Support for aborting background operations is needed to
enable testing of a feature that allows us to enable userspace access
to background commands without risking lockout of urgent kernel commands

Thanks,

Jonathan
