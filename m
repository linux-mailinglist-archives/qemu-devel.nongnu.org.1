This isn't promising that QEMU is free of security bugs - that is
impossible to claim for anything. It is telling the user that this
is a set of features that have been written with a credible attempt
to provide a security boundary, and thus they can rely on them to
confine untrusted workloads.

I think it is good to treat each piece of information as independent.
ie something can be considered secure, while at the same time also
be deprecated. Or something can be considered suitable for production
usage, while also being insecure. e.g. TCG can be used in production,
but you shouldn't used it with untrusted guests. I'm not sure that
a notion of "production" really makes sense at all, as that is
somewhat dependent on use case and the user's POV.

I'd see three pieces of useful info - deprecation status (bool),
security status (bool),  maintainer status (enum), and each can be
tackled independently, not least to make the work more practical. 

With regards,
Daniel
