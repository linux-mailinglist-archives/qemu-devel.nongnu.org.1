after commit 047dabef97 ("block/io_uring: use aio_add_sqe()") using
'aio=io_uring' for an 'ide-hd' drive becomes prohibitively slow: for me,
a Debian 12 guest [0] won't even reach the GRUB menu after multiple
minutes. Using aio=threads makes the issue go away, as does building
from the previous commit, i.e. 1eebdab3c3 ("aio-posix: add aio_add_sqe()
API for user-defined io_uring requests"). The issue still exists on
current master.

There are lots and lots of 512 byte read requests. MAX_BUFFERED_REQS in
ide_buffered_readv() is only 16, maybe that has something to do with it?
Haven't had the time to dig into the issue yet, and wasn't able to
reproduce with 'qemu-img bench' or something other than 'ide-hd'.

Best Regards,
Fiona
