Well, the thing is, KVM's patching is done with the effective
permissions of the guest which means, if the code in question isn't
writable from the guest's point of view, KVM's attempt to modify it will
fail. This failure isn't transparent for the guest as it sees a #PF
instead of a #UD, and that's what I'm trying to fix by disabling the quirk.

The hypercall patching was introduced in Linux commit 7aa81cc04781
("KVM: Refactor hypercall infrastructure (v3)") in v2.6.25. Until then
it was based on a dedicated hypercall page that was handled by KVM to
use the proper instruction of the KVM module in use (VMX or SVM).

Patching code was fine back then, but the introduction of DEBUG_RO_DATA
made the patching attempts fail and, ultimately, lead to Paolo handle
this with commit c1118b3602c2 ("x86: kvm: use alternatives for VMCALL
vs. VMMCALL if kernel text is read-only").

However, his change still doesn't account for the cross-vendor live
migration case (Intel<->AMD), which will still be broken, causing the
before mentioned bogus #PF, which will just lead to misleading Oops
reports, confusing the poor souls, trying to make sense of it.

IMHO, there is no valid reason for still having the patching in place as
the .text of non-ancient kernel's  will be write-protected, making
patching attempts fail. And, as they fail with a #PF instead of #UD, the
guest cannot even handle them appropriately, as there was no memory
write attempt from its point of view. Therefore the default should be to
disable it, IMO. This won't prevent guests making use of the wrong
instruction from trapping, but, at least, now they'll get the correct
exception vector and can handle it appropriately.

KVM_CAP_DISABLE_QUIRKS2 fixes that bug of KVM_CAP_DISABLE_QUIRKS by
doing just that: returning the mask of supported quirks when queried via
KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION. So if KVM_X86_QUIRK_FIX_HYPERCALL_INSN is in that
mask, it can also be disabled. If that attempt fails (for whatever
reason), it's an error, which makes kvm_vm_enable_cap() return a
non-zero value, triggering the warn_report("kvm: failed to disable
hypercall patching quirk") in the caller.

If KVM_X86_QUIRK_FIX_HYPERCALL_INSN is missing in the
KVM_CAP_DISABLE_QUIRKS2 mask, it may either be that KVM is too old to
even have the hypercall patching (pre-v2.6.25) or does do the patching,
just doesn't have KVM_X86_QUIRK_FIX_HYPERCALL_INSN yet, which came in
Linux commit f1a9761fbb00 ("KVM: x86: Allow userspace to opt out of
hypercall patching"), which is v5.19.

Ignoring pre-v2.6.25 kernels for a moment, we can assume that KVM will
do the patching. So the lack of KVM_X86_QUIRK_FIX_HYPERCALL_INSN but
having 'hypercall_patching_enabled == false' indicates that the user
wants to disable it but QEMU cannot do so, because KVM lacks the
extension to do so. This, IMO, legitimizes the warn_report("kvm:
disabling hypercall patching not supported") -- as it's not supported.

No, returning 0 here is very much on purpose, as you noticed, to avoid
the warn_report() in the caller. The already issued warn_report() is the
correct one for this case.

I guess, it's a question of if disabling hypercall patching is a hard
requirement or can soft-fail. I decided for the latter, as hypercall
patching shouldn't be needed in most cases, so if it cannot be disabled,
it's mostly fine to start the VM still.
