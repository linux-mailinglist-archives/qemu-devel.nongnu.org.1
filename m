Did we document anything about most QOM properties anywhere?

But yes, I think your understanding is right. Before Stefan's patch,
when it was interpreted as string "1", it resulted in "addr = 01.0" in
info qtree, now that it's interpreted as integer, we get "addr = 00.1".
And adding merely a function without the device it is part of, it makes
sense that the guest doesn't see it.

It's not completely clear to me what this commit actually intended.

But before it, .set was integer-only, it was only .parse that accepted
strings (and only strings). I'm not familiar enough with qdev history to
tell which was used for which case. I suppose .set was mostly for
internal users and .parse for external interfaces (command line, HMP,
maybe also QMP?)

So if that is right, it added strings to internal users, and integers to
external users. Not sure which part was actually needed and for what
reason.

Right. qdev and QAPI still live in two separate worlds. This was never
modelled as a QAPI type/command, device_add doesn't have a schema.

Before the patch in this pull request, you couldn't even have non-scalar
properties, so it wouldn't even have been possible to split it like
that. Unless you make it two totally separate properties, but then you
could set one without the other, which feels like it would only add more
strange cases.

Not sure if it's worth it. But at least it's possible to add the
preferred syntax, by adding a dict branch to the alternate.

I don't expect many users of our external interfaces to use the integer
syntax, so removing it shouldn't hurt from that point of view.

Internal users in the C code still use the integer version. We would
have to change that first. In a quick grep, I see 14 callers, so that
seems doable.

I also see that the property getter is still always integer. So if you
query the device, that's what you get even in external interfaces. Not
sure if anyone relies on that, though. Probably not.

If you ask me, 3. is the only correctly modelled interface. Addresses
are set as a single unit, and they are not just a list of same things,
but the two values have different meanings.
