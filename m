Thanks for looking into this! I am now also affected by this bug and
highly motivated to resolve it. :)

I recently updated my Gentoo Linux system which included an update of
qemu from 9.0.2 to 9.2.0. After that I began to experience the issue
reported by Hank with a Windows 10 VM in libvirt using QXL graphics with
SPICE in virt-viewer. The Windows is fully updated and I've tried
installing the most recent guest drivers to no avail
(virtio-win-0.1.266.iso).

I've reconfirmed the issue with a freshly installed Windows 11, fully
updated and the same driver ISO.

Downgrading to 9.0.4 makes it go away. Downgrading to 9.1.2 does not.
Reverting above commit off of 9.2.0 as a custom patch to the Gentoo
package makes it go away as well.

At this point I grabbed the git repo and started another bisect between
9.0.0 and 9.1.0. During that I found a good "reproducer" to be to
frantically click on all the application icons on my desktop as fast as
possible (Firefox, Edge, LibreOffice, Chrome and PuTTY, FWIW). Apart
from a lot of CPU load, disk I/O and memory pressure it also causes
frequent cursor changes from pointer to spinning wheel to pointer with
spinning wheel. If nothing else, it helps pass the time to the freeze.
:)

With that I ended up at exactly the same commit as Hank found above.
Reverting that commit off of current devel HEAD makes the problem go
away as well. With vanilla devel HEAD the freezes persist/come back.

I can also confirm that the issue has to do with scaling of Windows UI
elements. At 100% the freezes to not appear (or at least not so I can
trigger them with my "reproducer"). At 150% or 200% scaling I can
trigger them quite quickly (< 30s).

Also, identically to Hank's findings, the VM continues to respond to
ICMP requests (ping) as well as agent requests from virsh (e.g.
guestinfo). A shutdown command however hangs/times out.

How would I do that? On the source level or is there an environment
variable/command line option?

I went to the commit before this one and the issue disappeared. Also the
positive effect of reverting it off of HEAD seems to suggest that if not
the main culprit it at least makes the possibly underlying issue
surface.

I've extracted the IFrame URL
https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/pages/css/cursor.html from
this and played with it for some time.

On an idling system the cursor changes do not seem to be enough to
trigger the issue. Once I start to put load on the system by starting
applications as per my "reproducer" I can no longer be sure if and how
cursor changes play into it because lots of windows start popping up.
All hangs I can remember have been showing the segmented spinning blue
wheel animated cursor though.

The stuck qemu still does things at about 3% CPU load.
I can attach to it with gdb and pull the thread list below.
Do any of those look interesting to you?

This is right after the display gets stuck. The workers die down over time.

This patch on top of current devel HEAD (as well as directly on top of
the commit in question) makes it worse: The freezes start happening
immediately after the desktop shell is started. I think I've even seen it
freeze when the boot logo and spinner were still showing, possibly when
the (also scaled) login screen tries to initialise.

I'm out of my depth further narrowing down the cause and standing by to
try whatever you tell me.

Thanks,
Michael
