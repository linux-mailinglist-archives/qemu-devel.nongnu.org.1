In general yes. Using new traits has two advantages (all IMHO of
course). First, it makes it possible to tie the implementation to the
availability of a freeing function; second, it makes it possible to
define this always, whereas From is limited by the orphan rule (you
cannot provide implementations of a trait for a struct unless you are
the crate that defines either the struct or the trait).

... for example, you can't have such a blanket implementation "impl<T,
U: From<T>> From<T> for Option<U> {}".

I am not 100% convinced of the ForeignBox name but I see your point.
You'd prefer to have "impl FreeForeign for c_char" and "impl
CloneToForeign for str", where it's the CloneToForeign::Foreign
associated type (in this case c_char) that must implement FreeForeign.
Also, clone_to_foreign() for a str would return an
OwnedPointer<c_char>, not an OwnedPointer<str>. Never be too
optimistic about Rust, but that should be doable and I agree it is
better.

Is that true? For example we could have qobject_unref, or qapi_free_*
as implementations of FreeForeign.

I think that's a bit too magical. Making Error always represent an
owned object seems a bit risky; instead I'm treating the bindings::XYZ
structs as very C-like objects, that are usually managed through
either OwnedPointer<...> (e.g. for a parameter) or *mut XYZ (for a
return value).

Thanks for looking at this. This kind of review is something that
we'll have to do a lot and it's better to have some early experience
of what they look like, independent of whether this code ultimately
will or will not be part of QEMU.
