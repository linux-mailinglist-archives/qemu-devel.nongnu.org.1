Yeah, that's exactly what I was concerned about.
Thanks for clearing that up!

perfmon_version is a great idea --- I might add it as a property to the QEMU 
vCPU template in the future, so it can adjust based on user input and host support.
Can't promise a timeline yet, but it's definitely something I'll keep in mind.
