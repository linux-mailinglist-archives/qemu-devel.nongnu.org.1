Agreed. For CXL memory (which indeed hits this with virtio-blk-pci for exam=
ple)
I'm carrying a far from subtle patch [1] on top of the series linked above
(which I would very much like to land asap!)  Note I also need:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20240215142817.1904-1-Jonathan.Cameron@h=
uawei.com/#t
[PATCH 0/3] physmem: Fix MemoryRegion for second access to cached MMIO Addr=
ess Space

otherwise the second 8 byte read comes from the wrong address space.
That used to accidentally trigger very large reads hence the rather excessi=
ve
size set below.  I haven't checked yet if a smaller size is fine as obvious=
ly
something as hacky as the below isn't going anywhere! Perhaps we need a rat=
her more
global version of x-max-bounce-buffers from Mattias' series?
