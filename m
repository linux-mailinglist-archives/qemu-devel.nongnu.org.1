Yeah don't use -hdX as they are legacy options with a lot of default
assumptions. As the docs say: https://qemu.readthedocs.io/en/master/system/=
invocation.html#hxtool-1

  The QEMU block device handling options have a long history and have
  gone through several iterations as the feature set and complexity of
  the block layer have grown. Many online guides to QEMU often reference
  older and deprecated options, which can lead to confusion.

  The most explicit way to describe disks is to use a combination of
  -device to specify the hardware device and -blockdev to describe the
  backend. The device defines what the guest sees and the backend
  describes how QEMU handles the data. It is the only guaranteed stable
  interface for describing block devices and as such is recommended for
  management tools and scripting.

  The -drive option combines the device and backend into a single
  command line option which is a more human friendly. There is however
  no interface stability guarantee although some older board models
  still need updating to work with the modern blockdev forms.

  Older options like -hda are essentially macros which expand into -drive
  options for various drive interfaces. The original forms bake in a lot
  of assumptions from the days when QEMU was emulating a legacy PC, they
  are not recommended for modern configurations.
