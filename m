I was setting up a windows guest on the linux box in my university lab
since some software used in the university only supports Windows :(.
As the linux box only runs background services like nfs share, and I
only ssh to it for coding. I'd like to passthrough the GPU to guset so
it can have baremetal-like GUI experience. During setup, I found there
were limitations and conflicting tutorials, which makes me curious
about how it actually works.

Currently legacy mode requires creating a dummy LPC bridge at 00:1f.0,
but on q35, there is already an ICH9 LPC there. In my trials, LPC is
not a must for linux guests and windows guests with recent driver.
Only UEFI GOP requires it. Making it as another x-igd- option will
give more flexibility I believe.

"Legacy" mode implicitly means enabling the options below I think
* x-igd-opregion=on
* dummy lpc bridge, as well as host bridge ids
* x-vga=on, not a must, but code tries to enable VGA access

Remoing legacy mode while keeping the current behavior is challenging,
as legacy mode is implicitly enabled by addr=0x2 and doesn't fail if
any condition is not met. It seems we cannot replace legacy mode in
a completely clean mannar, my proposal for the default values are:

| config          | x-igd-opregion | lpc quirk |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------|
| i440fx,addr=0x2 | yes            | yes       |
| i440fx,others   | no             | no        |
| q35             | no             | no        |

However, it doesn't handle the cases legacy mode fails halfway :(,
any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Sure. I will include it in the documentation update.
