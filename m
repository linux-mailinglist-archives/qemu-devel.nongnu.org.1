The thing about nonsense user rquests / unavailable resources , etc
is that almost none of them should imply exiting QEMU, except if they
occur in the context of system startup before the VM starts executing.
Once running we should do everything in our power to not let the users
workload die.

From that POV, I tend to wish that error_fatal did not exist and that
we instead propagated all fatal errors up until reaching main(), so
we were not at risk of using error_fatal in runtime scenarios. We're
largely stuck with what we've got though, due to our need to retrofit
error reporting in to our existing codebase design.

I do try to push back in review any time we introduce new code that
doesn't propagate errors as high up the stack as possible/practcal.

We could have called it &error_assert but that's bike shed colouring :-)

I don't see 'warnings' as something directly actionable for a user.
Rather they are messages that I would want to see included in a log
file that a user attaches to a bug report if they find some behavioural
problem. If the user understands the warning great, but that isn't a
requirement.

IOW, while informative warnings is of course better than not, as long
as the warning message contains sufficient info for the maintainer to
understand what happened the minimum quality bar is satisfied IMHO.

With regards,
Daniel
