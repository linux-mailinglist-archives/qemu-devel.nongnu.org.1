In e1000e_write_packet_to_guest() we attempt to ensure that we don't
write more of a packet to a descriptor than will fit in the guest
configured receive buffers.  However, this code does not allow for
the "packet split" feature.  When packet splitting is enabled, the
first of up to 4 buffers in the descriptor is used for the packet
header only, with the payload going into buffers 2, 3 and 4.  Our
length check only checks against the total sizes of all 4 buffers,
which meant that if an incoming packet was large enough to fit in (1
+ 2 + 3 + 4) but not into (2 + 3 + 4) and packet splitting was
enabled, we would run into the assertion in
e1000e_write_hdr_frag_to_rx_buffers() that we had enough buffers for
the data:

qemu-system-i386: ../../hw/net/e1000e_core.c:1418: void e1000e_write_payload_frag_to_rx_buffers(E1000ECore *, hwaddr *, E1000EBAState *, const char *, dma_addr_t): Assertion `bastate->cur_idx < MAX_PS_BUFFERS' failed.

A malicious guest could provoke this assertion by configuring the
device into loopback mode, and then sending itself a suitably sized
packet into a suitably arrange rx descriptor.

The code also fails to deal with the possibility that the descriptor
buffers are sized such that the trailing checksum word does not fit
into the last descriptor which has actual data, which might also
trigger this assertion.

Rework the length handling to use two variables:
 * desc_size is the total amount of data DMA'd to the guest
   for the descriptor being processed in this iteration of the loop
 * rx_desc_buf_size is the total amount of space left in it

As we copy data to the guest (packet header, payload, checksum),
update these two variables.  (Previously we attempted to calculate
desc_size once at the top of the loop, but this is too difficult to
do correctly.) Then we can use the variables to ensure that we clamp
the amount of copied payload data to the remaining space in the
descriptor's buffers, even if we've used one of the buffers up in the
packet-split code, and we can tell whether we have enough space for
the full checksum word in this descriptor or whether we're going to
need to split that to the following descriptor.

I have included comments that hopefully help to make the loop
logic a little clearer.
