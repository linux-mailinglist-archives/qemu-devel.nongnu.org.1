Especially for sphinx.

mkvenv/pythondeps.toml has been very stable, perhaps beyond expectations,
so at least it was a one time cost.

I agree, and I should thank you for hearing me out on the somewhat crazy
idea that's mkvenv.

Willing, I am not sure. Able yes, which is what matters even if they're not
really willing. :)

And they probably care much less about docs to be honest.

That's basically an extension and clarification of what already exists at
https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/about/build-platforms.html ("Python
runtime").

Piggybacking on Python EOL as a necessary but not sufficient condition is
at the same time conservative and useful.

OpenSUSE is not a problem since their base Python is not even supported by
QEMU. CentOS Stream is the more sticky one, unless you have a good reason
to require 3.10 (personally I don't, other than nicer type annotations I
have no love for e.g. match expressions).

Yeah, their problem. Both Red Hat and SUSE have figured it out.

That's the cop out for Red Hat, where you accept 3.9 for building and
require 3.10 for docs and tests? Not sure about it, especially tests. I
would either restrict the limitation to docs, or just declare 3.10 the
minimum once 3.9 is EOL (say January 2026).

Yes, this is the real problem. And it's better to have a plan ahead of time.

(As an aside, Meson is the good guy here. It supports old versions of
Python just fine The only reason to push Meson versions past 1.2 was to
support Rust-adjacent features and bugfixes that especially after 1.5 we're
mostly written by yours truly, specifically to evolve Rust support in the
direction that QEMU is interested in).
