Any argv that we process are subject to clashing with that defined by
the test harness and it is desirable to avoid making assumptions about
what test harness args exist.

To avoid that they would all have to be long options named with a
fixed prefix --qemu-XXXX. Also that sould be something applied to
all env vars, not just the couple of params in this series.

Hmm, not sure that the 'discover' option makes sense when we're asking to
run a single test file.
