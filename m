So, we get into trouble when accept the distro versions for some, but
not all depenencies, and end up with a mix of "accepted" and "installed"
versions that doesn't play together.

Ways to avoid this scenario:

* Ensure the "installed" version play with all the "accepted" versions
  of everything else.  I.e. as we move "installed" up, "accepted" needs
  to move up as well.

* We keep "accepted" for everything low enough so that we don't fall
  back to "installed" on any distro we care about.  Feels brittle.

Any others?

One of the "tools" being John Snow, I'm afraid.  Making the full Sphinx
version range work was impressive (and expensive!) work.  I take a
rather dim view on this kind of expensive heroics.  If John gets run
over by a bus, our hand may well be forced: I can't maintain the result
of his heroism, that's for sure.
