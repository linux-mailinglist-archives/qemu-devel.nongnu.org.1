Hello Peter, Dan, Fabiano,

Thank you so much for the detailed comments, I appreciate it.

* Right, okay.

* So then IIUC, libvirtd(8) would invoke migration by sending (without
first checking with the destination libvirtd(8)) the migration command
to the source QEMU and in qmp_migrate() before setting up the required
connections, QEMU will add the feature negotiation (or handshake)
step, right?

* True. I've seen the mismatch/disconnect between QEMU features and
how libvirtd(8)/virsh(1) offers them to the end users. ex. What QEMU
calls Multifd, virsh(1) calls --parallel-connections. Features like
'postcopy-preempt-channel' are implemented in QEMU, but no way for an
end user to see/enable/disable it from virsh(1) side.

* TBH, Multifd is such a misnomer, it could have been a plain simple
--threads <N> option.
    ex: virsh migrate --threads <N>: precopy migration with <N>
threads, default <N> =3D 1.

   Irrespective of the number of threads, the underlying migration
mechanism/protocol remains the same. Threads only help to accelerate
the rate of data transfer through multiple connections. We don't have
to differentiate channels by sending magic values then.

* Since we are thinking about correcting past wrongs, does having a
unified migration protocol make sense? OR that is too ambitious a
thing to think about? (just checking)

* Meanwhile, @Fabiano Rosas If you have not started with the handshake
or feature negotiation in QEMU, I'd try it on my side and we can
discuss how the handshake should work. If you've already started with
it, I'd be happy to help in some way as possible.

* Are we thinking about dynamically adjusting migration features based
on their availability on both sides? Ex. say source says open 10
parallel connections, but destination can do only 5, then source
reports an error and terminates migration or continues with 5
threads/connections OR say user does not mention parallel connections,
but still we automatically start multiple threads because both ends
support it? Just checking about dynamic adjustments, because earlier
while discussing with Peter, he mentioned that we can not
enable/disable user supplied options.

Thank you.
