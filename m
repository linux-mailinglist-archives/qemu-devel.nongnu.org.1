The company 'Arm' went through a rebranding many years back
involving a recapitalization from 'ARM' to 'Arm'. As a result
our documentation is a bit inconsistent between the two forms.
It's not worth trying to update everywhere in QEMU, but it's
easy enough to make docs/ consistent.

We last did this in commit 6fe6d6c9a in 2020, but a few new
uses of the wrong capitalization have crept back in since.

As before, "ARMv8" and similar architecture names, and
older CPU names like "ARM926" still retain all-caps.

In a few places we make minor grammar fixups as we touch
the sentences we're fixing.

I have left the uses in xlnx-zynq.rst because I fixed those
in a different patchset that overhauled that file.
