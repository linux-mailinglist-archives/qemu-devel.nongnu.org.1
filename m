This series is a side effect of other work I started, to attempt to
make the QGA safe to use in confidential VMs by automatically
restricting the permitted commands. Since this cleanup stands on
its own, I'm sending it now.

The QGA codebase has a very complicated maze of #ifdefs to create
stubs for the various commands that cannot be implemented on certain
platforms. It then has further logic to dynamically disable the stub
commands at runtime, except this is not consistently applied, so
some commands remain enabled despite being merely stubs.

The resulting code is hard to follow, when trying to understand exactly
what commands are available under what circumstances, and when changing
impls it is easy to get the #ifdefs wrong, resulting in stubs getting
missed on platforms without a real impl. In some cases, we have multiple
stubs for the same command, due to the maze of #ifdefs.

The QAPI schema language has support for many years for expressing
conditions against commands when declaring them. This results in the
QAPI code generator omitting their implementation entirely at build
time. This has mutliple benefits

 * The unsupported commands are guaranteed to not exist at runtime
 * No stubs need ever be defined in the code
 * The generated QAPI reference manual documents the build conditions

This series is broadly split into three parts

 * Moving tonnes of Linux only commands out of commands-posix.c
   into commands-linux.c to remove many #ifdefs.
 * Adding 'if' conditions in the QAPI schema to reflect the
   build conditions, removing many more #ifdefs
 * Sanitizing the logic for disabling/enabling commands at
   runtime to guarantee consistency

Changed in v2:

 - Make FSFreeze error reporting distinguish inability to enable
   VSS from user config choice

 - Fully remove ga_command_init_blockedrpcs() methods. No more
   special case disabling of commands. Either they're disabled
   at build time, or disabled by user config, or by well defined
   rule ie not permitted during FS freeze.

 - Apply rules later in startup to avoid crash from NULL config
   pointer

 - Document changed error messages in commit messages

 - Add -c / --config command line parameter

 - Fix mistaken enabling of fsfreeze hooks on win32

 - Remove pointless 'blockrpcs_key' variable

 - Allow concurrent setting of allow and block lists for
   RPC commands
