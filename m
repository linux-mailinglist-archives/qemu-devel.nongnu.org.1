FYI, I was NOT suggesting that you maintain anything under scripts/.

Rather I'm saying that if we want to apply python code standards, we
should (ultimately) apply them to all python code in the tree, and
that *ALL* maintainers and contributors should comply.

Consider our C standards - we don't apply them selectively to a subset
of the tree - we expect all maintainers to comply. I'd like us to have
the same be true of Python.

The only real issue we have with python standards is bringing existing
code upto par, before we can enable the checks.

Currently we have no easy way for other maintainers to enable their
python code be checked, without moving their code under python/ which
is undesirable IMHO.

If we move the python coding standards to meson.build, such that apply
to all of the source tree, and then exclude everything except python/,
we make it easier for other maintainers to bring stuff upto par. All
need do at that point is remove the exclusion rule for files incrementally
as they fix them.


With regards,
Daniel
