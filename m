OK thank you for the confirmation. So following Igor's suggestion I
indeed kept the current default value (legacy PCIe hotplug) and I don't
use a machine option anymore. Instead I use the x86 trick, ie.

-global acpi-ged.acpi-pci-hotplug-with-bridge-support=on

I can easily update your tests with that option, don't bother
respinning. I should be able to send the v3 by beginning of next week.

Thanks!
