Let's keep the datasheet names. I had forgotten the reason initially
and from an HW POV it makes sense to keep them in sync. I will add
some more comments to the patch.

If you did any hacks or workarounds in the QEMU models, please keep them
separate from the other patches so that we can discuss.

Sure.
