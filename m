No, we must assume  that O_DIRECT requires alignment both of the userspace
memory buffers, and the file offset on disk:

[quote man(open)]
  O_DIRECT
       The O_DIRECT flag may impose alignment restrictions  on  the  length
       and  address  of user-space buffers and the file offset of I/Os.  In
       Linux alignment restrictions vary by filesystem and  kernel  version
       and  might  be absent entirely.  The handling of misaligned O_DIRECT
       I/Os also varies; they can either fail with EINVAL or fall  back  to
       buffered I/O.
[/quote]

Given QEMU's code base, it is only safe for us to use O_DIRECT with RAM
blocks where we have predictable in-memory alignment, and have defined
a good on-disk offset alignment too.


With regards,
Daniel
