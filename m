Yeah, I kinda didn't want to go there any time soon though, since this
is only the second codebase I've added the properties to so far. If
preventing adding new things to "riscv,isa" is something the maintainers
of the RISC-V QEMU support are down to do, I certainly would not object.

ngl, I have never used user-mode before. I'll fix that up. I'm not
really an indef in c files fan, but if that is par for the course then
it works for me :)

Yup! It just looks confusing with that proc file.
# cat /proc/device-tree/cpus/cpu@0/riscv,isa-extensions
imafdchzicbomzicbozzicntrzicsrzifenceizihintntlzihintpausezihpmzawrszfazcaz=
cdzbazbbzbczbssstcsvadu#=20
which then shows up in /proc/cpuinfo as
isa             : rv64imafdch_zicbom_zicboz_zicntr_zicsr_zifencei_zihintpau=
se_zihpm_zba_zbb_zbs_sstc

Dumping the dtb and running it backwards through dtc you can see the
property looks like:
riscv,isa-extensions =3D "i\0m\0a\0f\0d\0c\0h\0zicbom\0zicboz\0zicntr\0zics=
r\0zifencei\0zihintntl\0zihintpause\0zihpm\0zawrs\0zfa\0zca\0zcd\0zba\0zbb\=
0zbc\0zbs\0sstc\0svadu";

That's the same way that compatibles appear:
# cat /proc/device-tree/soc/clint@2000000/compatible=20
sifive,clint0riscv,clint0#

The null terminating chars being the "issue" in both cases.

Cheers,
Conor.
