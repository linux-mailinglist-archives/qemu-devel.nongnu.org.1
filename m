No, we need to be able to use scratch_file() to refer to
previously created resources. For example, when we extract
files from an archive, we want to then reference those, or
when we uncompress a file.

We have a tearDown function which purges everything under the
scratch dir location, so if a test is interrupted in a "normal"
way we should be safe on re-run. Only if python is hard-terminated
would the tearDown method fail to get run.

Perhaps we should proactively purge the scratch location in
the setUp method too, as a safety net against previous unclean
shutdown, as the intent of the 'scratch file' concept is that
the test should have a clean environment when it starts running.

My recommendation  / preferred coding style for func tests is to
always pass the set of sub-dir/file components to scratch_file(),
and never try to manually construct file paths using 'join'.

With regards,
Daniel
