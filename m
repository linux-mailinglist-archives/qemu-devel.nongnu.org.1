I always find that table really hard to understand. I'm not sure
what intent is wrt to "host mailbox" in that table.   I can't immediately think
why the FM API CCI  (thing that was switch cci in earlier specs) wouldn't support
this particular command.  You are supposed to be able to control anything via
that which is controllable for MCTP. Only exceptions should be the few
things to do with the MCTP interface itself.

Just to add to the confusion, the entry for Get Physical Port State in the
host mailbox column is "MSW = mandatory on MCTP-based CCIs for all switches that support
the FM API MCTP message type" which is odd given that mailbox isn't mctp based.

Gut feeling is that it can be implemented on the 'switch CCI'.  I'd like to do
that for now just because the MCTP stuff is going to take longer to upstream
and I'd rather your series was not queued up behind it.
