The migration QAPI design has always felt rather odd to me, in that we
have perfectly good commands "migrate" & "migrate-incoming" that are able
to accept an arbitrary list of parameters when invoked. Instead of passing
parameters to them though, we instead require apps use the separate
migreate-set-parameters/capabiltiies commands many times over to set
global variables which the later 'migrate' command then uses.

The reason for this is essentially a historical mistake - we copied the
way we did it from HMP, which was this way because HMP was bad at supporting
arbitrary customizable paramters to commands. I wish we hadn't copied this
design over to QMP.

To bring it back on topic, we need QMP on the dest to set parameters,
because -incoming  was limited to only take the URI.

If the "migrate-incoming" command accepted all parameters directly,
then we could use QAPI visitor to usupport a "-incoming ..." command
that took an arbitrary JSON document and turned it into a call to
"migrate-incoming".

With that we would never need QMP on the target for cpr-exec, avoiding
this ordering poblem you're facing....assuming we put processing of
-incoming at the right point in the code flow

Can we fix this design and expose the full configurability on the
CLI using QAPI schema & inline JSON, like we do for other QAPI-ified
CLI args.

It seems entirely practical to me to add parameters to 'migrate-incoming'
in a backwards compatible manner and deprecate set-parameters/capabilities

With regards,
Daniel
