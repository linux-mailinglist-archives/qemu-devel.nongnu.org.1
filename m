Not really. IMHO it is still viable to define a CLI arg using JSON and
QAPI, even if there's no need to use it from QMP.

Using JSON syntax exclusively is exactly what I'm suggesting. While some
command line args have invented ways to express nested types, we don't
really want to be in that business anymore. Anything complex should be
JSON syntax on the command line. We support this with -object, -device,
-audiodev, -netdev, -blockdev already, and eventually expect everything
to support JSON syntax.

You can see this in practice in libvirt, where we'll prefer JSON syntax
for any args that support it:

  https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/blob/master/tests/qemuxmlconfdata/x86_64-q35-graphics.x86_64-latest.args

The approach to retrofitting to an existing cli arg is pretty crude but
effective in QEMU. Just look if the first character is '{' and if so,
switch to QAPI based parsing instead of legacy parsing.

In terms of where we wire up CPR, -incoming or -cpr-uri is fairly
arbitrary and I'm not seeing (easy) better answers.

The (hard) better answer, would potentally be to leverage '-object'
to create the migration state object but that would be a massive
pile of work, that is unreasonable to ask you to experiment with.
