Hi Igor,

Yes, I was previously puzzled as to why the core_id of spapr is global,
which is completely different from the meaning of core_id in x86. Now,
your analogy has made it very clear to me. Thanks!

Thank you! Now I see.

Is it also because of architectural reasons that the smallest granularity
supported by spapr can only be the core?

Thank you. So, I would like to ask, should the elements in possible_cpus
be understood as the smallest granularity supported by hotplug?

I want to understand that this reason is unrelated to the loongarch patch,
instead I mainly want to continue thinking about my previous qom-topo[*]
proposal.

I remember your hotplug slides also mentioned larger granularity hotplug,
which I understand, for example, allows x86 to support core/socket, etc.
(this of course requires core/socket object abstraction).

If possible_cpus[] only needs to correspond to the smallest granularity
topo object, then it matches my qom-topo proposal quite well, essentially
mapping one layer of a complete topology tree (which is built from socket
to thread, layer by layer) to possible_cpus[] (actually, this is my design:
mapping the thread layer of the x86 topology tree to possible_cpus[]. :) )

Although many years have passed, I still believe that larger granularity
hotplug is valuable, especially as hardware includes more and more CPUs.

Thank you for your guidance. Similar to Bibo¡¯s question, I also wonder
if there is the need for a property that won't be exposed to users.
