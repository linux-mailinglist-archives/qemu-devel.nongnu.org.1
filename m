Note to other reviewers: transmogrifier output is
docs/manual/qapi/index.html.

This item is not even a regression.

The current doc generator auto-generates missing member documentation
("Not documented").  It doesn't auto-generate missing returns
documentation.  I explored auto-generating them, but shelved my work to
not interfere with yours.

What exactly are "pseudofeatures"?

Also not a regression.

Makes sense to me.

The changes to the QAPI generator core (scripts/qapi/) are small, and
spread over just four patches:

    qapi/source: allow multi-line QAPISourceInfo advancing
    qapi/schema: add __repr__ to QAPIDoc.Section
    qapi: expand tags to all doc sections
    qapi/parser: adjust info location for doc body section
