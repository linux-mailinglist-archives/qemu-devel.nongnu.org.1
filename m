Right, but consider that it's easy enough for someone to look for a
global object to write in the code, find the wrong one and just use
it. It would then be up to reviewers to catch the mistake.

Look at this:

  bool migration_is_idle(void)
  {
      MigrationState *s = current_migration;
      ...
  }
  
  bool migration_is_active(void)
  {
      MigrationState *s = global_migration;
      ...
  }

Of course we'll get this wrong at some point.

Also, if in the future someone decides to call migration_is_idle() from
outside migration/, we'd be not only adding the burden to change the
variable, but also the functional change at shutdown time.

If we're to carry on with this idea, we'll need to play with some
headers to properly isolate these two usages. Something like:

migration.h:
  bool migration_is_active_internal(MigrationState *s);
  void set_global_obj(MigrationState *obj);

migration.c:
  bool migration_is_active_internal(MigrationState *s)
  {
  }

  void migration_object_init(void)
  {
      set_global_object(MIGRATION_OBJ(object_new(TYPE_MIGRATION)));
  }

exports.h:
  #include migration.h
  bool migration_is_active(void);

exports.c:
  static MigrationState *global_migration;
  
  void set_global_obj(MigrationState *obj)
  {
      global_migration = obj;
  }
  
  bool migration_is_active(void)
  {
      return migration_is_active_internal(global_migration);
  }

That way, the internal code never calls the exported functions with
global, always with current.

We can discuss when we get to that point, but that might make the code
too cumbersome. Having to change signatures all the time to
include/remove MigrationState.

I'm afraid that's not enough, code changes after all. It's not possible
to carry these requirements to the future, we must account for the gaps
now.

Even code under migration/ ? All the various threads? The BQL is a
heavyweight lock. We shouldn't be adding more instances of it unless it
protects against something from the main loop/other subsystems.
