Hi, Odaki-san

The idea appears to be practical and convenient.

I have some things I want to confirm.
I understood your idea can make deices for VFs,
created by qdev_new or qdev_realize function, invisible from guest OS.
Is my understanding correct ?
And, if your idea is realized,
will it be possible to specify the backend device for the virtio-pci-net 
device ?

Could you provide insights into the next steps
beyond the implementation details ?
About when do you expect your implementation
to be merged into qemu ?
Do you have a timeline for this plan ?
Moreover, is there any way
we can collaborate on the implementation you're planning ?

Regards,

Yui Washizu
