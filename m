It's my poorly worded phrasing to say "userspace and QEMU must work in
tandem to complete the secure IPL operations".  Basically encapsulating
the bulleted list below.

"Interpretation" was a poor choice -- should have said "QEMU handling"
or something akin to that.  Will revisit when splitting this into specs
and doc.

Sure.  So, for the specs we can include the following sections:
 - s390 Secure IPL
 - s390 Certificate Store (description)
 - DIAG 320 and 508
 - Secure IPL Functions (and all sub sections)

For the docs:
 - Constraints
 - s390 Certificate Store (command line), probably rename this section
 - IPL Modes
 - Quickstart
