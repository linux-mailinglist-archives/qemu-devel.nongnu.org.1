Documentation needs to be clarified then.

A quick grep for the usual parser qobject_input_visitor_new() finds
-audiodev, -blockdev, -compat, -display, and -netdev.  Beware, the
latter two come with backward compatibility gunk.  There's also -device
and -object, also with backward compatibility gunk.

Simple example:

    JSON        -compat '{"deprecated-input": "reject", "deprecated-output": "hide"}
    dotted keys -compat deprecated-input=reject,deprecated-output=hide

Slightly more interesting:

    JSON        -audiodev '{"id": "audiodev0", "driver": "wav", "in": {"voices": 4}}'
    dotted keys -audiodev id=audiodev0,driver=wav,in.voices=4

Easy when an option supports it from the start: -audiodev, -blockdev,
-compat.  Awkward when we extend an existing option to support it:
-display, -netdev, -device, -object.

As far as I can tell at a glance, libvirt

* Remains unaware of -display JSON arguments

* Assumes -netdev accepts JSON when QMP netdev-add supports backend type
  "dgram", see commit 697e26fac66 (qemu: capabilities: Detect support
  for JSON args for -netdev) v8.10.0

* Assumes -device accepts JSON when QMP device_add has feature
  json-cli-hotplug, see commit 1a691fe1c84 (qemu: capabilities:
  Re-enable JSON syntax for -device) v8.1.0

* Assumes -object accepts JSON when object-add supports object type
  "secret", see commit f763b6e4390 (qemu: capabilities: Enable detection
  of QEMU_CAPS_OBJECT_QAPIFIED) v7.2.0

In theory, such indirect probing can fall apart when somebody backports
JSON syntax *without* the thing libvirt probes for.  They then get to
adjust libvirt's detection logic, too.  Hasn't been an issue in practice
as far as I know.

Might be good enough.

'feature' is best used sparingly.  But when it's needed, using it is
*fine*.

Yes, but it'll then have to support single channels both as list of one
channel object, and channel object, unlike migrate-incoming.

Syntactical differences between CLI and QMP for things that are
semantically identical add unnecessary complexity, don't you think?

I'm not sure.  Peter, what do you think?
