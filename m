Indeed - QEMU emulation of this is not complete.  It should also be generat=
ing
the events. Ideally we'd even handle injecting silent poison (not yet detec=
ted
by the device) and have that generate the synchronous memory faults on an a=
ccess.

Interesting question of whose problem this is.  For corrected
errors it's policy stuff that belongs in userspace, but for known
memory failure, it might want to be in kernel.

Shiju (+Cc) pointed me a the existing rasdaemon handling for corrected
errors (statistics get too bad, so memory offlined)=20
https://github.com/mchehab/rasdaemon/commit/9ae6b70effb8adc9572debc800b8e16=
173f74bb8

Poison detection via scrub though is reported via CPER Memory Error Section=
 with
"Scrub uncorrected error" set. That triggers apei handling. On
x86 looks to be apei_mce_report_mem_error(). Also triggers
the ghes_do_memory_failure_path() and ultimately memory_failure().

Conveniently there was a patch fixing the sync path last year
that includes info on what happens in async case.
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?=
id=3Da70297d2213253853e95f5b49651f924990c6d3b

"In addition, for aysnchronous errors, kernel will notify the
process who owns the poisoned page by sending SIGBUS with BUS_MCERRR_A0
in early kill mode."

So I think the kernel should probably do the same for CXL poison
error records when it gets them.
