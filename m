Thanks for that info Atish!

We are stuck in a bad situation.

The best solution would be if OpenSBI can release a 1.3.1, @Anup Patel
do you think you could do that?

Otherwise I think we should stick with OpenSBI 1.3. Considering that
it fixes UEFI boot issues for the virt board (which would be the most
used) it seems like a best call to make. People using the other boards
are unfortunately stuck building their own OpenSBI release.

If there is no OpenSBI 1.3.1 release we should add something to the
release notes. @Conor Dooley are you able to give a clear sentence on
how the boot fails?
