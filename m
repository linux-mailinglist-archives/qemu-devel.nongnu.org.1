We're looping on iov_send() on a non-blocking socket.

In the EAGAIN scenario we select() to wait for writability which is
good.

In the scenario where we wrote at least 1 byte, however, we have
the usleep(). Presumably the idea is that we should not immediately
try iov_send again as it might not be ready to send more data. This
should only be needed, however, if there is still more data waiting
to be sent and we should select() instead anyway. So I think this:

               do {
                   s = g_test_rand_int_range(0, j - k + 1);
                   r = iov_send(sv[1], iov, niov, k, s);
                   g_assert(memcmp(iov, siov, sizeof(*iov)*niov) == 0);
                   if (r >= 0) {
                       k += r;
                       usleep(g_test_rand_int_range(0, 30));
                   } else if (errno == EAGAIN) {
                       select(sv[1]+1, NULL, &fds, NULL, NULL);
                       continue;
                   } else {
                       perror("send");
                       exit(1);
                   }
               } while(k < j);

should change to:


               do {
                   s = g_test_rand_int_range(0, j - k + 1);
                   r = iov_send(sv[1], iov, niov, k, s);
                   g_assert(memcmp(iov, siov, sizeof(*iov)*niov) == 0);
		   if (r == -1 && errno == EAGAIN) {
		       r = 0;
		   }
                   if (r >= 0)
                       k += r;
		       if (k < j) {
                         select(sv[1]+1, NULL, &fds, NULL, NULL);
                         continue;
		       }
                   } else {
                       perror("send");
                       exit(1);
                   }
               } while(k < j);


With regards,
Daniel
