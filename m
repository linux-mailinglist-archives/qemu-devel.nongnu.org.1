Right, a backport should just remove the locking with it. That seems to
be a trivial conflict resolution.

It's only comments anyway, but the correct conflict resolution here is
to keep both comments.

Both of the merge conflicts you mentioned above don't really seem like
problems to me. Did you find any semantic merge conflicts? That's when I
would start to be concerned about fragility.

Seems you already resolved the conflicts the same was as I suggested
above.
