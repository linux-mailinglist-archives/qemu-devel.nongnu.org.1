Indeed, in our case it's the trusted hypervisor (RMM) that provides the
equivalent to TPM quote and PCRs. In more details:

1. QEMU loads images into guest RAM by calling KVM, which calls RMM.
2. RMM calculates a hash of the image content, adds it to a rolling hash
   the "Realm Initial Measurement" (RIM), which I believe is equivalent to
   a PCR.
3. During remote attestation, the guest sends evidence containing this RIM
   signed by the root of trust, along with a signed token identifying the
   platform (hardware, firmware, RMM).
4. The verifier checks the signature and the platform token, so it trusts
   the RMM and the RIM.

Absolutely, the verifier does not trust the content of the log, it only
uses the log as helper to try to reconstruct the RIM. For example a log
event says "I loaded image XYZ at address A", then the verifier searches
image XYZ in its database of known-good images, calculates the hash that
would result from loading that image at address A. Any malformed event in
the log causes the hash to diverge from the trusted RIM value, and causes
an attestation error.

Not directly, but I've heard of at least two options that are being
actively worked on:
* running payloads like SVSM and openhcl that emulate a TPM. In RMM 1.1
  there is a concept of "planes" that enables this.
* having edk2 in the VM provide a "fTPM".

I'm less familiar with these, but I think both need to connect the virtual
TPM to the root of trust by performing remote attestation via RMM (?). So
the problem of reconstructing a RIM on the verifier side remains, even if
it's not done by the application.

In addition I'm wondering about lighter, container-like workloads, which
will want to boot quickly and run the bare minimum software, and where
edk2 or SVSM seems superfluous. Maybe people will want to tailor those
workloads and avoid the extra layer?

Thanks,
Jean
