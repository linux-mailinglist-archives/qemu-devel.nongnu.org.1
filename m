I think KVM checks it in vgic_mmio_uaccess_write_v3_misc, however, current qemu
does not consider GICD_TYPER2 during migration.

In fact, I am wondering the description about GICD_TYPER2 in GIC spec. It said
"This register is present only when FEAT_GICv4p1 is implemented", from the view
of guest, we have a GICv3 device, however, we can see that GICD_TYPER2.nASSGIcap
is 1.

Make sense, in the case of v3->v4.1, source and destination will use SGI
with an active state.
