Instruction instrumentation is done before executing the instruction 
itself, as you can see by running:
./build/qemu-x86_64 -plugin build/tests/tcg/plugins/libinsn.so -d 
in_asm,op /usr/bin/true

I'm not entirely sure about the sequence when there is an exception 
while fetching the instruction though. You can give it a try, track the 
PC using insn instrumentation, and we can identify which cases are not 
working.

The test plugin itself is not complicated.
You'll need:
- one callback per instruction to set the expected pc (possibly 
optimized with inline operation), used to compare to from_pc, and we 
check if (optional) to_pc matches the current instruction.
- when the callback for discontinuity is called, we check if from_pc is 
matching, and register the next expected with to_pc.

We can then add tests targeting supported architectures using the 
plugin, and ensuring it never fails.
It's hard to know we don't miss events though. Except if we write manual 
assembly system mode tests, that trigger the expected behaviour. But it 
would be tedious, and I'm really not sure there is a real value with 
reduced examples like this.
