The memory device is connected to the host server while the size of the memory could be changed by the out-of-band fabric manager. If there is no memory assigned to the host, the CXL device will be booted as zero memory size.

Agreed, but...

It sounds like a pre DCD boot time only pooling solution?

What is the path to adding memory?

This isn't the ACPI bit, it's just the device reporting.  Can have a huge
CFMWS and tiny devices.

That doesn't really give me any indication of how the addition of memory happens.
