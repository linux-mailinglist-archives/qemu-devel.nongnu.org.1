If you build with --disable-plugins the compiler should dead code away
all the plugin hooks. But in general the overhead from unused plugins is
in the noise.

I have a vague memory that this is due to ppc running the interrupt
handling code more often than it should. But I forget the details.

Are there any functional tests that exhibit this slow IRQ handling
behaviour?
