Michael has indicated he wants to see the result of testing of riscv,
to validate stable releases don't regress.

Having it non-gating allows the possibility to look at the job and
evaluate whether a failure is due to genuine bugs, or distro problems.

Having it gating guarantees the the pipeline overall is going to be
marked failed whenever distro problems hit, which is worse as it
impacts everyone using CI.

With regards,
Daniel
