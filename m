Hi Roy,
thanks for this series!

I saw that the series has been a posted for a while and maybe you're 
going to send v2, so I'll bring back some little things that I saw, but 
I didn't do yet a deep review:

- We use "Isolated Guest Virtual Machine" or "Independent Guest Virtual
   Machine", are they interchangeable for IGVM?

- `./scripts/checkpatch.pl --codespell` reported some warnings:

5/9 Checking commit 81f60e5cdd01 (i386/pc: Process IGVM file during PC initialization if present)
WARNING: 'initalization' may be misspelled - perhaps 'initialization'?
#15:
     initalization of the target.
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

9/9 Checking commit 66745c0bb940 (docs/system: Add documentation on support for IGVM)

WARNING: 'encaspulate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'encapsulate'?
#27: FILE: docs/system/igvm.rst:4:
+IGVM files are designed to encaspulate all the information required to launch a
                             ^^^^^^^^^^^

Thanks,
Stefano
