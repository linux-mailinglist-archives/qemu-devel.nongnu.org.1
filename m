Let me explain it in my own words to make sure I understand.

1. The transmogrifier emits a :feat: for the feature like for any other.
   Therefore, the feature is rendered like any other.,

2. The transmogrifier additionally emits the owning directive with a
   :deprecated: option.  This gets the eye-catch rendered.

Example:

    Command drive-backup (Since: 1.6)
 -->    This command is deprecated.

       Start a point-in-time copy of a block device to a new destination.
       The status of ongoing drive-backup operations can be checked with
       query-block-jobs where the BlockJobInfo.type field has the value
       'backup'.  The operation can be stopped before it has completed
       using the block-job-cancel command.

       Arguments:
          * The members of "DriveBackup".

       Features:
 -->      * **deprecated** -- This command is deprecated.  Use "blockdev-
            backup" instead.

The first arrow marks the eye-catch.  The second marks the normally
rendered feature.

The eye-catch is redundant with the feature rendering.  Readers may
nevertheless find an eye-catch useful.

For what it's worth, the Python documentation has deprecation
information at the end of a definition documentation, together with
"changed in" information.  Both are colored to catch the eye.  More
restrained than your eye-catch.  Also uses less space.

Hmm.

Not a blocker.

Do you intend to drop this part in the final version?

Having the commit message explain paths not taken can be useful.  But
this is phrased as an RFC, which suggests to me you plan to drop it.
