Sorry if my previous comments misled you, when I previously talked about
linking via a "bus" property I was not considering the fact that "bus"
is a special property inside QEMU. From a libvirt POV we don't care what
the property is call - it was just intended to be a general illustration
of cross-referencing the iommu with the PCI bus it needed to be associated
with.
