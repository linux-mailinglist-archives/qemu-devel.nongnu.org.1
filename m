Just to mention, we will still need some special parameters that can change
during migration, like max-bandwidth, max-downtime etc.  So not all of them
can be made into "migrate"/"migrate-incoming" arguments.

Fabiano started working on handshake recently.  After that is ready, we
should logically also achieve similar goal at least for dest qemu so no
cap/parameter is ever needed there.
