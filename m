I think this is a good idea; we've had at least one bug
report from a user pointing out that we had a term in
our docs which we didn't define ("block driver"):
https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/2611
I have some comments on specific entries below.

I guess it makes sense to give this its own subdir, since we want
it to come at the end of the manual. The other option would be
to put it directly into docs/.

What's "simply" intended to mean here?

I think the correct term here is "machine" -- that's what the
command line option is named, it's what the QOM class is, etc.
So the major glossary entry should be "Machine". Some people
(including me!) and some of the documentation uses "board" as a
synonym for "machine", so we should have a glossary entry for
"board", but it should just say "Another name for 'machine'" and
xref to the "machine" entry.

SoCs are not the same as boards.

We could say something like:

QEMU's system emulation models many different types of hardware.
A machine model (sometimes called a board model) is the model
of a complete virtual system with RAM, one or more CPUs, and
various devices.

We could also put in a link to
https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/targets.html
which is where we document what our machine types are.

I think I would delete this paragraph. 'virt' is only the
board type for virtual machines for some architectures; on
x86 it doesn't exist for, example. Our user facing
docs (that link above) are where we should suggest what
the best machine type to use is. And the codebase-guide
page is where we would say where machine type source code is.

Block drivers aren't just disk formats; there are some filter
drivers too. Somebody on the block side could probably
provide a better definition here.

This definition doesn't actually define what a device is :-)

Replace last sentence with

We could also have an entry for Target

 The term "target" can be ambiguous. In most places in QEMU it is used
 as a synonym for "guest"; for example the code for emulating Arm CPUs
 is in ``target/arm/``. However in the TCG subsystem "target" refers
 to the architecture which QEMU is running on, i.e. the "host".

Patchwork and patchew are different systems. Patchew's URL is
https://patchew.org/QEMU/

(There is a patchwork instance that tracks qemu-devel patches,
at https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/qemu-devel/list/ , but
I'm not aware of any developers that are actively using it, so
I don't think it merits being mentioned in the glossary.)

I think we could probably also usefully say

"The QEMU project doesn't currently expect most developers to
directly submit pull requests."

just to flag up that our development model isn't like the
currently-popular github/gitlab one where a PR is how you
send contributions.

We want to be a bit careful here, because the "qcow" format
is not something we recommend for new use -- "qcow2" is what
you actually want.

https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/about/index.html already has
text defining system emulation and user emulation, so we don't
really need to re-invent new phrasing for those here.

I would say

  TCG is the QEMU Tiny Code Generator; it is the JIT system we use
  to emulate a guest CPU in software.

That's enough for users to understand what it means (I hope); if
they want to know more specifics like about the intermediate
representation they can follow the link.
