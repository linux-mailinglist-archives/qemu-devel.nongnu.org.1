No worries, I was not sure if you missed information or simply waited 
for more feedback, so I did well to ask you directly.

Sounds good to me. I agree that Daniel approach is simpler and better as 
well, as long as we accept the resulting changes in the schema, which 
seems ok for users.

Thus, I'll drop current series, and focus on respinning Daniel series 
and adding the changes requested.

Yes, I agree. At least we are all on the same page right now, I'll 
pursue Daniel's approach.
