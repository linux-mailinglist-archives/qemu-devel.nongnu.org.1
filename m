I think since there are other architectures already doing run-time
selectable endian I'm going to keep this in the series. I'll be replying
to the linux-kernel portion later when I'm less inclined to be rude to
Linus.

The linux-kernel changes are not huge so we could probably keep our own
out-of-tree for a bit, but I do not want to keep putting a lot of effort
into this without anyone else being interested.

Not sure if there would be any interested from any BSD for a kernel?
