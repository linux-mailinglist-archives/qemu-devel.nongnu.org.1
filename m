Then maybe:
CharFrontend - Chardev as seen by front end
would be less confusing,

Not listing all users but listing all such type names and their relation. 
Such as
Chardev - CharBackend
QEMUSoundCard - Audiodev (or whatever is that)
etc.
And do that before any renaming so we have all these types documented 
(that alone helps making these less confusing) then we can think of how to 
name them better without getting other inconsistency again. Just renaming 
few of them without considering all of them may not solve all 
inconsistency.
