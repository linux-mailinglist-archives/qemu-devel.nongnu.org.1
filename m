AI tools can be used as a natural language refactoring engine for simple
tasks such as modifying all callers of a given function or all accesses
to a variable.  These tasks are interesting for an exception because:

* it is credible for a contributor to claim DCO compliance.  If the
contributor can reasonably make the same change with different tools or
with just an editor, which tool is used (including an LLM) should have
no bearing on compliance.  This also applies to less simple tasks such
as adding Python type annotations.

* they are relatively easy to test and review, and can provide noticeable
time savings;

* this kind of change is easily separated from more complex non-AI-generated
ones, which we encourage people to do anyway.  It is therefore natural
to highlight them as AI-generated.

Make an exception for patches that have "limited creative content" - that
is, mechanical transformations where the creativity lies in deciding what
to change rather than in how to implement the change.
