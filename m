QOM design assumption: object_new() followed by object_unref() is always
possible and has no side effect.

QOM introspection relies on this.  Your PATCH 1 makes non-class
properties of singletons invisible in introspection.  Making something
with such properties a singleton would be a regression.

Anything that violates the design assumption must be delayed to a
suitable state transition.  For devices (subtypes of TYPE_DEVICE), this
is ->realize().  For user-creatable objects (provide interface
TYPE_USER_CREATABLE), this is ->complete().  For anything else, it's
something else that probably doesn't even exist, yet.  See "Problem 5:
QOM lacks a clear life cycle" in
