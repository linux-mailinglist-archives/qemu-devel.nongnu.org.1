I don't think so?  When with that patch, container will reference subregion
the same way as others, which is to take a refcount on the owner.  That
kept at least the refcount behavior consistent within memory_region_ref().

That patch removes the circular reference by always properly release the
circular reference due to sub-regioning internally.

Your patch added more complexity to me on refcounting, meanwhile it's also
not always "correct".  It can boil down to how you define "correct" - if
you mean one should always boost a refcount somewhere if it references one
MR, then it's still not 100% correct at least when mr->owner==NULL.  We
never yet did it alright, so to me it's a matter of working around current
sanitizer issue, and that's only about it yet so far.

Meanwhile I _think_ adding such complexity also means MR's finalize() will
be called in specific order when parent/child MRs belong to the same owner.
In my patch the order shouldn't matter, IIUC, which I preferred because
that reduces details that we may not care much (or I could have overlooked
why we need to care about it).  Basically that's simpler to maintain to me,
but again, I don't feel strongly until someone would like / be able to
rework MR refcounting completely.

Thanks,
