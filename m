Giving names is not an easy task... Removing _ST doesn't sound
right, as everything is GHES_ERR. STS sounds weird to me as well.
Maybe we could name them both as something like:

	GHES_ERR_STATUS_ADDR_OFF
	GHES_READ_ACK_ADDR_OFF

This is named after hest_addr_le, which in turn was named after ghes_hw_le.

Besides, I guess such name was suggested on a past review. From my side, 
I'm OK with any name you/Igor pick.

Yes. The variable sizes makes it harder to parse with current GHES
types. It sounds they'll fix it for the next types, as the size of
the record will be stored for types above 11.

So, at the end, we'll need to add a much more complex logic if/when
we add non-GHES records.

In short:

The type was already ensured when HEST table is built. I can't see
any need to add extra checks. If you want this to be better documented,
we could just do:

	hest_err_block_addr = err_source_struct + GHES_ERR_STATUS_ADDR_OFF + GAS_OFFSET;  

It follows a longer rationale:

If I understood well, and after some discussions we had today via chat,
you basically want to add an additional check logic during error inject
to check if the memory type filled at build_ghes_v2() here:

	/* Build Generic Hardware Error Source version 2 (GHESv2) */
	static void build_ghes_v2(GArray *table_data,
	                          BIOSLinker *linker,
       		                  const AcpiNotificationSourceId *notif_src,
                	          uint16_t index, int num_sources)
	{
...
	    /* Error Status Address */
	    build_append_gas(table_data, AML_AS_SYSTEM_MEMORY, 0x40, 0,
...
	    /*
	     * Read Ack Register 
	     * ACPI 6.1: 18.3.2.8 Generic Hardware Error Source
	     * version 2 (GHESv2 - Type 10)
	     */
	   build_append_gas(table_data, AML_AS_SYSTEM_MEMORY, 0x40, 0,
                     4 /* QWord access */, 0);
...
	}

was not modified and still remains AML_AS_SYSTEM_MEMORY, as otherwise the
code at get_ghes_source_offsets() won't be able to use 
cpu_physical_memory_read/cpu_physical_memory_write. To make it right,
IMO we would need to add something like this to aml-build.c:

	int verify_gas_addr_space(uint64_t addr, AmlAddressSpace as)
	{
		uint64_t gas_header;

		cpu_physical_memory_read(addr, &gas_header, 4);
		gas_header = cpu_to_le64(0);

		if ((gas_header & 0xff) != as)
			return 1;

		return 0;
	}

and at ghes.c do something like:

	// Using current names just to better illustrate the changes
	#define GHES_ACK_OFFSET          64 // don't add GAS_ADDR_OFFSET here
	#define GHES_ERR_ST_ADDR_OFFSET  20 // don't add GAS_ADDR_OFFSET here

	static void get_ghes_source_offsets(uint16_t source_id, uint64_t hest_addr,
	                                    uint64_t *cper_addr,
	       	                            uint64_t *read_ack_start_addr,
	                                    Error **errp)
	{
 
	    /* Navigate though table address pointers */
	    hest_err_block_addr = err_source_struct + GHES_ERR_ST_ADDR_OFFSET;

	    /* EXTRA CHECK LOGIC: Verify if build_ghes_v2() did his job */
	    if (verify_gas_addr_space(hest_err_block_addr, AML_AS_SYSTEM_MEMORY)} {
		error_setg(errp, "HEST firmware is not using system memory!!!");
		return;
	    }
	    hest_err_block_addr += GAS_ADDR_OFFSET;

	    hest_read_ack_addr = err_source_struct + GHES_ACK_OFFSET;

	    /* EXTRA CHECK LOGIC: Verify if build_ghes_v2() did his job */
	    if (verify_gas_addr_space(hest_read_ack_addr, AML_AS_SYSTEM_MEMORY)} {
		error_setg(errp, "HEST firmware is not using system memory!!!");
		return;
	    }
	    hest_read_ack_addr += GAS_ADDR_OFFSET;

	    cpu_physical_memory_read(hest_err_block_addr, &error_block_addr,
	                             sizeof(error_block_addr));

	    cpu_physical_memory_read(error_block_addr, cper_addr,
	                             sizeof(*cper_addr));

	    cpu_physical_memory_read(hest_read_ack_addr, read_ack_start_addr,
	                             sizeof(*read_ack_start_addr));
	}

IMO, this is overkill:
- I can't see how such check will ever be triggered in practice;
- I can't see any reason why the HEST firmware would ever be stored
  on a non-system memory: firmware should always be at 
  AML_AS_SYSTEM_MEMORY;
- As those offsets are related to fw_cfg, any change there would
  require changing the firmware binding logic. Plus, they'll very
  likely also require changes at BIOS code itself, as it would need
  to know how to store firmware files on some other memory type;
- Any change like that will certainly require adding backport support,
  as QEMU would need to check if BIOS would support different types
  of memory to store firmware instead of system memory. Also, QEMU 9.1
  is only compatible with firmware stored on system's memory. 

So, I don't see any benefit of doing that.
