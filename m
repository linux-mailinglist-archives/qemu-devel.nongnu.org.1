My point here was that the scalability problem will most likely get more

It's not the amount of data to load matters here but that these address
space operations are slow.

The whole config load takes ~70 ms per device - that's time equivalent
of transferring 875 MiB of device state via a 100 GBit/s link.

In the future we want to not only transfer but also load the config data
in parallel.

So going back to transferring this data serialized via the main migration
channel would be taking a step back here.

By the way, we already have a serialization point in
qemu_savevm_state_complete_precopy_iterable() after iterables have been sent -
waiting for device state sending threads to finish their work.

Whether this thread_pool_wait() operation will be implemented using
semaphores I'm not sure yet - will depend on how well this will fit other
GThreadPool internals.

What do you mean by "re-entrant" here?

This handler is called only from single migration thread, so it cannot
be re-entered anyway since the control doesn't return to the migration
code until this handler exits (and obviously the handler won't call
itself recursively).

I don't quite understand that - why do you think that caller needs to
know whether this is the "1st invocation of the function"?

The caller only tracks whether all these handlers reported that they
finished their work:
>       bool all_ready = true;
>       QTAILQ_FOREACH(se, &savevm_state.handlers, entry) {
>           bool this_ready;
> 
>           ret = se->ops->load_finish(se->opaque, &this_ready, &local_err);
>           if (ret) {
>           } else if (!this_ready) {
>               all_ready = false;
>           }
>
>       }
>       if (all_ready) {
>             break;
>       }

Could you elaborate what do you mean by "that non vmstate handler ever requested"?

Once we have ability to load device config state outside main migration
thread replacing "load_finish" handler with a semaphore should indeed be
possible (that's internal migration API so there should be no issue
removing it as not necessary anymore at this point).

But for now, the devices need to have ability to run their config load
code on the main migration thread, and for that they need to be called
from this handler "load_finish".

To be clear, I made a following diagram describing how the patch set
is supposed to work right now, including changing per-device
VFIO_MIG_FLAG_DEV_DATA_STATE_COMPLETE into a common MIG_CMD_SWITCHOVER.

Time flows on it left to right (->).

----------- DIAGRAM START -----------
Source overall flow:
Main channel: live VM phase data -> MIG_CMD_SWITCHOVER -> iterable                                                                          -> non iterable
Multifd channels:                                       \ multifd device state read and queue (1) -> multifd config data read and queue (1) /

Target overall flow:
Main channel: live VM phase data -> MIG_CMD_SWITCHOVER -> iterable -> non iterable -> config data load operations
Multifd channels:                                       \ multifd device state (1) -> multifd config data read (1)

Target config data load operations flow:
multifd config data read (1) -> config data load (2)

Notes:
(1): per device threads running in parallel
(2): currently serialized (only one such operation running at a particular time), will hopefully be parallelized in the future
----------- DIAGRAM END -----------

Hope the diagram survived being pasted into an e-mail message.

One can see, that even now there's a bit of "low hanging fruit" of missing
possible parallelism:
It seems that the source could wait for multifd device state + multifd config
data *after* non-iterables are sent rather than before as it is done
currently - so they will be sent in parallel with multifd data.

Since written description is often prone to misunderstanding
could you please annotate that diagram with your proposed new flow?

Thanks,
Maciej
