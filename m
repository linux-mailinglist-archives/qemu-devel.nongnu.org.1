Yep, mocking often ends up being rather a double-edged sword.
You can do some really powerful things with it, and in particular
it can enable you test scenarios / code paths that are hard or
impractical to exercise with regular functional tests where fault
injection is difficult/impossible.

The cost of this though is that the mocks can pose a significant
ongoing maint burden on anyone who refactors code in future, as
the mocks need to evolve in lockstep with the code refactoring.

12 months down the line, it can be hard for another maintainer
to understand the full purpose of the mocks & thus even harder
to know what todo as they refactor the code. The future burden
of mocks rarely falls on the person who creates them in the
first place.
