Just to clarify: is this supposed to be happening inside the GTK+ library
itself? i.e. GTK should spawn its own thread to poll file descriptors that
are owned by GTK? (As opposed to the file descriptors used by QEMU's own
event loop - what on Linux are eventfds, but on macOS I think are just
pipes*.)

This doesn't describe what I'm seeing when I run with -display gtk on
macOS. There's no extra thread created. There's a dock icon, but it's
non-interactive ("Application not responding"), there aren't any menus, and
there's no window. QEMU's own simulation is running in the background - I
can reach a guest via the network. So I guess there's some function in GTK
we're supposed to be calling that will make it crank the native event loop
on macOS, but this isn't being done?

Or do you mean there exists a global "block here forever" function in GTK
we can call from the main thread and which will make everything spring into
life, but that brings with it the same requirement as with the Cocoa UI:
moving everything that was originally on the main thread onto a background
thread. (I've done some searching for GTK docs and other background info
but anything I've found has been rather thin on this topic. The ui/gtk*.c
source is also not particularly enlightening - it seems to imply that
something in the background ought to be handling events somewhere.)

[* The event loop in QEMU on macOS probably ought to use a kqueue, with
EVFILT_USER where eventfds are used on Linux, except the rough equivalent
of ioeventfds are Mach ports which can be handled via EVFILT_MACHPORT, but
I digress.]

As long as it's clear that any handlers that go through the CFRunLoop

I'm not entirely sure what you're getting at here, to be honest. The UI
thread can definitely not assume to be holding the BQL all the time; we'd
have to treat it more like an AIOContext. It could pave the way towards
putting the display and UI subsystems on their own AIOContext or
AIOContext-like-thing, rather than hogging the BQL for expensive image
operations.

(*By the sound of it, Win32 has an all-UI-calls-on-one-thread requirement
as well which we may be violating to some degree via the GTK and/or SDL
backends as well; my adventures with Win32 are almost 20 years back now so
I'm a bit out of the loop there.)
