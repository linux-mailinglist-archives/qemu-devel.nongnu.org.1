I'm not suggesting that OVMF uses the fw_cfg files to check, just to
use an interface that is readable by the guest OS. If the values are
wrong, then you can't reconstruct the measurement in the attestation
report and the host just DoSes the guest, which is already possible
without this change.

TDX measures information after launch into RTMRs, which SEV-SNP doesn't hav=

This is not true of our environment, where every release of the
hypervisor includes a fresh build of the firmware, which may have
codegen differences for multiple reasons. We don't have a way to
announce ahead of time which firmware an instance will get for them to
sign an initial measurement derived from it.

Yes indeed, I've written one myself. Publishing it has been a bit
Kafkaesque as opposed to the go-sev-guest and go-configfs-tsm
libraries.
The problem is still preauthorization when it'd be much more
preferable to authorize components of a measurement and derive the
SEV-SNP attestation from the components.

Okay, do you know which direction the solution is moving? I know
there's a measured TPM firmware change proposed to the TCG, but that's
a bit too specific.

Is that the pathway you'd recommend? I'm not sure a new EV_S_CRTM_*
event for each SEV hash table entry for Qemu (say) is going to be
ratified.
