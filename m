This has spilled the most developer blood of any other problem with the
Python-based tests. Be very careful here.

I still have a prototype for replacing QMPMachine with an asyncio variant
that should have more robust logging features, but I put it on the
back-burner.

Avocado tests are the primary user of the QMP Machine interface I hate the
very most, a multi-threaded buffer-reader that works only by the grace of
god. If you do go down this path, I may want to take the opportunity to
abolish that interface once and for all.

I think simplifying the console buffering will help ease debuggability.

(Note, this isn't an avocado exclusive problem so much as it is the
emergent evolution of both qmp machine and avocado developing their own
solutions to console logging problems, resulting in two layers that are
trying to do similar things.)

I'm personally ambivalent on avocado; I use it for the python self-tests as
dogfooding but I can likely switch back over to plain pytest if that's the
direction we head. I don't think I use any crazy features except some
asyncio helpers i advocated for. I'm not sure what pytest's asyncio support
looks like, but I have to imagine as the premier testing framework that it
has *something* for me to use.

My only ask is that we keep the tests running in the custom venv
environment we set up at build time. We have some funky post-hoc
initialization of avocado that allows us to use internet packages
post-config for testing purposes. If we move to pytest, it's possible we
can eliminate that funkiness, which would be a win.

I'm also not so sure about recreating all of the framework that pulls vm
images on demand, that sounds like it'd be a lot of work, but maybe I'm
wrong about that.

Tacit ACK from me on this project in general, provided we are still using
the configure venv.
