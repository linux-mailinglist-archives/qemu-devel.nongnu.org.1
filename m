Sure, you got it. I think I did name it that at one point and then
said "Well, these are all deps, that's kind of redundant", but
greppability is a reasonable thing.

checktests?

Sure, that's one way.

Pattern #1: each dependency group should contain everything it needs
to run the tests/functionality associated with that dependency group
Pattern #2: each dependency group should specify only the unique
packages associated with that functionality

#1: dep groups are self-contained and easy to invoke, but dep groups
could theoretically drift with conflicting package versions.
#2: package deps are factored out and can't conflict, but those
modifying the build system may need to remember that they need
multiple dependency groups for certain classes of test.

I went with #1; if we go to #2, it just means that functests need to
have a dependency on both tests/functests groups. That's fine too.
Which is better? I don't really actually have enough insight to have a
preference on this one. RFC?

On the subject of "make check-venv": I wasn't able to figure out how
to really specify the deps for functests yet, I am still kind of
hammering away at it like a child with a squeaky toy hammer... "make
check" will invoke (some) iotests; the deps I added to meson in this
series will adequately detect and cover this when you run this
high-level target. However, "make check" will also run some of the
func+quick tests, and I *didn't* specify the dependency there, and if
you run make check with -j#, those tests can actually fail. (Well,
once the in-tree library is removed, that is.)

Ideally I want to get rid of "make check-venv" entirely and use only
meson targets that add dependency groups on demand, so I need to
figure out the right places to inject these dependencies in the build
system, and I've been having trouble figuring that out.

If after my waffling above you still think that's the right way to go,
I'm happy to do it. I just need to figure out how to axe the
check-venv target, too, I think.
