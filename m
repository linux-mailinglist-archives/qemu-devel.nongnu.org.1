This patch series (V2) introduces several cleanups and improvements to the smmu-testdev device. The main goals are to refactor shared code, enhance robustness, and significantly clarify the complex page table construction used for testing.

Motivation
----------

Currently, thoroughly testing the SMMUv3 emulation requires a significant
software stack. We need to boot a full guest operating system (like Linux)
with the appropriate drivers (e.g., IOMMUFD) and rely on firmware (e.g.,
ACPI with IORT tables or Hafnium) to correctly configure the SMMU and
orchestrate DMA from a peripheral device.

This dependency on a complex software stack presents several challenges:

* High Barrier to Entry: Writing targeted tests for specific SMMU
    features (like fault handling, specific translation regimes, etc.)
    becomes cumbersome.

* Difficult to Debug: It's hard to distinguish whether a bug originates
    from the SMMU emulation itself, the guest driver, the firmware
    tables, or the guest kernel's configuration.

* Slow Iteration: The need to boot a full guest OS slows down the
    development and testing cycle.

The primary goal of this work is to create a lightweight, self-contained
testing environment that allows us to exercise the SMMU's core logic
directly at the qtest level, removing the need for any guest-side software.

Our Approach: A Dedicated Test Device
-------------------------------------

To achieve this, we introduce two main components:

* A new, minimal hardware device: smmu-testdev.
* A corresponding qtest that drives this device to generate SMMU-bound
    traffic.

A key question is, "Why introduce a new smmu-testdev instead of using an
existing PCIe or platform device?"

The answer lies in our goal to minimize complexity. Standard devices,
whether PCIe or platform, come with their own intricate initialization
protocols and often require a complex driver state machine to function.
Using them would re-introduce the very driver-level complexity we aim to
avoid.

The smmu-testdev is intentionally not a conformant, general-purpose PCIe
or platform device. It is a purpose-built, highly simplified "DMA engine."
I've designed it to be analogous to a minimal PCIe Root Complex that
bypasses the full, realistic topology (Host Bridges, Switches, Endpoints)
to provide a direct, programmable path for a DMA request to reach the SMMU.
Its sole purpose is to trigger a DMA transaction when its registers are
written to, making it perfectly suited for direct control from a test
environment like qtest.

The Qtest Framework
-------------------

The new qtest (smmu-testdev-qtest.c) serves as the "bare-metal driver"
for both the SMMU and the smmu-testdev. It manually performs all the
setup that would typically be handled by the guest kernel and firmware,
but in a completely controlled and predictable manner:

1.  SMMU Configuration: It directly initializes the SMMU's registers to a
    known state.

2.  Translation Structure Setup: It manually constructs the necessary
    translation structures in memory, including Stream Table Entries
    (STEs), Context Descriptors (CDs), and Page Tables (PTEs).

3.  DMA Trigger: It programs the smmu-testdev to initiate a DMA operation
    targeting a specific IOVA.

4.  Verification: It waits for the transaction to complete and verifies
    that the memory was accessed correctly after address translation by
    the SMMU.

This framework provides a solid and extensible foundation for validating
the SMMU's core translation paths. The initial test included in this
series covers a basic DMA completion path in the Non-Secure bank,
serving as a smoke test and a proof of concept.

It is worth noting that this series currently only includes tests for the
Non-Secure SMMU. I am aware of the ongoing discussions and RFC patches
for Secure SMMU support. To avoid a dependency on unmerged work, this
submission does not include tests for the Secure world. However, I have
already implemented these tests locally, and I am prepared to submit
them for review as soon as the core Secure SMMU support is merged
upstream.


Changes from v1 RFC:
- Clarify Page Table Construction:
Detailed comments have been added to the page table construction logic. This is a key improvement, as the test setup extensively re-uses the same set of page tables for multiple translation stages and purposes (e.g., nested S1/S2 walks, CD fetch). The new comments explain this sharing mechanism, which can otherwise be confusing to follow.

- Refactor Shared Helpers:
The helper functions std_space_offset and std_space_to_str are now moved to a common header file. This allows them to be used by both the main device implementation (hw/misc/smmu-testdev.c) and its qtest (tests/qtest/smmu-testdev-qtest.c), improving code re-use and maintainability.

- Enhance Robustness:
Assertions have been added to ensure the device operates only in the expected Non-secure context. Additional conditional checks are also included to prevent potential runtime errors and make the test device more stable.

- Code Simplification and Cleanup:
Several functions that were redundant with existing macros for constructing Context Descriptors (CD) and Stream Table Entries (STE) have been removed. This simplifies the test data setup and reduces code duplication.

Other unused code fragments have also been removed to improve overall code clarity and hygiene.
