I prefer generic commands over collecting ad hoc single-purpose
commands, too.  Getting the design right can be difficult.

Works well, except when we need to access / manage onboard devices.
That's still an unsolved problem.

Unclear.

I feel it's best to start the design process with ensvisaged uses.  Can
you tell me a bit more about the uses you have in mind?

Maybe.

QAPI schema introspection (query-qmp-schema) has been a success.  It has
a reasonably expressive type system, deprecation information, and hides
much implementation detail.  Sadly, it doesn't cover most of QOM and all
of qdev due to QAPI schema bypass.

QOM type introspection (qom-list-types and qom-list-properties) is weak.
You can retrieve a property's name and type.  The latter is seriously
underspecified, and somewhere between annoying and impossible to use
reliably.  Properties created in certain ways are not visible here.
These are rare.

QOM object introspection (qom-list) is the same for concrete objects
rather than types.

qdev introspection (device-list-properties) is like QOM type
introspection.  I'm not sure why it exists.  Use QOM type introspection
instead.

QOM introspection is servicable for checking whether a certain property
exists.  Examining a property's type is unadvisable.
