how about

kvm_arch_init()
    ...
    if (enable_cpu_pm) {                                                         
        int disable_exits = kvm_check_extension(s, KVM_CAP_X86_DISABLE_EXITS);

#define KVM_X86_DISABLE_EXITS_HLT KVM_X86_DISABLE_EXITS_HTL

above comment probably needs to be cleaned up

        if (disable_exits) {
