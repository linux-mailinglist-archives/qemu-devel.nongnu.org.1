Unfortunately it's not. I proposed such patch which I think would have 
simplified this and allowed real Mac ROM to work eventually but it wasn't 
accepted in OpenBIOS so instead the driver is still passed through fw_cfg. 
But this would be possible and I've tested that before and submitted 
patches for Mac machines emulation.

I don't know if anything uses NIC ROMs, some drivers may need some data or 
get MAC address from there or something like that so maybe not all ROMs 
can be disabled but maybe could be done one by one for each card after 
testing. Or just disable it for virtio-net?

For VGA cards some ROM is usually needed and machine firmwares may have 
BIOS and x86 emulation to run them even on non x86 machines. All the old 
PPC machines I emulate have such emulator in firmware but they can't run 
the current QEMU supplied ROMs so this is mostly relevant for passed 
through cards. It works with Bochs vgabios as documented here:
