Fair point.  A 'few' error types might be helpful to general
users like the original memory error injection this is built
on which is reduce blast radius of a real error (and used in
production VMM cases), but most are about testing the rest
of the stack, not really QEMU.

So it's very helpful for a smallish group of users.

To be clear we are talking here about a script that
generates 'similar' stuff to ACPI EINJ does and injects
via qapi, not guest injection (which is almost always locked
down on production machines / distros because of the footgun
aspect).  + ACPI EINJ interface suffers exactly the same
problems with state discoverability we have with a raw interface here.
(I checked with Mauro offline that I'd interpreted this
comment correctly!)

We could strip back the QAPI part to only the bits that are
not dependent on state.  However, the kicker to that is we'd
need to make sure all that state is available to an external
tool (or fully controllable from initial launch command line).
I'm not sure where the gaps are but, I'm fairly sure there
will be some.  Doesn't save much code other than documentation
of the QAPI.

For CXL stuff we'll piggy back on native error injection interfaces
that are already there and couldn't be avoided because they
are writing a bunch of register state (that we elide in the FW
first path). 
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20240205141940.31111-12-Jonathan.Cameron@huawei.com/
So we won't be adding new QAPI, but the error record generation logic
will be in QEMU.  For background, the CXL FW first error injection
has taken a back seat to the ARM errors because of the obvious
other factor that CXL isn't supported on ARM in upstream QEMU.
Once I escape a few near term deadlines I'll add the x86
support for GHESv2 / SCI interrupt signaling as you'd see on a
typical x86 server.

Could blend the two options and provide no qapi for the bits
that are QEMU state dependent - if fuzzing, can inject
the full record raw as doesn't have to be valid state anyway.

Agreed. I'd also be very keen that the script is tightly coupled to
QEMU as doesn't make sense to carry with kernel or RAS daemon and
I'd want to ultimately get this stuff into all the appropriate
CI flows.

So tricky questions. I'm not sure which way is the least painful!
