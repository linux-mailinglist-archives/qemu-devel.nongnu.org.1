I don't think there's any point to doing anything differently than we currently do: place 
the data at the end of the TB.

(1) The architectures that we host and use the constant pool currently have
     relatively large displacements: aarch64 (21 bit), x86_64 (32 bit),
     ppc (16 or 34 bit (power10 only)), riscv (32 bit), s390x (34 bit).

(2) The size of a TB pretty generally maxes out at 3-4k, but is firmly capped at 64k
     by uint16_t TranslationBlock.jmp_reset_offset.

(3) The 16 and 21-bit offsets are not large enough to stretch to a read-only mapping.

(4) Memory management of TranslationBlocks becomes *much* more complicated.

TCGConstant isn't bad, but I think I prefer TCGPoolData as mooted before.

The organization of tcg.h is from antiquity.  I am actively trying to reduce the size of 
the exported API.
