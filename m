Exactly. I agree! However the patch states:

+The QEMU project thus requires that contributors refrain from using AI content
+generators on patches intended to be submitted to the project, and will
+decline any contribution if use of AI is either known or suspected.

and makes no exception for non copyrighteable parts of the patch.

Or do I misunderstand?

Agree again! What worries me is that the patch as posted here does
not make contributors question anything. It just flatly forbids using "AI
content generators".
