You're mixing distinct concepts here. fallocate makes a file region
non-sparse, while O_TRUNC removes all existing allocation, making it
sparse if we write at non-contiguous offsets. I don't think we would
want to call fallocate, since we /want/ a sparse file so that we
don't needlessly store large regions of all-zeros as RAM maps.

Daniel
