I'm thinking about the opposite case where KVM is configured for R/W but
the mmap is more restrictive. This patch series makes this scenario
possible.

I think KVM probably treats the fault as a misconfiguration that host user
space needs to resolve. There might be no way to inject a page fault into
the guest because the access is allowed according to the guest page tables
and the guest fault handlers aren't prepared to deal with a spurious fault.

Let's see what happens in practice. I think the cleanest solution would be
to create separate kvm.ko memory regions with the appropriate permissions
(i.e. might require creating multiple MemoryRegions inside QEMU for a
single VIRTIO Shared Memory Region when permissions vary between mmaps).
