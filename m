If both are made up, I would sync them, either patching the
documentation or the ghes driver.

Fuzz the limits could be interesting, but it is not on my
current plans.

Yet, 1K could be a little bit short for ARM CPER.

See: N.26 ARMv8 AArch64 GPRs (Type 4) has 256 bytes for
registers, plus 8 bytes for the header. So, a total size of
264 bytes, for a single context register dump. I would expect
that, in real life, type 4 to always be reported on aarch64,
on BIOS with context register support. Maybe other types could
also be dumped altogether (like context registers for EL1, 
EL2 and/or EL3).

If just one type 4 context is encoded, it means that, 1K has 
space for 23 errors (of a max limit of 255).

Just looking at the maximum number, my feeling is that 1K
might be too short to simulate some real life reports,
but that depends on how firmware is actually grouping
such events.

So, maybe this could be expanded to, let's say, 4K, thus
aligning with the ReST documentation.

Mauro
