I'm not an expert in it, for the most part it can set up a machine as
usual, but the test case itself pokes at the machine directly by
talking to an interface on the host that can run memory access, qmp
commands, etc.

Can just make things easier and faster to set up and orchestrate than
doing it from within the target machine code.

No that's okay, thanks for the input. Finding a platform with
broken msi could be an interesting test. I'll check it out.

Yeah, I ended up beginning with that, but ended up running into some of
these issues and ended up being more code due to duplicating the non
exclusive case.

I'll stick with open-coding it for now, but it almost seems like there
could be an API call that could encompass exclusive and non-exclusive
cases in one. Would probably be good to have more than one caller before
trying to refactor it though.

Thanks,
Nick
