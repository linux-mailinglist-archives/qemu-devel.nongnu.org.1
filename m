Well, the cirrus has a 2d blitter implementation which I'd rate
problematic from both security and correctness point of view.

Also any guest new enough to still receive security updates can surely
use stdvga instead.  The "operating system museum" is IMHO pretty much
the only use case where it possibly might make sense to continue using
cirrus.

Having sayed that maybe the boolean classification -- be deprecated
or not -- is too simple.  The number of devices we can actually
deprecate and remove is probably relatively small.  But there also is
a large number of old-ish devices which only make sense in very few use
cases.  When running an old OS.  Or when emulating an old board.  Which
also tend to be not maintained very well because there are not many
users.  Maybe we need an "unsupported" state for them, with some
infrastructure like an easy way to compile qemu without unsupported
devices and an option to get warnings from qemu in case an unsupported
device is used.

take care,
  Gerd
