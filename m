Re-building 'std' for QEMU would be a no-go for many distros who
will expect QEMU to use the distro provided 'std' package. So at
most that would have to be an optional feature.

"strong" is a rather fuzzy term. In C we already have a huge number
of build dependencies

 $ wc -l tests/lcitool/projects/qemu.yml 
 127 tests/lcitool/projects/qemu.yml

we would have many more than that except that we're conservative
about adding deps on things because getting new libraries into
distros is quite painful, or we lag behind where we would want
to be to stick with compat for old distro versions.

In terms of Rust dependancies, I'd expect us to have fairly arbitrary
dependancies used. If the dep avoids QEMU maintainers having to
re-invent the wheel for something there is already a common crate
for, then it is a good thing to use it. I'd almost go as far as
encouraging use of external crates. Our maintainers should focus tmie
on writing code that's delivers compelling features to QEMU, rather
than re-creating common APIs that already have good crates.

A local git clone is already not buildable without network access,
given that you have to install countless extra distro packages
ahead of time. I think its reasonable to expect people working from
git to have to download rust deps. We should consider whether we
want vendoring in the release tarballs though.

I expect this will evolve organically with people providing wrappers
where appropriate to suit their development neds.

Rust isn't going away, so if a platform wants to remain relevant
to the modern software world, then people who care about that
platform need to ensure Rust works on it. I wouldn't say that
QEMU needs to massively worry about this, since all the common
platforms are now covered precisely because Rust is becoming
so wildly used that a platform cannot ignore it.
