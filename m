That was something we aimed to intentionally avoid specifying in the
policy. It is very hard to define it in a way that will be clearly
understood by all contributors.

Furthermore by defining it explicitly QEMU also weakens its legal
position should any issues arise, because it has pre-emptively
documented its acceptance of certain scenearios. This has the effect
of directing risk away from contributors and back onto the project.

We want to be very clear that the burden / requirement for determining
legal / license compliance of contributions rests on the contributor,
not the project, whether AI is involve or not.

In terms of historical practice, when contributors have come to us
with legal questions about whether they can contribute something or
the legality of cerati nchange, as a general rule we will avoid
giving any clear legal guidance from the project's POV.

Especially with any corporate contributor the rule is to refer that
person back to their own organization's legal department. This makes
it clear where the responsibility is and avoids the QEMU project
pre-emptively setting out its legal interpretation.

TL;DR: I don't think we should attempt to define whether the boundary
is between copyrightable and non-copyrightable code changes. 

With regards,
Daniel
