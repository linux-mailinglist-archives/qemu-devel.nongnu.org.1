As a general rule, if you ever find yourself asking "should we add more
magic parsing logic" to the command line argv, the answer should always
be 'no'.

Any command line args where we need to have more expressive formatting
are getting converted to accept JSON syntax, backed by QAPI modelling.
We were anticipating that '-incoming' should ideally end up deprecated
except for the plain "defer" option, on the expectation that any non-
trivial use of migration needs HMP/QMP regardless. If there's a vaild
use case for something other than 'defer', then we need to QAPI-ify
-incoming with JSON syntax IMHO.

Yes, there's still the question of HMP, but personally I'm fine with
leaving feature gaps in HMP and expecting people to use QMP. HMP shares
all the same flaws as our old approach to the CLI, of needing to invent
arbitrary magic syntaxes which has proved to be an undesirble path to
take in general. I see HMP as being there for the 80% common / simple
cases, and if you need to go beyond that, then QMP is there for you.


With regards,
Daniel
