I'll see if I can figure out what is happening there.

That sounds like another TCG issue, or possibly the DMA bounce buffer
problem resurfacing.  It's not directly related to his NUMA aspect unless
something very odd is going on.  I'm even more confused because I think
you are not using kmem with the above commands, so we shouldn't be using
the CXL memory for virtio.

Just to check, you aren't running with KVM I hope?  That opens a much
bigger problem set. :(
