Hi Yao,

If you have time, please spin a v2 that also sets the relevant
flag to say the QEMU emulation supports this interleave.

Whilst we test the kernel fixes, we can just drop that patch but longer term I'm
find with having this support in general in the QEMU emulation - so I won't queue
it up as a fix, but instead as a feature.

Thanks,

Jonathan
