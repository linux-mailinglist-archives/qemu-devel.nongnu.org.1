One idea would be to convert these to sugar and configure the relevant
features instead. The accelerator-specific properties would need to
either stay or be deprecated and later removed, I think; I'd hope there
are as few as possible of those. The ones requiring to actively do
something (e.g. enable MTE with KVM) are the fun ones.

Alternatively (or additionally?), provide a way to discover the set of
writable id regs, e.g. via a qmp command that returns what QEMU got from
KVM_ARM_GET_REG_WRITABLE_MASKS.

I would go with Armv8.6, Armv9.2, etc. that include the mandatory
features, and additionally the features that can go on top (base model,
can be extended; this is similar to what we already have e.g. for s390
z<whatever> models, but allows for the complication that we have many
vendors doing many different designs.) Not sure if we'd also want models
for specific cpus, but that could go on top, I guess.

Base data struct for all accelerators and used for accelerator-agnostic
code, accelerator-specific structures on top (so that we can add new
accelerators, if wanted?) Once the cpu is up and running, we're not
manipulating the regs anyway.
