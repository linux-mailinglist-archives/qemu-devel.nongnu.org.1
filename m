As you say, with meson, if the distro does not provide a new enough
version, then we pull a suitable version into the venv, overriding
what the distro provides.

IMHO that has set a precedent for /any/ python component we need during
build.

To put it another way....

The distro build platform matrix rules *only* apply to python runtime,
not to python modules. We will bump the min version of python modules
as suits QEMU, without being held back by distro versions.

With this POV, there is nothing special about sphinx.

If we want to bump min sphinx to get a newer version, then we should
just do it.

The only important bit is that our tool for populating the venv must
"do the right thing" detecting that the distro version is too old,
and downloading newer sphinx automatically, so users don't suddenly
loose docs.

With regards,
Daniel
