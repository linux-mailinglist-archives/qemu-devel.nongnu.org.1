I have doubts about this one.

The comment isn't great to begin with.  It's from commit 78b18b78aa8
(blockdev: add Abort transaction):

    blockdev: add Abort transaction
    
    The Abort action can be used to test QMP 'transaction' failure.  Add it
    as the last action to exercise the .abort() and .cleanup() code paths
    for all previous actions.

So, Abort for testing transactionable commands' handling of transaction
failure, not for testing failure of the transaction command.  But the
link points to the command, and thus suggests it's about command failure.

Ideally, we'd point to some "introduction to transactions" text.  We
don't have one.

The other occurences of `transaction` are similarly problematic, except
for one noted below.  Let's leave the problematic ones alone in this
patch, to keep it mechanical and uncontroversial.

Not this patch's problem: the transaction command's doc comment is
*crap*.  Most of it discusses about snapshots, as if snapshots where the
only transactionable commands.  It talks about "the dictionary", and the
reader can only guess what that might mean.
