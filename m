I understand! I will provide more comprehensive testing methods
and results as soon as possible and will get back to you.

What would be the benefit of doing that? If we're going to
say "we'll make accesses to regions without devices not
generate faults", the simplest way to do that is to
leave the ignore_memory_transaction_failures flag set

I don't think that using a 4GB unimplemented-device is
a "more standard" way to do this. We have a standard way for
the board model to say "we don't know whether there might
be existing guest code out there that relies on being able
to make accesses to addresses where there should be a device
but we haven't modeled it". That way is to set the
ignore_memory_transaction_failures flag.

There are two things we can do:

(1) We can leave the ignore_memory_transaction_failures
flag set. This is safe (no behaviour change) but not the
right (matching the hardware) behaviour. The main reason
to do this is if we don't feel we have enough access to
a range of guest code to test the other approach.

(2) We can clear the flag. This is preferable (it matches the
hardware). But the requirement to do this is that
 (a) we must make the best effort we can to be sure we've
     put unimplemented-device placeholders for specific
     devices we don't yet model (by checking e.g. the
     hardware documentation for the SoC and board model,
     the device tree, etc)
 (b) we do the most wide-ranging testing of guest code that
     we can. This checks that we didn't miss anything in (a).

I don't mind which of these we do. What I was asking in my
comments on version one of your patch was for how we were
doing on requirement 2b.

thanks
