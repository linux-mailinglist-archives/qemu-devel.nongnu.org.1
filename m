This v2 series is follow up work of [1],[2].

The initial purpose is to track CPUID_HT in env->features[] for x86.
It's supposed to be implemented in x86_cpu_realizefn() and before
qemu_init_vcpu(). However, CPUID_HT bit needs to be evaluated based on
topology information, either 1) nr_cores and nr_threads of CPUState or
2) MachineState::smp.

1) are initialized in qemu_init_vcpu() which is too late. So [1] was
sent to initialize nr_threads and nr_cores of CPUState earlier. It
touches all the ARCHes and people disliked it. Followup attempt to
initialize them in cpu_common_initfn() was also rejected. [3]

2) needs to grab MachineState in cpu context and was disagreed[3]

As suggested by Igor[3], aduit nr_threads and nr_cores and initialize
them in pre_plug() callback for the ARCHes where they are actually needed.
I found nr_cores is only used by x86 and nr_threads is used by
X86/MIPS/PPC[4]. I didn't play with MIPS and PPC before and I'm
incapable to write patch for them. So I send an RFC work [2], which
drops nr_cores from CPUState and it instead maintains a substitute for
x86 only. The RFC work left how to handle nr_threads as open however I
didn't get any feedback yet.

Eventually, I decided to fix x86 only. The sulution is to maintain a
X86CPUTopoInfo in CPUX86State, so that x86 doesn't need to use
nr_threads and nr_cores anymore and the dependency on qemu_init_vcpu()
goes away.

x86 is the only user of CPUState::nr_core currently. When it switches to
use CPUX86state::X86CPUTopoInfo, CPUState::nr_core loses its only user
and can be dropped in patch 8.

In the future, if MIPS and PPC starts to maintain nr_threads in its own
CPU state, common CPUState::nr_threads can be dropped as well.

Besides the patches to fulfill the main goal to track CPUID_HT in
env->features[] for x86. This series also contains the cleanup patches
during the work.
