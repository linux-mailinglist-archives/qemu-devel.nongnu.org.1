I'll drop the last paragraph. I guess that (11) were here to document a hack on the
original design:
	"supported source_id values should be assigned here".

The new code doesn't do any assumptions like that. All it needs is that the caller
need to specify the notification type (currently, SEA or GPIO).

So, IMO the only thing eventually useful there is:

	(11) kvm_arch_on_sigbus_vcpu() report RAS errors via a SEA notifications,
	     when a SIGBUS event is triggered.  

Yet, to be frank, I'm not sure if this should be documented. So perhaps
the entire section (11) can be dropped.

Thanks,
Mauro
