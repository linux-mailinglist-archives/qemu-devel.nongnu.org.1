32-bit host support removal is irrelevant. We still fully support 32-bit
guests, and they can use KVM. It is upto the user to disable the LM CPU
flag if they wish to, though it shouldn't matter because if the OS running
on isapc is that old it'll not even look for the "LM" flag to begin with,
and so the CPU will never get switchd into 64-bit mode. 

Note, a run of ./configure' with TCG disabled only is NOT claiming to be
providing a minimal virtualization build. It is simply discarding TCG.

If people want a minimal build, they're expected to customize the
KConfig files to suit their needs.

With regards,
Daniel
