We've previously bumped up the timeouts in the netdev-socket qtest
to supposedly fix non-deterministic failures, however, the failures
are still hitting CI.

A simple 'listen()' and 'connect()' pairing across 2 QEMU processes
should be very quick to execute, even under high system load, so it
was never likely that the test was failing due to timeouts being
reached.

The actual root cause was a race condition in the test design. It
was spawning a QEMU with a 'server' netdev, and then spawning one
with the 'client' netdev. There was insufficient synchronization,
however, so it was possible for the 2nd QEMU process to attempt
to 'connect()' before the 'listen()' call was made by the 1st QEMU.

In the test scenarios that did not use the 'reconnect' flag, this
would result in the client QEMU never getting into the expected
state. The test code would thus loop on 'info network' until
hitting the maximum wait time.

This series reverts the increased timeouts, and fixes synchronization
in the test scenarios. It also improves reporting of errors in the
socket netdev backend so that 'info network' reports what actually
went wrong rather than a useless generic 'connection error' string.
This will help us diagnose any future CI problems, should they occurr.
