So you decided to "sometimes" take mr->refcount because it needs to, then
"sometimes" don't take mr->refcounts because it doesn't need to..

Normally such complexity is ok, but to me it's ok only when it services,
for example, a major performance improvements, so that it's justified to
add complexity.  The pay is done whoever going to maintain this code.

In this case, no, I don't yet see how important this idea is yet to
introduce such difference into mr refcounts, which is already complicated
as hell..  We're paying such complexity with some "technical cleanest",
while when with different treatment of mr->refcount in different context,
it isn't that clean either.

I hope that's obvious goal since start, yes, that patch will make
finalize() in any order works for MRs under the same owner, as I don't know
why that order matters.. taking that chance of almost still sticking with
one refcount.

I suppose you finally need to answer my above question [1] to say whether
it makes sense.  To me, it doesn't make sense only if there's a functional
difference on that order of finalize().

It's not only about efficiency, that's pretty much side effect.

It's more about how we should define refcount in the future, then if we
stick with owner sharing lifetime with all MRs then taking that subregion
refcount doesn't help anything except introducing a circular reference.  It
solves the circular reference with even a good side effect of reducing one
atomic op from that pov, even if in a slow path.

We discussed plenty in this area, obviously you don't care about keep
having two refcounts on MRs but I do my best to avoid it.. that's all about
it so far..

> Reference counters are tools specifically designed for this.

I hope I was trying to help.  We could wait for a 2nd opinion.
