I guess the *afr* regs fell into the cracks because they were not in the
isar struct -- makes sense to move them.

(This reg "must be interpreted with" MIDR_EL1; I'm wondering if that has
any implications once we enlighten guests with possible midr/revidr/aidr
values.)

I don't think it hurts to include them, it makes things easier when we
want to deal with non-zero values in there via kvm.

Hm, IIUC, kvm gets the correct CCSIDR_EL1 under the covers already
(i.e. no array).

Currently, kvm handles this as undef.

(I think the whole cache stuff might be a bit of a headache.)

Undef in kvm.

That one's another bit of a headache (I didn't manage to spot kvm code
dealing with it.)

I'll move the *afr* ones, not yet quite sure how to deal with the cache
related ones.
