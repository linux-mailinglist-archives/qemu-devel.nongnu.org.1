I thought we can use the same code path to process "aux ramblock" and all
kinds of other RAM_SHARED ramblocks.  IIUC cpr find/save should apply there
too, but maybe I missed something.

I was not closely followed all the discussions happened.. so I could have
missed something indeed.

One thing I want to double check is cpr will still make things like below
work, right?

  -object memory-backend-ram,share=on [1]

IIUC with the old code this won't create fd, so to make cpr work (and also
what I was trying to say in the previous email..) is we could silently
start to create memfds for these, which means we need to first teach
qemu_anon_ram_alloc() on creating memfd for RAM_SHARED and cache these fds
(which should hopefully keep the same behavior as before).

Then for aux ramblocks like ROMs, as long as it sets RAM_SHARED properly in
qemu_ram_alloc_internal() (but only when aux-share-mem=on, for sure..),
then the rest code path in ram_block_add() should be the same as when user
specified share=on in [1].

Anyway, if both of you agreed on it, I am happy to wait and read the whole
patch.

Side note: I'll still use a few days for other things, but I'll get back to
read this whole series before next week.. btw, this series does not depend
on precreate phase now, am I right?
