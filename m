I believe we have similar things already, like USO, which relies on the
kernel feature set that QEMU runs on.  What we do right now, afaiu, is we
make it a per-device property ON/OFF.  Then when unknown remote information
is required, we make it ON/OFF/AUTO.  When it's AUTO, it may prefer ON and
probe the kernel, dynamically decide the value on realize.

I didn't check the code if it's explicitly done like that, but I think
that's doable at least when a backend relies on such remote information.

IIUC, it is a proposal of using exclude-list, which should in most cases be
empty.

Yes, I agree it's at least better than query all the devices and having
mgmt specify each backend to enable backend-transfer.

However IIUC it also means the query API will be internal, so that
migration will need to be able to query that from device.

Then we have similar issue on what happens if we migrate from a new QEMU to
an old QEMU, that new QEMU (when migration module queries TAP) reports
per-device ON, however it won't actually work because dest QEMU is OFF.
IOW, we're still missing the functionality that we leverage from machine
type properties..

Or if we make the query to be visible to QMP / mgmt, then it'll at least
need to be a include-list, not exclude-list.

Then, we're literally bypassing the machine type versioning mechanism,
offloading all these to mgmt.

It should work, which I agree. But it also means we're reinventing the
wheel of what machine type properties were designed for... because if we
expose all these caps on all devices (as long as mutable after device
realize), we do not need machine type properties anymore.  They're
fundamentally solving the same problem, IMHO, on providing a working value
for migration no matter what the dest QEMU binary is.

Thanks,
