The existing commands (query-cpu-definitions, query-cpu-model-expansion)
are useful for probing before starting a domain. But what we use qom-get
for is to get a view of the currently instantiated virtual CPU created
by QEMU according to -cpu when we're starting a domain. In other words,
we start QEMU with -S and before starting vCPUs we need to know exactly
what features were enabled and if any feature we requested was disabled
by QEMU. Currently we query QOM for CPU properties as that's what we
were advised to use ages ago.

The reason behind querying such info is ensuring stable guest ABI during
migration. Asking QEMU for a specific CPU model and features does not
mean we'll get exactly what we asked for (this is not a bug) so we need
to record the differences so that we can start QEMU for incoming
migration with a CPU matching exactly the one provided on the source.

As Peter said, the current way is terribly inefficient as it requires
several hundreds of QMP commands so the goal is to have a single QMP
command that would tell us all we need to know about the virtual CPU.
That is all enabled features and all features that could not be enabled
even though we asked for them.
