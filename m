All what you stated sounds correct to me and explains 2). But there is 
still no reasoning for 1).

It will be a good reasoning if we can show propagating post_save() 
errors is easier (or more important) than propagating proceeding errors.

There are alternative options. "Making sure that no error will happen 
when there is a proceeding error by having two callbacks" is one of 
them. You wrote:

But it may not be mandatory. In fact, I searched "post_save" in the code 
base and found all implementations are for cleanup and always succeeds, 
which makes sense; most (if not all) cleanup operations like g_free() 
always succeeds in general.

So perhaps "making sure that no error will happen when there is a 
proceeding error" may be feasible, and it may not even require two 
callbacks because post_save() always succeeds.
