Yes, we want to former. But as Thomas pointed out, last time
someone showed up, and while the maintainers weren't willing to
keep 32-on-32 [*], they kept maintaining it at the price of restricting
XX-on-64.

[*] back then we proved system emulation XX-on-32 wasn't really useful
anymore, and user emulation 64-on-32 was partly broken, so only
32-on-32 user emulation was functional.
