Rather than using non-constant argv[0] Pierrick suggested to add a
single CLI option '-target' which selects the corresponding TargetInfo
structure to use at runtime. I.e. for ARM:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20250424222112.36194-12-philmd@linaro.org/

For distros qemu-system-arm could be a shell script prepending
'-target arm' while passing the arguments calling qemu-system.

If a distro wants to name a binary 'qemu-kvm' it can drop the
-target option and hard-wire its target_info() to a distro-specific
TargetInfo implementation, or &target_info_x86_64_system.
