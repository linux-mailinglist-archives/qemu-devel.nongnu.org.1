I guess it will be possible for QEMU to actually set something different
=66rom what we tell it to do (for example dependency of a specific
settings on something else which was not set, etc)? If so, we indeed
need both (a) and (b).

I guess so. Originally for x86_64 we got a dump of CPUID data, but that
changed when some features started to be described by MSRs.

Each arch has some specifics in CPU configuration and the way we talk
with QEMU about it. So having the same QMP interface is not a
requirement. It depends how well the existing interface maps to details
that need to be expressed. That said a common interface is better if it
makes sense.
