That + some additional information I think.

That's a philosophy question for the ARM architects :)

The registers focus on correctness (so what you need to flush etc,
where the point of coherence is and other fun)
not all the info needed for performance tuning. There is some stuff
on the cache type that I guess is more perf tuning related (sets etc)


They probably could have expanded the CPU registers to provide a lot
more information (which is what x86 effectively does). IIRC what is
there today for ARM is pretty much useless for anything placement
decision related (scheduling etc)  You can't tell what shares a cache
(or more fun cluster topology structures). 

It is hard in registers to define a nice flexible graph where
all sorts of fun topology of the system can be described.
PPTT provides that opportunity for a richer description.
Sure you could squirt out the equivalent table via registers,
but what's the point given we have firmware tables for this
sort of thing..
