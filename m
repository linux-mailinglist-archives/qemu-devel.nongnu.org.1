The QMP facility looks to be all present, which is migrate-cancel and
migrate-pause mentioned above.

For migrate_cancel (of precopy), is that Ctrl-C of "virsh migrate"?

Does libvirt exposes migrate_pause via any virsh command?  IIUC that's the
only official way of pausing a postcopy VM on either side.  I also agree we
shouldn't make yank the official tool to use.

OTOH, the default timeouts work without changing libvirt, making sure the
customers will not be stuck in a likely-failing network for hours without
providing a way to properly detach and recover when it's wanted.
