Having performance tests would be a great addition to the QEMU test 
suite, whether it's for the single binary or any other change.

Concerning the single binary, we have no plan to modify ppc target code 
for now. As well, most of other architecture already handle 32 vs 64bits 
and endianness with runtime paths, and it has not been a problem so far.

I still think it's better to write proper code and eventually optimize 
parts identified by proper profiling. But impacting architecture and use 
preprocessor heavily before any proof that is needed has been found is 
premature optimization IMHO.

Pierrick
