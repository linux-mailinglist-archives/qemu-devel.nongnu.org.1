I'll say again that the download *must* be handled separately from the test with timeout. 
This is an absolute show-stopper.

I've tried this twice now, from a decently fast connection in central Brisbane, and have 
had multiple downloads be canceled by the timeout.  Since the download isn't clever enough 
to pick up where it left off, it will never succeed.
