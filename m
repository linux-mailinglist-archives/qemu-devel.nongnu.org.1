As I heard from Peter, there a future plans to create such channel

Yes "query + get intersection + set the list" works good for me.
That's enough abstract, the management app should not even care
what these IDs are.

And if migration-handshake realized, that (as many other
paraameters) may be simplified. We may finally have

    backend-transfer = "off" | "auto" | [list of IDs]

, where "auto" means exactly negotiate with target the maximal set
of devices, for which we can do backend-transfer.
