And if that is a real difference, I'd think whether we should simply make
migrate_cancel be oob-capable too.. IOW, I still think it'll be good to
stick with always one API to cancel a migration, no matter which it is.  If
we want to move over to yank then I think we should move all migrate_cancel
operations into yank and deprecate "migrate_cancel', but that sounds
overkill.

There's only one thing that might not be oob-compatible there so far, which
is bdrv_activate_all().  But I plan to remove it very soon (so that disks
will be activated in the migration thread instead, just like failure cases).
