I introduced a vfio_devices_all_viommu_preset() routine to check all devices
in a container and a simplified version of vfio_viommu_get_max_iova()
returning the space max_iova.

Yes. So, I did a little more change to improve vfio_dirty_tracking_init().

That's fine.

I am trying to sort out which patches could be merged in advance for QEMU 9.1
and your series has shrunk a lot since it was last sent. I might resend the
whole to cherry pick the simple changes and get some R-b tags.
