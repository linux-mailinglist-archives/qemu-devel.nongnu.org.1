That's the following semantics:

   # Note that if you issue 'block-job-cancel' after 'drive-mirror' has
   # indicated (via the event BLOCK_JOB_READY) that the source and
   # destination are synchronized, then the event triggered by this
   # command changes to BLOCK_JOB_COMPLETED, to indicate that the
   # mirroring has ended and the destination now has a point-in-time copy
   # tied to the time of the cancellation.

Hmm. Looking at this, it looks for me, that should probably a 'block-job-complete" command (as leading to BLOCK_JOB_COMPLETED).

Actually, what is the difference between block-job-complete and block-job-cancel(force=false) for mirror in ready state?

I only see the following differencies:

1. block-job-complete documents that it completes the job synchronously.. But looking at mirror code I see it just set s->should_complete = true, which will be then handled asynchronously.. So I doubt that documentation is correct.

2. block-job-complete will trigger final graph changes. block-job-cancel will not.

Is [2] really useful? Seems yes: in case of some failure before starting migration target, we'd like to continue executing source. So, no reason to break block-graph in source, better keep it unchanged.

But I think, such behavior better be setup by mirror-job start parameter, rather then by special option for cancel (or even compelete) command, useful only for mirror.

So, what about the following substitution for block-job-cancel:

block-job-cancel(force=true)  -->  use job-cancel

block-job-cancel(force=false) for backup, stream, commit  -->  use job-cancel

block-job-cancel(force=false) for mirror in ready mode  -->

   instead, use block-job-complete. If you don't need final graph modification which mirror job normally does, use graph-change=false parameter for blockdev-mirror command.


(I can hardly remember, that we've already discussed something like this long time ago, but I don't remember the results)

I also a bit unsure about active commit soft-cancelling semantics. Is it actually useful? If yes, block-commit command will need similar option.
