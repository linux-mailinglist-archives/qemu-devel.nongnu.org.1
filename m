The policy is intentionally based on an honour code, because trust in
contributors intention is a fundamental foundation of a well functioning
OSS project. When projects start to view contributors as untrustworthy,
then IME they end up with burdensome processes (often pushed by corporate
demands), such as copyright assignment / CLA, instead of the lightweight
DCO (self-certification, honour based) process we have today.

The policy never intended for the project or our maintainers to take any
active steps to identify and block AI contributions from contributors
with ill-intent. That would be a sisyphean task IMHO.

We're in a situation where many organizations are strongly pushing their
employees to use AI tools where possible. In the absence of any written
policy, a project has effectively created an implicit policy that they
are willing to accept AI contributions.

Contributors have few sources of information on implications of AI in the
context of OSS projects, which are not written by companies with a vested
(biased) interest in maximising use of AI.

So the QEMU policy serves several purposes IMHO:

  * Provides an interpretation of the DCO wrt LLM generated content
    that reflects community rather than corporate viewpoint

  * Provide cover to the project itself by stating our intent wrt
    what we are willing to accept, pushing liability to the
    contributor (as is the case with DCO in general)

  * Gives contributors clear guidance on whether or not they can
    submit AI generated content to QEMU

  * Gives contributors a policy to point their employer to when
    asked why they didn't use any AI tools in context of QEMU

I find this to be a somewhat distastful view of our contributors, as it
is giving a strong implication that they are likely to act dishonestly
wrt our contribution policies. I don't think that is a fair reflection
of our contributors in general.

I'll never say never, as it is quite possible for any community to have
a malicious contributor, and someone may well do this just out of spite
to try and prove our policy "wrong" because of the high profile of this
policy.

I don't think we should design our contribution policies around the worst
of people though. Policies are a social contract and there is little we
can do to force compliance against a motivated person with ill-intent.

If we ever did identify someone willfully ignoring the policies (whether
on AI, or any other aspect), our main recourse is limited to no longer
accepting their work / participation in the project.

With regards,
Daniel
