Hmm. Looking through my draft, and in parallel, moving char-socket vmsd
into correct layer (into char-socket), I now see the following:

1. splitting open() logic into init() and connect() make sense only
if it done for and together with implementing vmsd for that chardev
(as we do the split exactly in a manner which makes implementing of
migration possible)

2. implementing backend-transfer for all chardevs is too much for me.

So, seems, correct way is to allow chardevs have only .init, without
.connect when no support for migration.

And, converting all chardevs would be simply rename .open() to .init().
And I'll keep .open() semantics for .init() (i.e. additional handling
.filename and CHR_EVENT_OPENED for chardevs that don't care of it)

So, I can do the rename as first patch of v7 of this series, and we'll
keep common interaface for all chadevs (except for that most of them
will not support migration, and therefore don't implement .connect()
and .vmsd)
