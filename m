Thanks Paolo for considering that.

My steps to reproduce seemed really clear and are 100% reproducible
for me, but no one so far said "yeah they see it too", so I'm getting
unsure if it was not tried by anyone else or if there is more to it
than we yet know.
Further I tested more with the commit reverted, and found that at
least cross version migrations (9.2 -> 10.1) still have issues that
seem related - complaining about pdcm as missing feature.
But that was in a log of a test system that went away and ... you know
how these things can sometimes be, that new result is not yet very
reliable.

I intended to check the following matrix more deeply again with and
without the reverted change and then come back to this thread:

#1 Compare platforms
- Migrating between non containerized hosts to verify if they are
affected as well
- Power management explicitly switched off/on (vs the auto detect of
host-model) in the guest XML
#2 Retest the different Use-cases I've seen this pop up
- 10.1 managed save (broken unless reverting the commit that was identified=
)
- 9.2 -> 10.1 migration (seems broken even with the revert)

The hope was that these will help to further identify what is going
on, but despite the urgency of the release being imminent I have not
yet managed to find the time in the last two days :-/
