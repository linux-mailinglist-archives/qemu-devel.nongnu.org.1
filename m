Looking at flatview_write_continue I see no early exit, so maybe it 
would still try to get through everything and work as we are hoping,
but that's why I'd like to write a test for it.
I'm just not sure if it should be a unit test or a QTest and
what examples I could look to copy.

Tbh I'm not sure whether I understand the intricacies of this code well 
enough to write such a patch without significant guidance.

I don't understand what you mean by this
Do you mean keeping the current patch or going back to v1 or a different 
third approach?
