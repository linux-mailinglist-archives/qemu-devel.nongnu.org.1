Good to know the progress.

If that doesn't take a lot of time to provide a formal patch, IMO you
should go for it at least with an RFC; RFC is less likely to be completely
forgotten from thread discussions in all cases.

Migration is not the only one using tls channels, so even if migration can
avoid depending on it, I wonder if gnutls_bye is a must if we want to make
sure QEMU is free from pre-mature termination attacks on other users.
