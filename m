For the iotest's use-case, that only works for background mode. I'll
explain below.

Agreed.

The iotest creates a new target image for each incremental sync which
only records the diff relative to the previous mirror and those diff
images are later rebased onto each other to get the full picture.

Thus, it can be that a previous mirror job (not just background process
or previous write) already copied a cluster, and in particular, copied
it to a different target!

Because the diff image is new, the target's cluster is not necessarily
allocated. When using write-blocking and a write of, e.g., 9 bytes to a
clear source cluster comes in, only those 9 bytes are written to the
target. Now the target's cluster is allocated but with only those 9
bytes of data. When rebasing, the previously copied cluster is "masked"
and when reading the rebased image, we only see the cluster with those 9
bytes (and IIRC, zeroes for the rest of the cluster rather than the
previously copied data).

We do need to copy new writes to any cluster, and with a clear cluster
and write-blocking, the issue can manifest.
