+======================================
+IBM's Flexible Service Interface (FSI)
+======================================
+
+The QEMU FSI emulation implements hardware interfaces between ASPEED SOC, FSI
+master/slave and the end engine.
+
+FSI is a point-to-point two wire interface which is capable of supporting
+distances of up to 4 meters. FSI interfaces have been used successfully for
+many years in IBM servers to attach IBM Flexible Support Processors(FSP) to
+CPUs and IBM ASICs.
+
+FSI allows a service processor access to the internal buses of a host POWER
+processor to perform configuration or debugging. FSI has long existed in POWER
+processes and so comes with some baggage, including how it has been integrated
+into the ASPEED SoC.
+
+Working backwards from the POWER processor, the fundamental pieces of interest
+for the implementation are: (see the `FSI specification`_ for more details)
+
+1. The Common FRU Access Macro (CFAM), an address space containing various
+   "engines" that drive accesses on buses internal and external to the POWER
+   chip. Examples include the SBEFIFO and I2C masters. The engines hang off of
+   an internal Local Bus (LBUS) which is described by the CFAM configuration
+   block.
+
+2. The FSI slave: The slave is the terminal point of the FSI bus for FSI
+   symbols addressed to it. Slaves can be cascaded off of one another. The
+   slave's configuration registers appear in address space of the CFAM to
+   which it is attached.
+
+3. The FSI master: A controller in the platform service processor (e.g. BMC)
+   driving CFAM engine accesses into the POWER chip. At the hardware level
+   FSI is a bit-based protocol supporting synchronous and DMA-driven accesses
+   of engines in a CFAM.
+
+4. The On-Chip Peripheral Bus (OPB): A low-speed bus typically found in POWER
+   processors. This now makes an appearance in the ASPEED SoC due to tight
+   integration of the FSI master IP with the OPB, mainly the existence of an
+   MMIO-mapping of the CFAM address straight onto a sub-region of the OPB
+   address space.
+
+5. An APB-to-OPB bridge enabling access to the OPB from the ARM core in the
+   AST2600. Hardware limitations prevent the OPB from being directly mapped
+   into APB, so all accesses are indirect through the bridge.
+
+The LBUS is modelled to maintain the qdev bus hierarchy and to take advantages
+of the object model to automatically generate the CFAM configuration block.
+The configuration block presents engines in the order they are attached to the
+CFAM's LBUS. Engine implementations should subclass the LBusDevice and set the
+'config' member of LBusDeviceClass to match the engine's type.
+
+CFAM designs offer a lot of flexibility, for instance it is possible for a
+CFAM to be simultaneously driven from multiple FSI links. The modeling is not
+so complete; it's assumed that each CFAM is attached to a single FSI slave (as
+a consequence the CFAM subclasses the FSI slave).
+
+As for FSI, its symbols and wire-protocol are not modelled at all. This is not
+necessary to get FSI off the ground thanks to the mapping of the CFAM address
+space onto the OPB address space - the models follow this directly and map the
+CFAM memory region into the OPB's memory region.
+
+The following commands start the ``rainier-bmc`` machine with built-in FSI
+model. There are no model specific arguments. Please check this document to
+learn more about Aspeed ``rainier-bmc`` machine: (:doc:`../../system/arm/aspeed`)
