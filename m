Yes, thanks.  I went over quite a few follow up patches but I missed this
one.  IMHO you can also split the only fix out, so that can be better
looked at by vfio-user developers.  It'll also be easier for them to verify
if they want.

Do you have a rough answer of above question [1], on what might suffer from
lost MRs?  I sincerely want to know how much we are missing after we could
already auto-detach owner-shared MRs.

From a quick glance, at least patch 4-14 are detaching MRs that shares the
same owner.  IIUC, it means at least patch 4-14 do not rely on patch 2.

Then I wonder how much patch 2 helps in real life.

There's indeed a difference though when a qdev may realize(), unrealize()
and realize() in a sequence, in which case patch 2 could help whil commit
ac7a892fd3 won't, however I don't know whether there's real use case,
either.

I also wished if there's such device, it'll have explicit detach code so
that when I debug a problem on the device I can easily see when the MRs
will be available, instead of remembering all the rules when something in
some layer will auto-detach...

Personally I think such automation adds burden to developers' mind if
there're still a bunch of MRs that are not used in this way (there
definitely are, otherwise we should be able to completely unexport
memory_region_del_subregion). But that's subjective; I believe at least
Paolo agrees with your general approach.

Thanks,
