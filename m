This is a little off-topic:

So I wanted to make libvirt use the new parameter to stay ahead
deprecation. I've applied this patch to qemu, dumped capabilities and
pretty much expected a bunch of test cases in libvirt fail as they'd be
using a deprecated field as libvirt is supposed to validate everything.

And the test suite passed unexpectedly. I've dug further and noticed
that for some reason libvirt doesn't still use JSON parameters for
-chardev (which is the pre-requisite for validation).

I've also noticed that at some point I attempted to convert it over
witnessed by having an (unused) capability named QEMU_CAPS_CHARDEV_JSON
that I've introduced.

My questions are:
1) Does '-chardev' accept JSON identical to 'chardev-add' QMP command?

If yes:
2) Since when can that be used? (What can I use as a witness)
3) Are there any gotchas?

I wonder this as I'd love to finish that out, but I really don't fancy
digging into qemu to find a gotcha 3/4 of the way there.

Anyways, as I've already stated, this patch is okay for libvirt, but I
didn't review the implementation, thus, on behalf of libvirt:
