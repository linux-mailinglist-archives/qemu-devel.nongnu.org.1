In review of v1, I inquired about the locking, and Mike explained it
some more.  I wonder whether we should work some of that into our
documentation.

Is this referring to the "Guest Hypervisor Communication Block (GHCB)
Standardization" mentioned in the commit message?

That's 70 pages...  Where exactly is the file format specified?

    For legibility, wrap text paragraphs so every line is at most 70
    characters long.

    Separate sentences with two spaces.
