Not sure it you've noticed the 3 spaces before the 0 replacing 0x0 that 
would keep alignment. But it's not something that needs to be changed just 
commented on it as it came up but I don't expect it to be done now on the 
day of the freeze. It's more important to get the already reviewed and 
queued patches in a pull request to not miss the release. So this comment 
is just for the fuuture.
