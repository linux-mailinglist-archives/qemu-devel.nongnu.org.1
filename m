For cloud use-case, host side is likely in a better position
to accomplish the task of saving power by migrating VM to
another socket/host to compact idle load. (I've found at least 1
kubernetis tool[1], which does energy monitoring). Perhaps there
are schedulers out there that do that using its data.

Perhaps adding one or several energy sensors (ex: some i2c ones),
would let us provide auxiliary threads consumption to guest, and
even make it more granular if necessary (incl. vhost user/out of
process device models or pass-through devices if they have PMU).
It would be better than further muddling vCPUs consumption
estimates with something that doesn't belong there.

=46rom what I've read, process energy usage done via RAPL is not
exactly accurate. But there are monitoring tools out there that
use RAPL and other sources to make energy consumption monitoring
more reliable.

Reinventing that wheel and pulling all of the nuances of process
power monitoring inside of QEMU process, needlessly complicates it.
Maybe we should reuse one of existing tools and channel its data
through appropriate QEMU channels (RAPL/emulated PMU counters/...).

Implementing RAPL in pure form though looks fine to me,
so the same tools could use it the same way as on the host
if needed without VM specific quirks.
