I wasn't talking about the driver in this context - I'm questioning whether
there is any reasonable interpretation where hardware should be considered
to support interrupter mapping when it is configured to use pin-based
interrupts.

Unfortunately, this is an ambiguous wording - "it" could refer to either
the interrupt or the interrupter, and I suspect it is talking about the IE
flag. The IE flag is called "Interrupt Enable," not "InterruptER Enable."
(If it's off, you can still use the Event Ring in polling mode - the
interruptER includes the event ring, the flag only applies to interrupt
delivery.) On the other hand, there is an "InterruptER Enable" (INTE) flag
in the USBCMD register - but there's only one, which covers all the
interrupters available.

On the other hand, in 4.2 it says "Enable the Interrupter by writing a '1'
to the Interrupt Enable (IE) field=E2=80=A6".

So the terminology is not consistent.

What does disabling the Interrupter (again, not the interrupt) mean? The
Event Ring is part of the Interrupter. So if the interrupter is disabled,
is the ring disabled? If the ring is disabled, should the hardware really
be dispatching events to it?

It's certainly a possibility - but it adds user-facing complexity for no
discernible gain. Users of non-macOS guests won't care which way the flag
is set because it doesn't affect them, and the default setting won't work
for macOS guest users, meaning they need to research what's going on if
they're hit by the problem. OK, we can enable it by default for the vmapple
machine type, and most users of x86-64 macOS guests will be using the Q35
machine type, where MSI-X is functional. I'm just not convinced the higher
complexity(*) is worth a user setting that no user will ever change.

(* And it WILL be higher complexity, because you definitely need to insert
the condition in xhci_event(). This isn't fixable with just a tweak in
xhci_pci_intr_raise, say - the HCI needs to behave as if interrupter
mapping was unsupported, or it won't work.)

It's not as simple as redirecting xhci_pci_intr_raise for n !=3D 0 to still
trigger the pin-based interrupt when MSI(-X) is disabled with macOS guests.
For one, pin-based interrupts are level-triggered, so you have to cheat
with the IMAN_IP state. Even then though, the macOS guest will only process
event rings for which it received an interrupt, which makes some sense, as
there's no point having multiple rings if you're going to check all of them
when you receive an interrupt for only one of them.

While the proposed behavior violates the specification, it is still <br>

It&#39;s certainly a possibility - but it adds user-facing complexity for n=

flag is set because it doesn&#39;t affect them, and the default setting won=
&#39;t work for macOS guest users, meaning they need to research what&#39;s=
 going on if they&#39;re hit by the problem. OK, we can enable it by defaul=
t for the vmapple machine type, and most users of x86-64 macOS guests will =

&gt; I&#39;ve been chasing this problem for a while, and I&#39;ve finally f=
igured<br>
&gt; out the cause, and I think an acceptable solution. I&#39;ve explained =
the<br>
&gt; problem and quoted the relevant sections of the XHCI spec in more<br>
&gt; detail in the linked GitLab issue:<br>
&gt; <br>

&gt; <br>
&gt; The fix provided is I think the simplest one in terms of lines of code=
,<br>
&gt; but it&#39;s also a little ugly, as we&#39;re constantly checking msix=
_enabled<br>
&gt; and msi_enabled via a callback function. Granted, we&#39;re already do=
ing<br>
&gt; that in xhci_pci_intr_raise and xhci_pci_intr_update, but this adds<br=
>
&gt; a bunch more calls.<br>
<br>
The fact that macOS rejects xHC with numintrs &lt; 4 implies macOS still <b=
r>
expects multiple Interrupters are enabled, but all Interrupters assert <br>
the INTx# pin. Implementation of such a behavior will be contained in <br>
xhci_pci_intr_raise() so we can save an indirection call of <br>
intr_mapping_supported() as a bonus.<br></blockquote><div><br></div><div>It=
&#39;s not as simple as redirecting xhci_pci_intr_raise for n !=3D 0 to sti=
ll trigger the pin-based interrupt when MSI(-X) is disabled with macOS gues=
ts. For one, pin-based interrupts are level-triggered, so you have to cheat=
 with the IMAN_IP state. Even then though, the macOS guest will only proces=
s event rings for which it received an interrupt, which makes some sense, a=
s there&#39;s no point having multiple rings if you&#39;re going to check a=
ll of them when you receive an interrupt for only one of them.<br></div><di=

&gt; The main alternative I can see is to &quot;push&quot; the state of whe=
ther<br>
&gt; interrupter mapping is supported: provide a custom config_write<br>
&gt; implementation for the PCI device, and every time the configuration<br=

&gt; area is updated, evaluate whether or not this means that MSI or MSI-X<=
br>
&gt; are enabled and update a corresponding flag inside XHCIState. We could=
<br>
&gt; even use this opportunity to switch out different .intr_raise and<br>
&gt; .intr_update functions depending on which interrupt delivery mechanism=
<br>
&gt; is active in the PCI device.<br>
