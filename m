Currently, QEMU supports emulating either stage-1 or stage-2 SMMUs
but not nested instances.
This patch series adds support for nested translation in SMMUv3,
this is controlled by property =E2=80=9Carm-smmuv3.stage=3Dnested=E2=80=9D,=
 and
advertised to guests as (IDR0.S1P =3D=3D 1 && IDR0.S2P =3D=3D 2)

Main changes(architecture):
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D
1) CDs are considered IPA and translated with stage-2.
2) TTBx and tables for stage-1 are considered IPA and translated
   with stage-2.
3) Translate the IPA address with stage-2.

TLBs:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
TLBs are the most tricky part.

1) General design
   Unified(Combined) design is used, where entries with ASID=3D-1 are
   IPAs(cached from stage-2 config)

   TLBs are also modified to cache 2 permissions, a new permission added
   "parent_perm."

   For non-nested configuration, perm =3D=3D parent_perm and nothing
   changes. This is used to know which stage to use in case there is
   a permission fault from a TLB entry.

2) Caching in TLB
   Stage-1 and stage-2 are inserted in the TLB as is.
   For nested translation, both entries are combined into one TLB
   entry. The size (level and granule) are chosen from the smallest entries=
.
   That means that a stage-1 translation can be cached with sage-2
   granule in key, this is take into account lookup.

3) TLB Lookup
   TLB lookup already uses ASID in key, so it can distinguish between
   stage-1 and stage-2.
   And as mentioned above, the granule for stage-1 can be different,
   If stage-1 lookup failed, we try again with the stage-2 granule.

4) TLB invalidation
   - Address invalidation is split, for IOVA(CMD_TLBI_NH_VA
     /CMD_TLBI_NH_VAA) and IPA(CMD_TLBI_S2_IPA) based on ASID value
   - CMD_TLBI_NH_ASID/CMD_TLBI_NH_ALL: Consider VMID if stage-2 is
     supported, and invalidate stage-1 only by VMIDs

As far as I understand, this is compliant with the ARM architecture:
- ARM ARM DDI 0487J.a: RLGSCG, RTVTYQ, RGNJPZ
- ARM IHI 0070F.b: 16.2 Caching

An alternative approach would be to instantiate 2 TLBs, one per each
stage. I haven=E2=80=99t investigated that.

Others
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
- Advertise SMMUv3.2-S2FWB, it is NOP for QEMU as it doesn=E2=80=99t suppor=
t
  attributes.

- OAS: A typical setup with nesting is to share CPU stage-2 with the
  SMMU, and according to the user manual, SMMU OAS must match the
  system physical address.

  This was discussed before in
  https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230226220650.1480786-11-smostafa@google.com=
/
  The implementation here, follows the discussion, where migration is
  added and oas is set up from the board (virt). However, the OAS is
  chosen based on the CPU PARANGE as there is no fixed one.

- For nested configuration, IOVA notifier only notifies for stage-1
  invalidations (as far as I understand this is the intended
  behaviour as it notifies for IOVA)

- Stop ignoring VMID for stage-1 if stage-2 is also supported.


Future improvements:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
1) One small improvement, that I don=E2=80=99t think it=E2=80=99s worth the=
 extra
   complexity, is in case of Stage-1 TLB miss for nested translation,
   we can do stage-1 walk and lookup for stage-2 TLBs, instead of
   doing the full walk.

Testing
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
1) IOMMUFD + VFIO
   Kernel: https://lore.kernel.org/all/cover.1683688960.git.nicolinc@nvidia=
.com/
   VMM: https://qemu-devel.nongnu.narkive.com/o815DqpI/rfc-v5-0-8-arm-smmuv=
3-emulation-support

   By assigning =E2=80=9Cvirtio-net-pci,netdev=3Dnet0,disable-legacy=3Don,i=
ommu_platform=3Don,ats=3Don=E2=80=9D,
   to a guest VM (on top of QEMU guest) with VIFO and IOMMUFD.

2) Work in progress prototype I am hacking on for nesting on KVM
   (this is nowhere near complete, and misses many stuff but it
   doesn't require VMs/VFIO) also with virtio-net-pci and git
   cloning a bunch of stuff and also observing traces.

I also modified the Linux driver to test with mixed granules/levels.

ogle.com/
- Collected Eric Rbs
