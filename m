I tend to feel that having MigrationState exist for the whole lifetime
of QEMU is a bug, forced on us by the unfortunate need to call
migrate-set-parameters/capabilities separately from the migrate
command, and by the need to query migrate info an arbitrary amount of
time after it finishes.

This puts libvirt in the awkward position of having to manually reset
all migration parameters, just to ensure earlier settings don't
accidentally affect a future migration operation :-( This is a design
that encourages mistakes.

Rather than MigrationState become a singleton, I'd really encourage
trying to see if we can fix the lifecycle design problems, so that
we have a clear beginning & end of the migration operation, with the
state discarded at the end, such that every future migrate starts
from a clean base.


With regards,
Daniel
