I suspect the problem is that checkpatch.pl is an import from the Linux
source tree which has since had syncs with its upstream as well as a
slew of QEMU specific patches. If we don't care about tracking upstream
anymore we could bite the bullet and fix indentation going forward.

Of course arguably we should replace it with a python script and reduce
our dependence on perl. I'm sure someone had a go at that once but it
might have only been a partial undertaking.
