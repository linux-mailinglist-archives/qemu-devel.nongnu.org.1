I can disable plugins and do that normally but that does not help those 
who get QEMU from their distro (i.e. most users). If this infrastructure 
was disabled in default builds and needed an explicit option to enable 
then those who need it could enable it and not imposed it on everyone else 
who just get a default build from a distro and never use plugins. Having 
an option which needs rebuild is like not having the option for most 
people. I guess the question is which is the larger group? Those who just 
run guests or those who use this instrumentation with plugins. The default 
may better be what the larger group needs. Even then distros may still 
change the default so it would be best if the overhead can be minimised 
even if enabled. I think the log infrastructure does that, would a similar 
solution work here?

For testing I've found that because embedded PPC CPUs have a software 
controlled MMU (and in addition to that QEMU may flush TLB entries too 
often) running something that does a lot of memory access like runnung the 
STREAM benchmark on sam460ex is hit by this IIRC but anything else causing 
a lot of interrupts like reading from emulated disk or sound is probably 
affected as well. I've tried to optimise PPC exception handling a bit 
before but whenever I optimise something it is later undone by other 
changes not caring about performance.
