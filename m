Because it makes it easier to use distro Python. If distro Python is
<accepted, configure's will try to use the "installed" version. If that
version in turn is too new for distro Python, you're screwed. So you want
to be as conservative as needed for accepted, but not more.

Regarding fool or pioneer: for sure we're extraordinarily kind towards
distros. To some extent we have to do that because of 1) the possible
competition of other VMMs that completely ignore distros (e.g. because they
just use cargo)=E2=80=94packaging is an area where C still has an edge and =
we want
to keep that edge 2) we're an infrastructure component that can't just tell
users to grab a flatpak.

The distro policy (mostly conceived by Dan) has served us well, with only
small adjustments needed to have newish version of Meson/Rust(*), and
non-prehistoric versions of Python. I don't see a need to change it, since
at this point we have the tools needed to manage the complexity.

Paolo

(*) Most of the Rust issues would solve themselves by telling users of
Ubuntu 22.04 and Debian bookworm to install the upstream tool chain with
rustup instead of relying on distro rustc packages. Unlike Linux, which
uses unstable features, QEMU sticks to what's been stabilized and that
means newer releases sometimes.
