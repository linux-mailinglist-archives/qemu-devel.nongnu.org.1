Only the unit tests.

Yep

More generally, simply opening a LUKS volume can also impose a significant
delay because key validation is intentionally slow in wallclock time. So we
should get a minimum of 1 second delay, but if given an image created on a
significantly faster machine (or a malicious image), the larger 'iterations'
count could make us take way longer to open the image.

I guess that's a potential problem too ?

Amending the keys has the same performance penalty too as that involves
same intentionally slow crypto

So IIUC the 'open' operation is not in a coroutine, while the
'amend' operation is in a coroutine ?

IIUC the coroutine_mixed_fn is expanding to a no-op. What is the
actual functional fix needed to stop the crash ?
