Indeed. After discussing this more internally we have actually settled 
on one of the alternatives you have mentioned below.

This is the one we decided to go with. We simply added a new 
"reconnect-ms" option, which doesn't replace the old one for backwards 
compatibility, but also disallows both to be specified at the same time, 
making them mutually exclusive. I think deprecation would be the way to 
go here.

Sure, sounds great. Thanks!
