I started writing this script to be hosted outside qemu tree, when
we had a very different API.

I noticed later about the QMP, and even tried to write a patch for it,
but I gave up due to asyncio complexity...

Please notice that, on this file, I actually placed three classes:

- qmp
- util
- cper_guid

I could probably make the first one to be an override of QEMUMonitorProtoco=
l=20
(besides normal open/close/cmd communication, it also contains some
methods that are specific to error inject use case:

- to generate a CPER record;
- to search for data via qom-get.

The other two classes are just common code used by ghes_inject commands.
My idea is to have multiple commands to do different kinds of GHES
error injection, each command on a different file/class.

That sounds interesting! I give it a try.

Yeah, I saw that already. Doing:=20

	sys.path.append(path.join(qemu_dir, 'python'))

the same way qom-get does should do the trick.

Good to know, I'll try and see what fits best.

I'll take a look. The name "legacy" is a little scary, as it might
imply that this has been deprecated. If there's no plans to deprecate,
then it would be great to use it and simplify the code a little bit.

Yes, that's the case: a serialized sync send/response logic works perfectly
for this script. No need to be burden with asyncio complexity.

Thanks,
Mauro
