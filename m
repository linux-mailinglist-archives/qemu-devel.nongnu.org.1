You're right, that won't work, the memory needs to be mapped before it
can be used.
At minimum there should be some graceful failure, right now this will crash=

I'll do that, but also answer inline in the meantime since we should
perhaps change the approach.

Xen VM's that use QEMU's VirtIO have a QEMU instance running in a separate =
VM.

There's basically two mechanisms for QEMU's Virtio backends to access
the guest's RAM.
1. Foreign mappings. This gives the VM running QEMU access to the
entire RAM of the guest VM.
2. Grant mappings. This allows the guest to dynamically grant and
remove access to pages as needed.
So the VM running QEMU, cannot map guest RAM unless it's been
instructed to do so by the guest.

#2 is desirable because if QEMU gets compromised it has a smaller
attack surface onto the guest.

Yes, there are alternatives.

1. It was suggested by Stefano to try to handle this in existing qemu/hw/xe=
n/*.
This would be less intrusive but perhaps also less explicit.
Concerns about touching the Memory API have been raised before, so
perhaps we should try this.
I'm a little unsure how we would deal with unmapping when the guest
removes our grants and we're using models that don't map but use
address_space_read/write().

2. Another approach could be to change the Xen grant-iommu in the
Linux kernel to work with a grant vIOMMU in QEMU.
Linux could explicitly ask QEMU's grant vIOMMU to map/unmap granted regions=
.
This would have the benefit that we wouldn't need to allocate
address-bit 63 for grants.
A drawback is that it may be slower since we're going to need to
bounce between guest/qemu a bit more.

Yes, I think the grant vIOMMU approach would fall into this category.
