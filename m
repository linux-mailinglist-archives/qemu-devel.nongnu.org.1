This mentions KVM compatibility. KVM now works at least on PowerPC G4 host 
with qemu-system-ppc (as I've heard, did not try it myself). Would that 
stop working with qemu-system-ppc64? As people still use old 32bit PPC 
OSes such as MacOS with qemu it's still wanted to keep it working. 
(Although most people use TCG on other hosts and maybe a few on actual PPC 
host but it's still nice to keep this feature until such hosts still 
exist.)
