package level savings probably won't make a much of dent (older hw, less im=
pact),
but if one would think about vacating/powering down host it's a bit
different story (it was in my home lab case - trying to
minimize idle consumption of 24/7 systems). But even with
that when switching to newer hardware it might come to the point
of diminishing returns eventually.

Looking at discussions around Intel's hybrid CPUs, I got
an impression that not userspace nor kernel have enough energy
consumption info to make decent scheduling decision and no _one
really wishes do scheduling manually_ to begin with. That's where
Intel's CPUs with IDT come into the picture to help kernel
somehow bin tasks based on efficiency figures (since CPU knows
exactly how much resources it is using).
But that's relatively new and whether such cpus will stick or
not is still an open question (it makes sense for mobile market,
but for other applications I'd guess time will show).

we can expose them as ACPI power meter devices, to make it
abstract for guest OS (i.e. guest would need only a standard
driver for it) or alternatively model some of real i2c
sensors. But yes, it something that should be explored so
it would work/supported by common tools or the tool of the choice.

that doesn't preclude us from improving impl. details=20
/i.e. what tasks qemu does and what is upto backend (external daemon)/
though. Incl. changing backend if it that would do a better job
for in the end (with a benefit that it's mostly maintained by another proje=
ct).

I don't argue that data should be thrown away. But just that we should
provide them some other way instead of vCPU RAPL interface. And not
confuse host's pCPU with vCPUs.

PS:
Taking example above that aux threads are inherent pCPU load and
stretch it in to host side. Then one can say pCPU inherently incurs
power draw on other system components with some workloads, so RAPL MSRs
should include that load as well.
But yep, at this point turns into a pointless bike-shedding.

PS2:
in nutshell, my questions are:
 * should we expose aux threads as other power meter device
 * would it be better to reuse/integrate with existing (hopefully mature)
   projects for monitoring on host side instead of duplicating a subset
   of capabilities in QEMU specific helper and then maintain it.
