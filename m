Not directly, it was aimed at Markus. As we work towards a single binary
build we have to consider how the QMP API is going to be presented when
the binary could run a number of different targets. Markus and Philippe
have discussed it before but I forget the details.

Eventually we hope to get to the position QEMU can emulation a
heterogeneous SoC so having multiple architectures under one binary will
present potential issues for debugging.=20

An implementation detail - we should try and avoid needless coupling if
we can though.

AFAIK not all monitor commands map to QMP equivalents but I'm not sure
if that's true the other way around - can you do everything you can over
QMP under HMP? If you don't have to then that implies we can over a
separate schema on a debug socket that doesn't need monitor bits tied
in.
