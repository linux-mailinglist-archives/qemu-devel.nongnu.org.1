This does avoid the assert and now it boots but then can't read the scsi 
device. (I've tried with a scsi-cd with an iso image and it thinks it's an 
audio CD and cannot read data from it). Maybe something else is needed but 
this seems to go one step further. However I don't see "lsi_reset Reset" 
traces other than once when the driver starts so not sure it's really 
related to reset. Could it be that the driver expects it to be able to 
send commands while another one is still processing so the pending one 
would need to be put back in the queue instead of cancelling ir? But I 
don't know how to do that so cannot try unless you can give me a patch.
