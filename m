At this junction, the code generated by these tools is of such
quality that I really won't expect it to pass even cursory code
review.


So for now, I propose adding a single paragraph:

 If you wrote the patch, make sure your "From:" and "Signed-off-by:"
 lines use the same spelling. It's okay if you subscribe or contribute to
 the list via more than one address, but using multiple addresses in one
 commit just confuses things. If someone else wrote the patch, git will
 include a "From:" line in the body of the email (different from your
 envelope From:) that will give credit to the correct author; but again,
 that author's Signed-off-by: line is mandatory, with the same spelling.

+Q: I prompted ChatGPT/Copilot/Llama and it wrote
+   the patch for me. Can I submit it and how do I sign it?
+A: Your patch is likely trash or trivial. Please write your own code.
