I have a fundamental question to ask here. Are we sure SVQ really needs 
this id (GPA) to identify the right translation? Or we're just 
concerning much about the aliased map where there could be one single 
HVA mapped to multiple IOVAs / GPAs, which (the overlapped) is almost 
transient mapping that usually goes away very soon after guest memory 
layout is stabilized? For what I can tell, the caller in SVQ datapath 
code (vhost_svq_vring_write_descs) just calls into 
vhost_iova_tree_find_iova to look for IOVA translation rather than 
identify a specific section on the memory region, the latter of which 
would need the id (GPA) to perform an exact match. The removal case 
would definitely need perfect match on GPA with the additional id, but I 
don't find it necessary for the vhost_svq_vring_write_descs code to pass 
in the id / GPA? Do I miss something?

Thanks,
