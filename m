Is that an artifact of the way QEMU starts up, or is it fundamental?

Maybe "@cpr-transfer: Checkpoint and restart migration mode minimizes
guest pause time by transferring guest RAM without copying it."

If you want to mention the guest RAM mapping differs between old and new
QEMU, that's fine, but it's also detail, so I'd do it further down.

Permit me to indulge in a bit of pedantry...  A channel address doesn't
support SCM_RIGHTS, only a channel may.  A channel supports it when it
is backed by a UNIX domain socket.  The channel's socket's transport
type need not be 'unix' for that, it could also be 'fd'.

Suggest something like "This CPR channel must be a UNIX domain socket."

If you want to say why, that's fine: "This CPR channel must support file
descriptor transfer, i.e. it must be a UNIX domain socket."

If you want to mention SCM_RIGHTS, that's fine, too: "This CPR channel
must support file descriptor transfer with SCM_RIGHTS, i.e. it must be a
UNIX domain socket."

This is a restriction that could conceivably be lifted in the future,
right?

What happens if a user tries to specify it with migrate-incoming?  Fails
cleanly?  What's the error message?

Maybe simply:

         Currently, the CPR channel can only be specified on the command
         line, not with the migrate-incoming command.

with a big, fat comment explaining the restriction next to the spot
that reports the error.

What's "the tcp type"?  URI "tcp:..." / channel
addr.transport=socket,addr.type=inet?

I think some (all?) instances of "old QEMU" and "new QEMU" would read
better as "the old QEMU" and "the new QEMU".
