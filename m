yes. I think this went unnoticed because the push/pull os context
commands are only used by the HV when a vCPU is dipatched on a HW
thread. We would need a test for a KVM guest running under the QEMU
PowerNV POWER10 machine. This requires an image with some tuning
because emulation is a bit slow. I use to have a buildroot image
including a qemu and smaller buildroot image for it.

So, offset is within the full TIMA region (4 pages) and
TM_ADDRESS_MASK is a mask within a page. This needs a fix.

Thanks,

C.
