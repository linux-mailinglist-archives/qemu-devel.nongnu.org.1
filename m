virsh will call virDomainAbortJob when Ctrl-C is done to a 'migrate'
command.

virDomainAbortJob will call migrate-cancel for pre-copy, or
'migrate-pause' for post-copy.

"timeouts work" has the implicit assumpton that the only reason a
timeout will fire is due to a unrecoverable situation. IMHO that
assumption is not valid.
