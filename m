Management applications would be just fine with the different interface.

Human users would be better off.  As is, a missing right parenthesis is
met with silence.  You can then input whatever you want, and get more
silence until you somehow close the last parenthesis.  Quite confusing
unless you already know.

Me not liking what we have, when what we have works, is no reason to
rewrite it.

Even the lousy usability for humans doesn't justify a rewrite.

Single quotes should've been restricted to internal use, just like
interpolation.

Thanks!
