From: "Maciej S. Szmigiero" <maciej.szmigiero@oracle.com>

This is an updated v4 patch series of the v3 series located here:
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/cover.1731773021.git.maciej.szmigiero@oracle.com/

Changes from v3:
* MigrationLoadThread now returns bool and an Error complex error type
instead of just an int.

* qemu_loadvm_load_thread_pool now reports error via migrate_set_error()
instead of dedicated load_threads_ret variable.

* Since the change above uncovered an issue with respect to multifd send
channels not terminating TLS session properly QIOChannelTLS now allows
gracefully handling this situation.

* qemu_loadvm_load_thread_pool state is now part of MigrationIncomingState
instead of being stored in global variables.
This state now also has its own init/cleanup helpers.

* qemu_loadvm_load_thread_pool code is now moved into a separate section
of the savevm.c file, marked by an appropriate comment.

* thread_pool_free() is now documented to have wait-before-free semantic,
which allowed removal of explicit waits from thread pool cleanup paths.

* thread_pool_submit_immediate() method was added since this functionality
is used by both generic thread pool users in this patch set.

* postcopy_ram_listen_thread() now takes BQL around function calls that
ultimately call migration methods requiring BQL.
This fixes one of QEMU tests failing when explicitly BQL-sensitive code
is added later to these methods.

* qemu_loadvm_load_state_buffer() now returns a bool value instead of int.

* "Send final SYNC only after device state is complete" patch was
dropped since Peter implemented equivalent functionality upstream.

* "Document the BQL behavior of load SaveVMHandlers" patch was dropped
since that's something better done later, separately from this patch set.

* Header size is now added to mig_stats.multifd_bytes where it is actually
sent in the zero copy case - in multifd_nocomp_send_prepare().

* Spurious wakeups from qemu_cond_wait() are now handled properly as
pointed out by Avihai.

* VFIO migration FD now allows partial write() completion as pointed out
by Avihai.

* Patch "vfio/migration: Don't run load cleanup if load setup didn't run"
was dropped, instead all objects related to multifd load are now located in
their own VFIOMultifd struct which is allocated only if multifd device state
transfer is actually in use.

* Intermediate VFIOStateBuffers API as suggested by Avihai is now introduced
to simplify vfio_load_state_buffer() and vfio_load_bufs_thread().

* Optional VFIO device config state loading interlocking with loading
other iterables is now possible due to ARM64 platform VFIO dependency on
interrupt controller being loaded first as pointed out by Avihai.

* Patch "Multifd device state transfer support - receive side" was split
into a few smaller patches as suggested by CÃ©dric.

* x-migration-multifd-transfer VFIO property compat changes were moved
into a separate patch as suggested by CÃ©dric.

* Other small changes, like renamed functions and variables/members, added
review tags, code formatting, moved QEMU_LOCK_GUARD() instances closer to
actual protected blocks, etc.

========================================================================

This patch set is targeting QEMU 10.0.

What's not yet present is documentation update under docs/devel/migration
but I didn't want to delay posting the code any longer.
Such doc can still be merged later when the design is 100% finalized.
