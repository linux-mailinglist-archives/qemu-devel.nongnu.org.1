Assuming QMP users need to know (see right below), can we trust they
understand which one applies when?  If not, can we provide clues?

Do we think the doc comment sufficient for QMP users to figure this out?
If not, can we provide clues?

In particular, do we think they can go from an export failure to the
setting @iothreads here?  Perhaps the error message will guide them.
What is the message?

Interesting to whom?

Users of QMP?  Then explaining it in the doc comment (and thus the QEMU
QMP Reference Manual) is proper.

Just developers?  Then the doc comment is the wrong spot.

The QEMU QMP Reference Manual is for users of QMP.  It's dense reading.
Information the users are not expected to need / understand makes that
worse.
