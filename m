Hm, this would work, but not only does it complicate the code
consuming address_space_map, but it also increases memory footprint (a
pointer being replaced by a struct of sizeof(BounceBuffer) if done
naively), plus there's an additional pointer indirection (I'm doubtful
whether this can be optimized away by the compiler). I haven't done
any measurements of these effects, so can't say anything definitive,
but this seems pretty costly just to appease coverity...

Is there no way to inform coverity that a resource pointer is being
transmuted into a handle, so it can track that instead? Given that
pointer tricks like this and container_of usage is quite frequent, I
would expect coverity to have a better strategy to handle these rather
than suppressing false positive leak reports?

If coverity can be made to understand this, it seems we should at
least be able to mark the allocation in question as intentional leak
(and thus not to report) at the position in the code where we allocate
the bounce buffer, rather than having to create false positive
suppressions for every caller. Perhaps this would be simplified if we
extract out a function to allocate and initialize the bounce buffer,
and then tell coverity to assume that anything it returns is not a
leak? (My coverity experience is rather limited, just thinking out
loud based on what I've seen in other projects to help static analysis
tools in general)
