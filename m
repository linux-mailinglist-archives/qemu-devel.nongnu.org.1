qemu versions 4.2 and before allowed this behavior.

I don't think it's valid to ask for a *popular* guest OS as a
proof-of-concept because I'm not an expert on those. The spec says "last
byte" which can (not "should" just "can") be interpreted as "cbp - 1".
Therefore, I raised this patch request to re-enable the previous qemu
behavior, in the sense of ""be conservative in what you do, be liberal in
what you accept from others" -
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle

It is *not* valid to say the spec disallows "cbp - 1" to mean "empty
buffer." That is what I am arguing :)
