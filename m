Well this seems not what spec said. See Figure 3-2, when RDT=3D=3DRDH,
nothing is owned by hardware. And this is what Dmitry said in the
commit mentioned above.

Which version of the driver did you use in the guest? (Or have you
tried to download the one from Intel website) I'm asking since e1000
support has been deprecated by Microsoft for years.
