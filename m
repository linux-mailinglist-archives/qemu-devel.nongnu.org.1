Yes, it's just a different completion mode.

I'm not sure, having the option on the complete command makes more sense
to me than having it in blockdev-mirror.

I do see the challenge of representing this meaningfully in QAPI,
though. Semantically it should be a union with job-specific options and
only mirror adds the graph-changes option. But the union variant
can't be directly selected from another option - instead we have a job
ID, and the variant is the job type of the job with this ID.

Practically speaking, we would probably indeed end up with an optional
field in the existing completion command.

Apart from the open question where to put the option, agreed.

I think everyone agreed that this is how things should be, and nobody
did anything to achieve it.

Hm... That would commit everything down to the lower layer and then keep
the old overlays still around?

I could see a limited use case for committing into the immediate backing
file and then keep using the overlay to accumulate new changes (would be
more useful if we discarded the old content). Once you have intermediate
backing files, I don't think it makes any sense any more.
