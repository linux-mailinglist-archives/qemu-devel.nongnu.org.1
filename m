The "channel discovery" part can be considered as a separate patch
because in order to integrate it with the new feature you had to
introduce a new concept of enum CH_* which is not a trivially verifiable
change. That change has the potential to break other use-cases of
migration and although the tests are passing we must be cautions about
it. Simply having that part as a patch is enough separation that an
issue there won't be conflated with the multifd+postcopy feature in
general.

I also called it "in preparation" for the feature because the channel
discovery part is clearly a preexisting issue, in the sense that had we
had proper magic numbers in all channels or some other mechanism to
diffrentiate channels, we wouldn't need this patch. That's a cleanup
you're doing beforehand in order to make the subsequent patches simpler.

Changing that code makes sense regardless of whether there is a new
feature being introduced.

Note that none of this is out of the ordinary, you'll find such
discussions in any thread on this community. It may feel arbitrary to
you because that's tacit knowledge we gathered along the years.

Yes, whenever you can frame a code change as a pure refactoring, you
should do that. If, say, you had to change 100 lines in order to
implement your feature, but 90 of those lines are just preserving the
existing behavior, that is a good candidate to be a separate patch.

Reviewers will be more inclined to approve the patch, since reading code
and making sure it doesn't change behavior is easier than also
accounting for the new behavior simultaneously.

Maintainers moving patches around, merging, testing, etc will have an
easier time when solving git conflicts because the separate code is more
easily compared with the old one.

Backporters have similar issues with git, but also face questions about
the safety of bringing a patch as a prerequisite into older QEMU
versions. Imagine someone wants to enable multifd+postcopy in QEMU 9.2,
it'll be easier for them to have code more clearly defined as
patches. Another scenario could be if the changes to the channel
discovery actually fix a bug that we're currently not aware of. That
would show up in a bisect session and we wouldn't want to apply a patch
that fixes a bug if the same patch also enables a feature.

We need an extra patch that reads:

 migration: Refactor channel discovery mechanism
 
 The various logical migration channels don't have a standardized way of
 advertising themselves and their connections may be seen out of order
 by the migration destination. When a new connection arrives, the
 incoming migration currently make use of heuristics to determine which
 channel it belongs to.
 
 The next few patches will need to change how the multifd and postcopy
 capabilities interact and that affects the channel discovery heuristic.
 
 Refactor the channel discovery heuristic to make it less opaque and
 simplify the subsequent patches.
 
 <some description of the new code which might be pertinent>
 ---

You'd move all of the channel discovery code into this patch. Some of it
will be unreacheable because multifd is not yet allowed with postcopy,
but that's fine. You can mention it on the commit message.

About moving the code out of migration.c, it was a suggestion that
you're free to push back. Ideally, doing the work would be faster than
arguing against it on the mailing list. But that's fine.

About the hang in the test. It doesn't reproduce often, but once it
does, it hangs forever (although I haven't waited that long).
