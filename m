 ACPI/SMBIOS avocado tests using biosbits

+Introduction
+************
 Biosbits is a software written by Josh Triplett that can be downloaded
 from https://biosbits.org/. The github codebase can be found
-`here <https://github.com/biosbits/bits/tree/master>`__. It is a software that executes
-the bios components such as acpi and smbios tables directly through acpica
-bios interpreter (a freely available C based library written by Intel,

+executes the bios components such as acpi and smbios tables directly through

 downloadable from https://acpica.org/ and is included with biosbits) without an
-operating system getting involved in between.
+operating system getting involved in between. Bios-bits has python integration
+with grub so actual routines that executes bios components can be written in
+python instead of bash-ish (grub's native scripting language).
 There are several advantages to directly testing the bios in a real physical
-machine or VM as opposed to indirectly discovering bios issues through the
-operating system. For one thing, the OSes tend to hide bios problems from the
-end user. The other is that we have more control of what we wanted to test

+machine or in a VM as opposed to indirectly discovering bios issues through the
+operating system (the OS). Operating systems tend to bypass bios problems and
+hide them from the end user. We have more control of what we wanted to test and
+how by being as close to the bios on a running system as possible without a
+complicated software component such as an operating system coming in between.
+Another issue is that we cannot exercise bios components such as ACPI and
+SMBIOS without being in the highest hardware privilege level, ring 0 for
+example in case of x86. Since the OS executes from ring 0 whereas normal user
+land software resides in unprivileged ring 3, operating system must be modified
+in order to write our test routines that exercise and test the bios. This is
+not possible in all cases. Lastly, test frameworks and routines are preferably
+written using a high level scripting language such as python. OSes and
+OS modules are generally written using low level languages such as C and
+low level assembly machine language. Writing test routines in a low level
+language makes things more cumbersome. These and other reasons makes using
+bios-bits very attractive for testing bioses. More details on the inspiration
+for developing biosbits and its real life uses can be found in [#a]_ and [#b]_.
