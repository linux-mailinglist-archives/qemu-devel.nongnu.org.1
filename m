For VDUSE probably yes, but not for other parents. It's easy to
mandate on day 0 but might be hard for now.

For mlx5e, it supports the semantic
VHOST_BACKEND_F_ENABLE_AFTER_DRIVER_OK even before the feature bit is
introduced.

And we don't do other checks like for example setting vq address, size
after DRIVER_OK.

We can hear from others.

It negotiates virtio features but not vhost backend features.

Thanks
