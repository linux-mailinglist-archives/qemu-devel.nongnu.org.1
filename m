IMHO the problems with updating avocado in QEMU are a sign that we're
suffering from excess complexity, as it shouldn't be this difficult to
update the test harness. That we need to stick on an LTS release to
protect us from further instability further suggests that we would
benefit from a much simpler solution here.

Looking back to when we introduced avocado, we still had our original
home grown build system, and multiple different ways to run integrate
testing betwen our unit tests / qtests and block iotests. Adding
avocado to the mix introduced a third way to run tests. All round it
was rather a mess of inconsistent approaches to testing, but that was
a fact of life with our old home grown build/test process.

Today we have adopted a much more standardized build system via meson.
While we do still have the block iotests harness, we now expose every
test to meson individually to reduce what the intermediate harness
needs to be involved in doing. Thomas' series here is bringing the same
simplified integration to our functional tests, such that each functional
test is known to meson individually. Overall we'll now have a consistent
approach to integrating tests into meson, without intermediate harnesses
adding their own logic.

I think this will make it easier for QEMU maintainers to understand how
the tests are working, and make it easier to maintain them and troubleshoot
failures.

So overall I'm not seeing a compelling reason for us to offer users a
choice between meson & avocado how they run tests. Such choice is a maint
burden over the long term, as we need to validate that both options keep
working. Focusing on a single option reduces the complexity and maint
work and gives us more flexiblity to evolve the code over time.

The series here is showing how simple it is to adapt our existing
tests to the new execution approach, so shouldn't have a significant
impact on ability of people to contribute futher tests in future.
