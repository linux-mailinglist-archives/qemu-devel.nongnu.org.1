I first explain why (1) results in a circular reference, and generalize 
the argument to (2) and (3).

Semantically, (1) has the following dependencies:

Owner <-> Subregion
Owner <-> Container
Container -> Subregion

However, the bidirectional dependencies prevents finalization, so 
piggybacking is done. It makes the following reference relationship:

Owner -> Subregion
Owner -> Container
Container -> Owner

In this case, we still have a circular reference:
Owner -> Container -> Owner

This could be generalized: if you replace Subregion with (any kind of) 
MemoryRegion and Container with "X", it will look like follows:

Owner -> MemoryRegion
Owner -> X
X -> Owner

In case of (2), "X" is an AddressSpace.
In case of (3), "X" is a mapped address.

Piggybacking is indeed simpler but has the three possible circular 
reference scenarios I mentioned earlier.

[1] only handles (1) but this covers the entire class of memory leaks, 
including (2) and (3).

This function will never be called with an object created with 
object_new(TYPE_MEMORY_REGION). It is called by memory_region_init() and 
memory_region_init_iommu() and they call object_initialize(). If an 
object created with object_new(TYPE_MEMORY_REGION) is passed to them, it 
will result in double object initialization, which doesn't make sense.
