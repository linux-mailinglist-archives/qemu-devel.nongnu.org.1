I think, they are qdev properties, not VMStateInfo. In this series I do
remove old .get / .set interfaces, and compilation still works for me..

Maybe some modules are not included into my build config? Unfortunately yes:

> git grep -A 5 'VMStateInfo .* = {' | grep '\.get' | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq
hw/usb/redirect.c-
target/alpha/machine.c-
target/arm/machine.c-
target/avr/machine.c-
target/hppa/machine.c-
target/microblaze/machine.c-
target/mips/system/machine.c-
target/openrisc/machine.c-
target/ppc/machine.c-
target/sparc/machine.c-


That's 10 more commits. And the whole series would be 32, involving many people..

I think, I'll resend only migration/* commits as "part I", except for 20/22 (to save
old interfaces too), and then other parts in separate smaller series.
