Patch 7, when applied without patch 6 and prior, will crash in
device-introspect-test, trying to create yet another migration object when
processing the "device-list-properties" QMP command.  And it turns out
that's also not the only way QEMU can crash by that.

Fundamentally it's because patch 7 has global operations within
init()/finalize() to fix the migration dangling pointer, hence it must not
be instanciated more than once.

It's also probably because I always think singleton can be useful in
general to QEMU's device model where can be special devices all over the
places that I'm not aware of.  I didn't work on a lot of QEMU devices, but
with that limited experience I still stumbled upon two devices (if taking
migration object as one..) that might benefit from it.

That leads to this whole series, which is also the cleanest so far I can
think of to solve the immediate migration UAF.
