I'm asking because our basic expected position is "commits
are from the submitter's actual name, not a pseudonym". Obviously
we can't tell if people use a consistent plausible looking
pseudonym whether that corresponds to their real-world name
or not, but if you have a real name you're happy to attach
to this patch and are merely using a pseudonym for Google
email, then the resubmit of this patch didn't seem to me
to do that. i.e. I was expecting the change to be "make the
patch From: match the Signed-off-by line", not "make the
Signed-off-by line match the patch From:". (For avoidance
of doubt, we don't care about the email From: line, which
is distinct from the commit message From: i.e. author.)
So I was essentially asking "did you mean to do this, or did
you misunderstand what we were asking for?".

On the question of the actual patch, I'll try to get to it
if Gerd doesn't first (though I have a conference next week
so it might be the week after). The main thing I need to chase
down is whether it's OK to call usb_packet_addbuf() with a
zero length or not.

thanks
