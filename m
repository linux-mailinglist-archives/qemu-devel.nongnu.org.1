Hi,

My name is Sahil and I go by the pseudonym 'valdaarhun' on Github. I have
never contributed to QEMU before but I have used it a few times as an end
user. I developed an interest in virtualization during my internship at
VMware and would like to dive deeper in this subfield.

My current full-time job does not allow me to take part in external programs
that are paid. I would like to work on one of the proposed projects outside
of GSoC. I have gone through QEMU's list of GSoC '24 projects [1] and am
interested in two of them:

1. Add packed virtqueue to Shadow Virtqueue
2. vhost-user memory isolation

Based on what I have understood, they are somewhat related and are part
of the migration subsystem. I feel the learning curve of the first project
will be less steep and will make me better prepared to tackle the second
project as well.

I have read the "Getting Started for Developers" [2] wiki page. I have also
built QEMU from source.

I think my next step should be to read the documentation on the migration
subsystem [3], the blog posts attached in the first project's description
and virtqueue's implementation. Would you also recommend that I work on a
QEMU issue that is open on Gitlab and related to virtqueues/virtio to 
familiarize
myself with the codebase? I went through the issues tagged as "device:virtio" 
[4]
but can't really tell if any of them are good for beginners. One of them has 
the
"bite-size" tag [5]. It also has a patch attached but hasn't been merged. 
Shall I
work on getting that merged?

I have worked on a few smaller systems programming issues in other
organizations (eg: strace [6], htop [7]) in the past.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Sahil
