 From my tests, about physical RoCE devices, for example, Nvidia MLX5 
and intel E810 (iRDMA), if RDMA feature is disabled on those devices. 
RXE can work well with them.

About Virtual devices, most virtual devices can work well with RXE, for 
example,bonding, veth. I have done a lot of tests with them.

If some virtual devices can not work well with RXE, please share the 
error messages in RDMA maillist.
