I am thinking the p->normal is mostly redundant.. at least on the sender
side that I just read.  Since I'll be preparing a new spin of the multifd
cleanup series I posted, maybe I can append one more to try dropping
p->normal[] completely.

Yeah something like that if you agree; I'd think socket_plain can also use
the same socket send() with all the rest?  Again, I don't see its specialty
except the zero copy possibility, while the latter should be able to be
covered by proper setup of p->write_flags.
