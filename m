Right, ram_device_mem_ops is what we'll use to access a BAR that
supports mmap but for whatever reason we're accessing it directly
through the mmap.  For instance if an overlapping quirk prevents the
page from being mapped to the VM or we have some back channel mechanism
where the VMM is interacting with the BAR.

I bring it up here because it's effectively the same kind of access
you're adding with these helpers and would need to be addressed if this
were generically enabling vfio mmap access on s390x.

Prior to commit 2b8fe81b3c2e ("system/memory: use ldn_he_p/stn_he_p")
the mmio helpers here might have been a drop-in replacement for the
dereferencing of mmap offsets, but something would need to be done
about the explicit PCI assumption introduced here and the possibility
of unaligned accesses that the noted commit tries to resolve.  Thanks,

Alex
