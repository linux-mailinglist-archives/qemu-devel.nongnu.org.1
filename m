I guess it boils down to whether there is an actionable response in
that message.  If a test is skipped because it is the wrong format
(for example, ./check -raw skipping a test that only works with
qcow2), there's nothing for me to do.  If a test is skipped because my
setup didn't permit running the test, but where I could enhance my
environment (install more software, pick a different file system,
...), then having the skip message call that out is useful if I want
to take action to get more test coverage.  Even if the message is
present, we have so many tests intentionally skipped that it is hard
to see the few tests where a skip could be turned into a pass by
installing a prerequisite.

It looks like for now, the only difference in the two designations is
the output color, and even then, only if you are running the tests in
an environment where color matters (CI systems may not be showing
colors as intended).

I'll hold off queuing the patch while conversation continues.
