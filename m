Does "more flexibility or stability across different machines" also

If possible, it would be really helpful (and user-friendly) to be able
to specify the CPU feature names as you see under /proc/cpuinfo, and be
able to turn the flags on or off:
    
        -M virt -cpu franken,rndr=on,ts=on,fhm=off

(... instead of specifying long system register IDs that groups together
a bunch of CPU features.  If I understand it correctly, the register
"ID_AA64ISAR0_EL1" maps to a set of visible features listed here:
https://docs.kernel.org/arch/arm64/cpu-feature-registers.html)


Next, I prefix the below by noting that I wrote it before seeing
Cornelia's reply that the name "custom" is not set in stone:
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-arm/2024-10/msg00987.html.

I wonder if the word "custom" is starting to get overloaded; on x86:

  - Libvirt itself uses the term "custom" this way, to quote its
    documentation[1] for the 'custom' XML attribute:

      custom
    
      In this mode, the 'cpu' element describes the CPU that should be
      presented to the guest. This is the default when no 'mode'
      attribute is specified. This mode makes it so that a persistent
      guest will see the same hardware no matter what host the guest is
      booted on.

  - Some management tools also follow libvirt and use the term "custom"
    to refer to one of two things, (a) a specific named CPU model that
    libvirt and QEMU recognize, e.g. "Cascadelake-Server"; or (b) a
    named CPU model + extra CPU flags, e.g. this is how OpenStack
    uses[2] "custom" to configure CPU models, and flags that can be
    enabled or disabled via "+" or "-":

      [libvirt]
      cpu_mode = custom
      cpu_model = IvyBridge-IBRS
      cpu_model_extra_flags="ss,+vmx,-pcid [...]"

    (Note the "cpu_mode" there: it is referring to the three possible
    modes that libvirt and QEMU support today: 'host-passthrough',
    'host-model', and named CPU models via "custom".)

    The above config translates to this QEMU command-line:

        -cpu IvyBridge-IBRS,ss=on,vmx=on,pcid=off [...]

Now if QEMU introduces "custom", it is likely to create some confusion.
But luckily, as referenced above, it is open to change. :)

    * * *

FWIW, I agree with Dan here[3] that it would cause less future pain if
Arm's named CPU models also decides on a "baseline that matches some
corresponding real world silicon".  I've experienced plenty of such
debugging pain in x86-land from years of troubleshooting live migration
bugs involving CPU model (in)compatibility.  (Often, with help from
DanPB and Jiri Denemark).
