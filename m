shim is https://fedora.mirrorservice.org/fedora/linux/development/rawhide/Everything/x86_64/os/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI

Well.  It's not that easy unfortunately.  At least the "minimized certs"
part.  shim often is signed with the microsoft keys only, so you can't
drop that without rendering the install.iso unbootable.

Only adding the distro certs without removing the microsoft certs works
of course.

Yep.

See above.  I'd love this being true but it is not.

I prefer (B) over (D) because that doesn't require a new config option
(which probably needs support in libvirt and possibly higher up in the
management stack too ...).

Patch series implementing (B) and the -shim switch:
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20240411094830.1337658-1-kraxel@redhat.com/

Using -shim is optional, so it's up to virt-install whenever it wants go
for (b) or (c).

take care,
  Gerd
