If you look at the next patch you can see the base calculatoin is gone and 
it does pte_addr = ppc_hash32_hpt_base(cpu) + pteg_off once at the 
beginning before the loop, then the function you want to make is just: 
pte0 = ldl_phys(CPU(cpu)->as, pte_addr). I don't think it's worth making 
it a separate fucntion .The other one
pte1 = ldl_phys(CPU(cpu)->as, pte_addr + HASH_PTE_SIZE_32 / 2)
still has some calculation left but that's pretty straight forward. Maybe 
we could add a mcacro for HASH_PTE_SIZE_32 / 2 like HARH_PTE1_OFFS or 
something but I don't think that or having separate functions for this 
would add any more clarity just unnecessary complication. Yout one line 
helpers would only be used by ppc_hash32_pteg_search which is already a 
helper tp get pte values so open coding it within this function is OK in 
my opinion. There are no other places your helper functions would be 
needed.
