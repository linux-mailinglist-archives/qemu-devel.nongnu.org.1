Indeed it may or may not be easy always.

The good thing about this parameter is we always use the old estimation if
the user can't specify anything valid, so this is always optional not
required.

It solves the cases where the user can still specify accurately on the bw -
our QE team has already verified that it worked for us on GPU tests, where
it used to not be able to migrate at all with any sane downtime specified.
I should have attached a Tested-By from Zhiyi but since this is not exactly
the patch he was using I didn't.

I worry the new name suggested is not straightforward enough at the 1st
glance, even to me as a developer.

"available-bandwidth" doesn't even bind that value to "convergence" at all,
even though it was for solving this specific problem here. I wanted to make
this parameter sololy for the admin to answer the question "how much
bandwidth is available to QEMU migration in general?"  That's pretty much
straightforward IMHO.  With that, it's pretty sane to consider using all we
have during switchover (aka, unlimited bandwidth, as fast as possible).

Maybe at some point we can even leverage this information for other purpose
rather than making the migration converge.
