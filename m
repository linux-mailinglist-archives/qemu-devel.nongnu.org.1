I agree that errors should be used only for "abnormal" outcomes, not for
the "no" answer to a simple question like "is SEV available, and if yes,
what are its capabilities?"

I further agree that encoding "no" as GenericError runs the risk of
conflating "no" with other errors.  Since query-sev itself can fail just
one way, these can only come from the QMP core.  For the core's syntax
and type errors, the risk is only theoretical: just don't do that.
Errors triggered by state, like the one in qmp_command_available(), are
a bit more worrying.  I think they're easy enough to avoid if you're
aware, but "if you're aware" is admittedly rittle.

Anyway, that's what we have.  Badly designed, but it seems to be
workable.

Is the bad enough to justify revising the interface?  I can't see how to
do that compatibly.

Is it bad enough to justify new interfaces for similar things to be
dissimilar?
