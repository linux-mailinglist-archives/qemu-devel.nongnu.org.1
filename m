Our two sets of users (humans & machines) have pretty different
desires in many respects. To suit machines, we've made our config
more and more expressive & detailed. This has worked well for
machines. Humans have largely ignored most of it though, and
stuck with the massively simpler ("legacy") config approaches.

Every now & then though, humans are forced to use the modern low
level config to access some edge case feature not exposed in the
legacy syntax. Pain and suffering ensues.


I feel like we have become somewhat incapable of innovating on
features that are in the interests of humans, because our thought
processes get derailed by a desire to keep thing fully expressive
for machines, and the human areas of code are often the most
crufty with highest risk of breakage.

My wish is that when we switch to a new binary, we exclusively
focus on machines, and build a human focused frontend above
that, so we have clean separation, and we can do whatever we
thing is right for humans without being distracted by whether
machines can consume it or not, and vica-verca.

The default devices/backends in machines are an artifact of use trying
to do something which suits both humans and machines, while at the same
time hardcoding machine definitions.

Our '-nodefaults' hack is a gross solution to this problem.

An ability to dynamically define machines could give us a far more
attractive solution to this problem.

<handwaving>

eg we could have a  'q35-minimal.cfg'  configuration that defined
the minimal 'q35' machine type, along with a 'q35-recommended.cfg'
that added the typical extra devices, and possibly even a further
'q35-simple.cfg' that added the typical extra devices, alongw ith
typical extra backend connectivity.

Using a 'q35-minimal.cfg' the mgmt app would have to setup all
backends and extra devices explicitly as it saw fit.

Using a 'q35-recommended.cfg' the human would merely have to
provide backend configuration

Using a 'q35-simple.cfg' the human would merely need to provide
a disk image path.
</handwaving>

this would also solve our forever problem of "sensible defaults"
for RAM size, CPU model, etc being an undecidable problem. We
could have 'q35-tiny.cfg' and 'q35-huge.cfg', or any number of
other profile variants. Or we could have 'q35-windows.cfg' and
'q35-linux.cfg'.

We wouldn't have needed to create 'microvm' at all, Kata could
have just defined a suitable config themselves which was optimal
for their needs. 

Essentially once machine types are turned into data, instead of
code we improve life for humans and machines alike, and likely
eliminate entire classes of problems[1].


I wonder if machine types as data might also have a positive
impact on our migration compatibility support. Say we screw up
and break migrate compat between 2 QEMU releases. Fixing it
requires new code releases and builds. Fixing it with just a
data update may well be easier to consume. On the flip side,
however, if mgmt apps are maintaining their own configuration
for defining machines, they might have to take on full
responsibility for adding changes to their config ro preserve
ABI.

With regards,
Daniel
