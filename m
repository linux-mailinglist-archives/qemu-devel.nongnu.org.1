Launching QEMU to talk QMP is our defined public API for querying
anything about the capabilities of QEMU. We're worked hard to get
away from providing ad-hoc ways to query QEMU from the command
line and going back to that is not desirable. It may be slightly
more complicated, but not by very much.
