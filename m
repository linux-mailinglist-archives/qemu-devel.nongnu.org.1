Right, we have:

#     -> { "execute": "query-version" }
#     <- {
#           "return":{
#              "qemu":{
#                 "major":0,
#                 "minor":11,
#                 "micro":5
#              },
#              "package":""
#           }
#        }


We could add an extra field to it thus:


#     -> { "execute": "query-version" }
#     <- {
#           "return":{
#              "qemu":{
#                 "major":0,
#                 "minor":11,
#                 "micro":5,
#                 "tag": "rc2"
#              },
#              "package":""
#           }
#        }

arguably we are still in strictly ascending order for the
numeric part, we merely didn't bump the numeric part of
the value at rc releases.

Downstream I see no issues. There are already many projects which
use a '-dev' or '-rcNN' suffix for tarballs of unreleased versions,
and distros have guidelines on how they deal with this.

In fact downstream already deals with it for QEMU, because they will
typically set packaging versioning based on the version as seen in
the tarball name, not the different version seen in the VERSION file
(and thus QMP).

With regards,
Daniel
