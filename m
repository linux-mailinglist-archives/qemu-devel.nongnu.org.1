This is what I wanted to do (in the next version), but it results in
more complex and less readable code:

A) "abc"|NULL

hmp_info_migrate_parameters:
    monitor_printf(..., params->tls_creds ? params->tls_creds->u.s : "");

migrate_tls_creds:
    if (s->parameters.tls_creds) {
        return s->parameters.tls_creds->u.s;
    }
    return NULL;

migrate_params_check:
    if (migrate_zero_copy_send() && params->tls_creds ...

qmp_migrate_set_parameters:
    migrate_params_test_apply(params);
    if (migrate_params_check(tmp)) {
        migrate_params_apply(params);
        tls_normalize_qnull_empty_str_to_null(&s->parameters);  <-- [1]
    }

qmp_query_migrate_parameters:
    params = QAPI_CLONE(MigrationParameters, &s->parameters);
    tls_normalize_null_back_to_empty_str();   <-- [2]

Issues here are that in [1] we can't normalize earlier because we need
QTYPE_QNULL to know whether the option was ever set and in [2], since
s->parameters may contain NULL, we need another conversion step to be
able to return "". Overall, this makes the normalization step not very
useful because we need to keep track of which parts of the code are
normalized or not.

If we instead normalize to "either non-empty string or empty string"
then:

B) "abc"|""

hmp_info_migrate_parameters:
    monitor_printf(..., params->tls_creds);

migrate_tls_creds:
    if (*s->parameters.tls_creds->u.s) {
        return s->parameters.tls_creds->u.s;
    }
    return NULL;   <-- [1]

migrate_params_check:
    if (migrate_zero_copy_send() && *params->tls_creds->u.s ...

qmp_migrate_set_parameters:
    tls_normalize_qnull_null_to_str(&s->parameters);  <-- [2]
    migrate_params_test_apply(params);
    if (migrate_params_check(tmp)) {
        migrate_params_apply(params);
    }

qmp_query_migrate_parameters:
    params = QAPI_CLONE(MigrationParameters, &s->parameters);

The query methods get simpler because s->parameters already contains
data in the format they expect, we can normalize earlier in [2], which
means data is always in the same format throughout
qmp_migrate_set_parameters() and lastly, we already have the getter
methods [1] which can expose "abc"|NULL to the rest of the code anyway.

My main concern is that reading can rely on it being normalized, but the
query methods cannot, so they need to do an "extra conversion", which
from the reader's POV, will look nonsensical. It's not as simple as
using a ternary because the StrOrNull object needs to be allocated.

Coming back to this, I implemented a DEFINE_PROP_STR_OR_NULL. It's way
better than removing the options, because this allows a default to be
set, which means query-migrate-parameters() doesn't need to deal with an
initial NULL value anymore (if query is called before set).

This allows dropping about half of the parameters we expose. Deprecate
the other half, move the remaining legitimate compat options into
MigrationParameters, (which can be set by migrate-set-parameters) and
maybe we can remove the TYPE_DEVICE from MigrationState anytime this
decade.

Moving all qdev properties to their own TYPE_DEVICE object and putting
it under --enable-debug is also an idea.

I'm willing to do the work if we ever reach a consensus about this.

>     docs/devel/qapi-code-gen.txt no longer mandates the naming convention.
>     Using it anyway might help writers of programs that aren't
>     full-fledged management applications.  Not using it can save us
>     bothersome renames.  We'll see how that shakes out.
