Yes, we definitely need to shorten the descriptions from the man page
for --help. I think as long as it fits on a single line, it's okay, but
I understand if you want to keep it even shorter in some cases.

If this is too wordy for your liking, just "quiet mode" could be enough,
but I would keep the terminology the same (i.e. not "operations" here
and "mode" there").

The nature of your series is that a big part of the review is actually
the new help text, so it's unavoidable to have some wording discussions
here and there. Don't necessarily take my suggestions as the final word,
they are just suggestions on which we can iterate and find the best
wording for users. I think refining help texts is worth some thought and
back and forth between multiple people. So if you don't like my
suggestions, or you prefer a mix of yours and mine, or you have
additional improvements to them, feel free to say so.

Kevin
