Its a double edged sword. If someone's grammer is sufficiently bad to
need correcting, will a machine actually suggest an alternative phrasing
that accurately represents the author's intent, or will it result in
something more misleading, and will they realize the difference ?

Each to their own, but I'd prefer to see the author's own original words,
and query them myself if unclear.

I don't think we're expecting users to go searching out fine details of
the internals of tools. Just use their best judgement based on easily
identifiable information.

IOW, if something openly advertizes itself as being "AI" driven, that's
a bad choice to use for QEMU, but if something is secretly using AI
internally without being advertized, we wouldn't/shouldn't blame users
if they aren't aware of this fact.

With regards,
Daniel
