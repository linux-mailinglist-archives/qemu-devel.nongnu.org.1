Split accel.cpu_instance_init() into cpu's instance_init() and 
post_instance_init() does not seem right way to go.

The reason .post_instance_init() was implemented and put 
accel_cpu_instance_init() in it for x86 cpu was that, we don't want to 
scatter acceletor specific instance_init operation into different 
subclass of x86 cpu (max/host/named cpu model).

I think something like below should be enough.

     i386/cpu: Re-apply the global props as the last step of post_init

     Commit 220c739903ce ("qom: reverse order of instance_post_init calls")
     reverses the order instance_post_init calls, which leads to
     device_post_init() called before x86 cpu specific 
.instance_post_init().

     However, x86 cpu replies on qdev_prop_set_globals() (inside
     device_post_init()) to apply the cpu option like "feature[=foo]" passed
     via '-cpu' as the last step to make the '-cpu' option highest priority.

     After the order change of .instance_post_init(), x86_cpu_post_initfn()
     is called after device_post_init(), and it will change some property
     value even though "-cpu" option specify a different one.

     Re-apply the global props as the last step to ensure "-cpu" option
     always takes highest priority.
