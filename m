Understood, and makes sense. Perhaps you could add this to the commit
message as well?

Indeed. macOS does also have AVX512 support, and I believe there were
two Mac models which shipped with Xeon CPUs that exposed some version
of the feature, the iMac Pro and the 2019 Mac Pro. I don't have access
to such a machine however, so I=E2=80=99m not sure exactly what the host
support entails. (I don't know if HVF guests theoretically could
support AVX512 features supported by the CPU but not the host OS as
long as it only uses register state correctly saved by the host OS?)

X)?

On a 2019 MacBook Pro 15" with a Coffee Lake Intel Core i9 9880H CPU,
the OSPKE bit is not set. (cpuid 7,0 returns: ebx =3D 0x029c67af, ecx =3D
0x40000000, edx =3D 0xbc000e00)

Assuming I'm doing this right, xcr0 on this machine appears to be 0x7,
so there's no PKRU bit set.

While trying to log xcr0, I noticed that xgetbv checks the passed ecx
value against CPUID_EXT_OSXSAVE. Except as far as I'm aware, OSXSAVE
is in cpuid function 1's ecx, whereas the code path in
hvf_get_supported_cpuid() is, by my reading, passing the ecx value for
cpuid function 0xD, index 0. The xgetbv call thus returns false on my
machine (ecx =3D 0x440), and eax is not modified. (stays 0x1f rather
than 0x7)

It seems like we ought to either fetch the CPUID_EXT_OSXSAVE bit in
another cpuid call, or cache it. Or do I have this wrong?

Thanks,
Phil
