Right, it's an interesting idea on its own.  It's just that when QEMU grows
into not only a tool anymore it adds burden on top as you discussed, in
which case we consider dropping things as wins (and we already started
doing so at least in migration, but iiuc it's not limited to migration).

Again, it looks reasonable to drop because I think it's too easy to tool-up
the same "exec:" function with ncat or similar things.  E.g. kubevirt does
TLS even today without qemu's TLS, and AFAIU that's based on unix sockets
not exec, and it tunnels to the daemon for TLS encryption (which is prone
of removal, though).  So even that is not leveraged as we thought.

Thanks,
