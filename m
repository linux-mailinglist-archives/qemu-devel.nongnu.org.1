Thanks for pointing that out. Will be added in the next version.

We've got the dates of modifications available at our version control.
They will be added in the next version of this patch.

BSD 3-Clause Modification matches the license of the MCD API and is
listed under the SPDX License List. Is it possible to extend
checkpatch's @valid with "BSD-3-Clause-Modification"? That way, we can
also add the SPDX-License-Identifier to mcd_api.h without an error being
generated by the script.

Thank you very much for taking the time to review the patch! I will add
the changes in the next version of this series but will wait for further
reviews until submitting v3 in order to keep the mailing list less busy.

Best regards,
Mario
