Alright, I'll try to explain how I came up with this patch. And sorry
if it's a bit blurry, I made it some months ago hence I don't remember
all the details...
So, first, my prime goal was to access a local folder in a QNX system
running on Raspi 4B emulation.
My usual way to pass such a local folder is through `-drive
file=3Dfat:rw:<host_folder>,format=3Draw`. For virt, it's usually
connected to virtio-blk-device: `-drive id=3Ddisk0,if=3Dnone,... -device
virtio-blk-device,drive=3Ddisk0`. For the Raspi 4b, adding the
virtio-blk-device is not possible, hence I have to connect it as a SD
card: `-drive if=3Dsd,...`.

However, without any `size=3D` argument, QEMU will complain that the SD
card has not a valid size:
  | (host) $ qemu-system-aarch64 -M raspi4b -kernel raspi4b-kernel
-nographic -no-reboot -append "earlycon=3Dpl011,mmio32,0xfe201000
console=3DttyAMA0 noreboot" -dtb bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb -initrd
rootfs.cpio.gz  -drive
id=3Dsdcard,file=3Dfat:rw:<host_folder>,format=3Draw,if=3Dsd
  | qemu-system-aarch64: Invalid SD card size: 504 MiB
  | SD card size has to be a power of 2, e.g. 512 MiB.
  | You can resize disk images with 'qemu-img resize <imagefile> <new-size>=
'
  | (note that this will lose data if you make the image smaller than
it currently is).

("raspi4b-kernel", the dtb and the rootfs come from
functional/aarch64/test_raspi4.py)

Hence, I've added `size=3D256M` to reduce the size of that SD card and
make QEMU happy. This allows me to mount my host folder on Linux:
  | (host) $ qemu-system-aarch64 -M raspi4b -kernel raspi4b-kernel
-nographic -no-reboot -append "earlycon=3Dpl011,mmio32,0xfe201000
console=3DttyAMA0 noreboot" -dtb bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb -initrd
rootfs.cpio.gz  -drive
id=3Dsdcard,file=3Dfat:rw:<host_folder>,format=3Draw,if=3Dsd,size=3D256M
  | (QEMU) # fdisk -l /dev/mmcblk1

1032129  503M  6 FAT16

As you can see the "Disk" has the right size (256MB) but the partition
still has a 503M size. However, Linux doesn't seem to care too much
about that as I'm able to mount this partition, and perform IO
operations.
  | (QEMU) # mount /dev/mmcblk1p1 /mnt
  | (QEMU) # ls /mnt
  | file.txt
  | (QEMU) # cat /mnt/file.txt
  | Hello World
  | (QEMU) # echo "OK" > /mnt/test.txt
  | (host) $ cat <host_folder>/test.txt
  | OK

Now, QNX comes into play.
First, the SD card must be connected to another bus. That patch is not
part of this series as I'm considering it a QNX issue. Just FTR here
is the patch:
  | --- a/hw/arm/bcm2838_peripherals.c
  | +++ b/hw/arm/bcm2838_peripherals.c
  | @@ -190,7 +190,7 @@ static void

  | -    object_property_add_alias(OBJECT(s), "sd-bus",

OBJECT(&s->emmc2), "sd-bus");
  |
  |      /* BCM2838 RPiVid ASB must be mapped to prevent kernel crash */

Afterwards, QNX is able to see the SD card, but not able to mount it.
It complains about the filesystem being corrupted. Looking at `fdisk`
output, it shows a mismatch between the "total section" value and the
Cylinders/Heads/etc values.
  | (QEMU) # fdisk /dev/hd0 info
  | Physical disk characteristics: (/dev/hd0)
  |     Disk type        : Direct Access (0)

  |
  | Warning: total sectors field does not agree with
  |            cylinders*sectors/track*heads!! (524288 vs 524160)

The "no-mbr" option introduced in patch 1 is something we (Adacore's
QEMU team) have for a long time. I don't remember the details but we
are using it for other OSes as well (notably RTEMS).
Once added, and the drive command line updated for `-drive
id=3Dsdcard,file=3Dfat:rw:no-mbr:<host_folder>,format=3Draw,if=3Dsd,size=3D=
256M`,
I don't have this warning anymore. Though, I'm still getting the
corrupted filesystem error.

Afterwards, it's a bit blurry but I think by trial and errors we ended
up removing the SD size error and realize that `-drive
id=3Dsdcard,file=3Dfat:rw:no-mbr:<host_folder>,format=3Draw,if=3Dsd` was
working. However, `size=3D256M` still results in a corrupted filesystem.
As a comment in vvfat.c states that it either creates a "32MB or 504
MB disk". I decided to check if I can adapt, hence this patch.

I didn't find any VFAT documentation explaining the relation between
the size and the cylinders, heads, sector per track values. However,
the SD documentation was giving some recommandations, hence I used it
as a base.

I was unable to make `vvfat.c` recognize the "size" argument passed
along `format=3Draw`, even if hardcoding the value in `vvfat.c` did make
a difference. And that's why I'm adding the warning in the commit
message.

I've also realized that following my patch, the mismatch in between
the disk and the partition in Linux was going away when using `-drive
format=3Dvvfat,size=3Dxxx`. Making it not just QNX-oriented.

I probably missed a few things, but I hope this is clearer to you why
and how this series was made.
