(I'd like to CC Sean again to discuss the possibility of user space
 removing arch-capabilities completely for AMD)

This issue looks very similar to this one that others in the community
reported:

https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/3001

But there's a little difference, pls see the below comment...

Yes, disabling this feature bit makes sense on AMD platform. It's fine
for -cpu host.

But this could still break Windows, just like issue #3001, which enables
arch-capabilities for EPYC-Genoa. This fact shows that even explicitly
turning on arch-capabilities in AMD Guest and utilizing KVM's emulated
value would even break something.

So even for named CPUs, arch-capabilities=on doesn't reflect the fact
that it is purely emulated, and is (maybe?) harmful.

I was considering whether we should tweak it in kvm_arch_get_supported_cpuid()
until I saw this:

else if (function == 7 && index == 0 && reg == R_EDX) {
        /* Not new instructions, just an optimization.  */
        uint32_t edx;
        host_cpuid(7, 0, &unused, &unused, &unused, &edx);
        ret |= edx & CPUID_7_0_EDX_FSRM;

        /*
         * Linux v4.17-v4.20 incorrectly return ARCH_CAPABILITIES on SVM hosts.
         * We can detect the bug by checking if MSR_IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES is
         * returned by KVM_GET_MSR_INDEX_LIST.
         */
        if (!has_msr_arch_capabs) {
            ret &= ~CPUID_7_0_EDX_ARCH_CAPABILITIES;
        }
}

What a pity! QEMU had previously workedaround CPUID_7_0_EDX_ARCH_CAPABILITIES
correctly, but since then kvm's commit 0cf9135b773b("KVM: x86: Emulate
MSR_IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES on AMD hosts") breaks the balance once again. 
I understand the commit, and it makes up for the mismatch between the
emulated feature bit and the MSR. Now the Windows exposes the problem of
such emulation.

So, to avoid endless workaround thereafter, I think it's time to just
disable arch-capabilities for AMD Guest (after all, closer to the real
hardware environment is better).

Further, it helps to eliminate kernel/kvm concerns when user space resolves
the legacy issues first. At least, IMO, pushing ABI changes in kernel/kvm
needs to show that there is no destruction of pre-existing user space, so
I believe a complete cleanup of QEMU is the appropriate approach.

The attached code is just some simple example to show what I think:
Starting with QEMU v10.1 for AMD Guest, to disable arch-capabilties
feature bit and MSR.

I don't have an AMD CPU, so it's untested. You can feel free to squash
it in your patch. If so, it's better to add a "Resolves" tag in your
commit message:

Resolves: https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/3001

Thanks,
