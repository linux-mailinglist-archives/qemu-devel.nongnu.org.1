Choose between BqlCell/BqlRefCell like you would choose between
Cell/RefCell. They result in different code so pick what looks better.

That said for HPET you have the array of timers structs, and these structs
are not Copy, and therefore BqlRefCell is almost the only choice for that
array. With BqlRefCell used for the timers you might as well put the other
registers in the same BqlRefCell.

It's not too complex=E2=80=94the point is to make it as similar as possible=
 to
normal single threaded Rust.

However, all in all, using BqlRefCell for register fields looks to be

Yep :)

Thank you! I'll change the current code to support this. Instead of

That's fine. Experimenting in different directions makes it easier for
future developers to evaluate the tradeoffs.

Also related to the above question, I'm a bit hesitant to use BqlCell

Do whatever looks best to you!

Yes, but stuff like "correctly uses interior mutability" is a very good
reason to include the HPET early.

I will send the next version and include BqlRefCell once I incorporate
Junjie's feedback, in the meanwhile I will send you the BqlRefCell patch
off list.
