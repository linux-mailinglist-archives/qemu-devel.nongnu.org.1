that is leftover from experiments with lockless split irqchip,
as we need to use it with more then 255 vCPU, and then we are back
BQL contention as every IO exit will also trigger taking BQL
for non-in-kernel irqchip.

So this series addresses unboottable Windows issue only upto
255 vCPU. If I manage to make split irqchip checks lockless,
it will be a separate series on top.

I'd prefer to reproduce issue if possible, but if that won't workout
it might be better to try and see it explodes elsewhere.
Let's see if I could reproduce with old Seabios as per Gerd's suggestions.

I don't see the need to rush this, so
+1 to the next cycle.
