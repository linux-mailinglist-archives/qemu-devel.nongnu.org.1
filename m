Thanks for this patch. It looks good, so I only have
some minor changes to suggest below.

A minor thing: for a single patch, please don't send a
cover letter -- it confuses some of our automated tooling.
Cover letters are only needed for multi-patch series.

For a single patch, if you want to add notes about e.g.
changes between v1 and v2, you can put them below the '---'
line...

I think I would put this a little further up in the
index, just below "parallels". That way it goes together
with the other image-format specs in the index list.

If we're going to change this kind of thing: the correct spelling
is all-caps "QEMU".

For references in formatted text to things like field names, function
names, filenames and similar fixed-strings, I recommend ``header_length``
(which gives monospaced) rather than *header_length* (which is italics)
or **header_length** (which is bold).

We should be consistent about whether we have the angle brackets
or not.

This is all in a fixed-width text block, so the URL isn't going
to be formatted anyway. Might as well leave the angleb rackets in,
for consistency with e.g. below.

The original text is correct: this should be "make it look like".

Sphinx will interpret the '\' in '\0' as an escape, so it renders this
as "'0' terminated". If you write this with the ``...`` for fixed-width
text:
    make it look like a string is ``\0`` terminated
then Sphinx will output the backslash as a literal in the output.

This does not seem to render as a nested table.

Probably the simplest thing is to use the "::" syntax to
keep this as ASCII art, similar to the way you've handled
the other fixed-width tables in this document.

You could put ``(x = refcount_bits - 1)`` to make the code fragment
