This results in a "stair case" effect where each successive row is offset to the right by a handful of pixels. I believe this is related to the fact that the horizontal resolution only divisible by 2, not 16 which most others are.

There's a newer bug report here, but not real progress:

  https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/90

1366 is particularly problematic as it apparently can't be represented
exactly in EDID which needs a x8 multiple.

With regards,
Daniel
