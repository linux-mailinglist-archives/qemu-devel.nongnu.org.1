Hi Jamin,

Note that I had a typo in my reply that prompted this patch, this was
meant to be:

    s->pending =3D=3D 0

Same typo here now :)

    s->pending =3D=3D 1

So I think we can get away without the nested conditionals?

   if (FIELD_EX32(data, GPIO_INDEX_REG, INT_STATUS)) {
       /* pending is either 1 or 0 for a 1-bit field */
       pending =3D extract32(set->int_status, pin_idx, 1);
      =20
       /*
        * The assert is effectively a compressed form of
        *
        *     assert((s->pending =3D=3D 0 && pending =3D=3D 0) ||
        *            (s->pending >=3D 1));
        *
        * This seems reasonable.
        *
        * Another way to write it is:
        *
        *     assert(!pending || s->pending));
        */
       assert(s->pending >=3D pending);
  =20
       /* No change to s->pending if pending is 0 */
       s->pending -=3D pending;
  =20
       /*
        * The write acknowledged the interrupt regardless of whether it
        * was pending or not. The post-condition is that it mustn't be
        * pending. Unconditionally clear the status bit.
        */
       s->int_status =3D deposit32(set->int_status, pin_idx, 1, 0);
   }
  =20
Thoughts?

Up to you whether you keep the comments if the idea makes sense and you
choose to adopt it.
