Only part of the features.

Yes and no.

Probing through management seems to be better. For example it can
calculate the cluster in advance without the need to launch qemu
everywhere.

Or consider the case when USO is not supported by the kernel in the
destination, even if qemu reports this, I'm not sure what is expected
to be done in the management layer?
