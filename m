All excellent questions.

Emulating real interrupt controllers in the VM is probably impossible
in every scenario. But certainly x86 emulating x86 and ARM emulating
ARM would be usefully achievable.

hyperv did a neat thing where their remapping driver seems to make VMM
traps and looks kind of like the VMM gives it the platform specific
addr/data pair.

It is a big ugly problem for sure, and we definately have painted
ourselves into a corner where the OS has no idea if IMS techniques
work properly or it is broken. :( :(

But I think there may not be a terribly impossible path where at least
the guest could be offered a, say, virtio-irq in addition to the
existing platform controllers that would process IMS for it.

In many cases yes, it is, but more importantly it is the only sane way
to support these IMS like techniques broadly since IMS is by
definition not generally trappable.

I don't know, I fear not. But it keeps coming up. Too many things
don't work right with the trapping approach, including this.

I see, it seems to be assuming also that these extra interrupt sources
are generating the same MSI message as the main MSI, not something
else. That is more a SW quirk of Windows, I expect. I don't think
Linux would do that..

This is probably the only way to approach this, trap and emulate the
places in the device that program additional interrupt sources and do
a full MSI-like flow to set them up in the kernel.
