MemoryRegions used to "piggyback" on their owners instead of using their
own reference counters due to the circular dependencies between
them, which caused new circular references. Stop piggybacking, showing
that the circular dependencies are actually broken at the finalization
time.

Circular references caused by piggybacking
==========================================

Piggybacking created another circular reference when an owner referred
to its MemoryRegion via memory_region_ref(). This could happen in three
scenarios:

- A subregion and its container had the same owner. In this case, the
  container would use memory_region_ref() to take a reference to the
  subregion.

- An AddressSpace and its root MemoryRegion had the same owner. The
  situation is similar to the subregion/container scenario.

- An owner called address_space_map() with a guest-controlled address
  that points back to its MemoryRegion. This scenario is similar to what
  MemReentrancyGuard handles.

Avoiding such a circular reference required checking if the referrer is
the owner at many places where memory_region_ref() is called,
complicating the code further.

Insight
=======

This change challenges the underlying assumption that circular
dependencies exist and can be tolerated at the finalization time. The
deletable MemoryRegions are of hotpluggable devices and
virtio-gpu-virgl's hostmem. A device and its MemoryRegion have the
following dependencies:

QOM tree -> Device
Container -> MemoryRegion
Device <-> MemoryRegion

Techniques like piggybacking or a hypothetical garbage collector can
finalize the device and the MemoryRegion once the QOM tree and container
lose their dependencies. However, these methods are fundamentally
insufficient because the MemoryRegion and the device have finalizers,
and they do not respect the dependencies these objects may have during
finalization.

As long as the object model based on the device and the MemoryRegion is
correct, one of them should lose its dependency on the first,
establishing a valid finalization order. Understanding this allows using
standard reference counting, which is immune to the problems of
piggybacking.

Analysis reveals that the device no longer depends on the MemoryRegion
after being unparented. The device needs the MemoryRegion for the
following two purposes:
- To add the MemoryRegion to a container and expose it to an
  AddressSpace.
- To expose it via the QOM tree.

Once unparented, the device is hidden from the AddresSpaces and the
QOM tree so it no longer needs the MemoryRegion and the circular
dependencies are broken. We only need to ensure that the device is
finalized after the MemoryRegion then.

It should also be noted that the reference from the MemoryRegion to the
device needs to be tracked only after the device is unparented because
the device will not be finalized as long as it is in the QOM tree.
This fact can be exploited to avoid having a circular reference between
the device and the MemoryRegion before the device gets unparented.

Solution
========

When devices get unparented, they also unparent their memory regions.
The unparented memory regions will then retain their references to the
devices. This ensures that:

1. the references from the devices to their memory regions are counted
   until the devices get unparented
2. the references from their memory regions to the devices afterwards,
   which in turn ensures that devices are finalized after their
   MemoryRegions.

When virtio-gpu's hostmems get unparented, they also unparent their
memory regions in the same manner.

This enforces a valid finalization order, allows MemoryRegions to rely
on standard reference counting, and eliminates the entire class of
memory leaks caused by piggybacking.
