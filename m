The discard-no-unref option causes qemu to only zero the blocks/clusters 
that get discarded, but does NOT remove the reference of the cluster.
So the cluster stays allocated/referenced, but is just marked zero.

There are multiple scenario's where you would need this.
First of all when you have a pre-allocated image, you most likely 
created it because you don't want fragmentation.
But if you don't have discard-no-unref enabled, you will end up with a 
fragmented image anyway, because discard will create holes in your 
image, and will be randomly allocated. Ending up with a fragmented image.

Another scenario (and why we implemented it), is that with a sparse 
image, you allocate new blocks at the end of the 'allocation pointer' 
(which points to the first available blocks in your image).
But if you do discards, afaik the pointer is not moved to the freed 
cluster, but still allocates at the end until you reopen the image.
And even then, take you created a hole of 5 free clusters, and you need 
to allocate 4 new clusters, it will use those 5 and leave 1 empty cluster.
But the next allocation needs 2 clusters, it will jump to the next free 
space with at least 2 clusters. Leaving that 1 cluster unallocated.
And this caused us to have 'sparse' images of 110GB for 100GB images for 
example. Just because the qcow2 images was full of small empty clusters 
completely fragmented.
