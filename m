And actually, you can't make any assumptions from value of refcnt, as you don't know which additional parents were created and why, and when they are going unref their children.

Sounds good. I even don't see, why you need bdrv_chain_has_significant_parent() check. We just roll-back ro->rw transition on failure case, isn't just always correct thing to do?

Hmm, somehow, I don't have it in my mailbox, but here it is: https://patchew.org/QEMU/20240109093128.157460-1-alexander.ivanov@virtuozzo.com/

More: in commit message you say about failure case. And it seems OK to roll-back ro->rw transition on failure, if we did it. But mirror_exit_common() called on success path too. I think, on success patch, we should do any additional reopenings?
