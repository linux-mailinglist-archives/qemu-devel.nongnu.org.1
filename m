Oh interesting, I found how it does it..

The file avocado/plugins/assets.py will build an AST of the python
code in a test file, look for all 'fetch_asset' calls, then extract
the parameters to these calls, and donwload them. This is clever.
Basically avoids the refactoring that I suggested.

So yeah, that is a gap.

Practically speaking, we have a choice of either  calling into this
avocado python lib as is, or copying tthat python lib into QEMU.

Daniel
