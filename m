Fair enough.  Yes I could be over-cautious due to the previous experience
on managing all kinds of migration threads.

6 channels can be a bit less in this test case with 4 VFs, but indeed
adding such dependency on number of multifd threads isn't as good either, I
agree.  I'm ok as long as VFIO reviewers are fine.

Yes, if you want to use separate thread it'll be great to match on the src
thread model with similar pool.  I hope the pool interface you have is
easily applicable on both sides.
