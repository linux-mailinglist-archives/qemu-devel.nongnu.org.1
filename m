Only the setups are buggy that might meet this.

Are you suggesting to fix the management? E.g patching libvirt to
probe tap features?

We can define a set of TAP features as well, but I'm not sure it's
worthwhile to do this.

Using Qemu might be problematic as usually it doesn't not have privilege.

We can extend iproute, or a dedicated tool or ask libvirt to do this.
If libvirt could do the probe by itself, could we start from that?
