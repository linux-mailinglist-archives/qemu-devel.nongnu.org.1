Thanks Fabiano.

Since I'm preparing the old series to post for some fundamental cleanups
around multifd, and when I'm looking around the code, I noticed that
_maybe_ it'll also be eaiser to apply such a series if we can cleanup more
things then move towards a clean base to add more accelerators.

I agree many ideas in your this series, but I may address it slightly
different (e.g., I want to avoid send(), but you can consider that in the
fixed-ram series instead), also it'll be after some other cleanup I plan to
give a stab at which is not yet covered in this series.  I hope I can add
your "Co-developed-by" in some of the patches there.  If you haven't spend
more time on new version of this series, please wait 1-2 days so I can post
my thoughts.
