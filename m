IIUC, we run the migration-test  qtest for *every* softmmu target.

So, assuming you're referring to alpha guest, we were already
exercising it.

The migration qtest as it exists today is pushing the boundaries of
what a qtest is. I'd actually call the migration qtest a functional
test that happens to use the qtest framework for historical reasons.

The only slight thing that makes it not a functional test is that it
is using a specialized guest, which is just the custom boot sector
that dirties ram.

A true migration functional test is conceptually interesting, as we
have had bugs in the past which only hit when using real guest OS
in certain ways. The trouble is that worst bugs have been pretty
niche, such that its unlikely we would have pre-empatively have
a test combination that would have hit them.


Anyway, I think a true functional test for migration is relevant
to keep, as long as we make it clearly different from the qtest.
A simple smoke test using a real Linux guest is different enough
from our hand crafted boot sector that I think it is valuable
coverage. Even better if we make the functional test add *lots*
of different devices.

With regards,
Daniel
