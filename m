There is a reason for running in the context associated with the BB: the
virtio-scsi code assumes all request processing happens in the BB's
AioContext. The SCSI request list and other SCSI emulation code is not
thread-safe!

The invariant is that SCSI request processing must only happen in one
AioContext. Other parts of QEMU may perform block I/O from other
AioContexts because they don't run SCSI emulation for this device.
