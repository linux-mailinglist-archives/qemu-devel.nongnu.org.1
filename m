Yes, swap can alleviate the issue of insufficient system memory, but it 
can also affect performance. Additionally, some systems may disable the 
swap function for various reasons, making it unavailable for use

Based on the test results, QEMU generally allocates a lot of memory
when handling backend I/O, and this memory can be released when the
virtual machineâ€™s storage I/O is idle.

Based on this observation, management tools can monitor the storage I/O
load of virtual machines. If the storage I/O load of a virtual machine
remains low for a certain period, the tool can use this interface to
return most of the allocatable memory to the operating system.

According to our statistics, this approach can save at least 150MB of
system memory per virtual machine on average.

During the lifecycle of the virtual machine, this part of the logic
may not be triggered, so we plan to add a new interface.
