Maybe there is no real bugs to fix. We don't allocate these devices other 
than creating it once in the beginning with the machine that lives 
throughout the QEMU session. So plugging memory leaks is only to silence 
some analysers that complain about this but it won't fix any real bug. 
It's still good to silence the warnings which may even lead to failed 
compilation with some compilers.

I already said that my problem with your approach is that it relies on 
confusing rules for using gpio outs and gpio ins (one would need to be 
connected before realize and the other one after). I think qemu_irq is 
already a confusing part of QEMU hiding a pointer, qemu_gpio adds another 
level of complexity to thar and adding more rules making it inconsistent 
and behave differently in hard to remember ways is too much for anybody to 
use it correctly. So instead of making this more complex for users and 
changing all the call sites, it's better to fix it at the root and allow 
users to simply use it. Currently closest to the root is within vt82c686 
as i8259 isn't yet completely QDev-ified (some very old code that is used 
by a lot of other devices like i8259 is still pre QDev using legacy init).

The qemu_gpio is a QDev thing and QDev is meant to model devices so they 
can eventually be combined into a machine without board code just using a 
declarative description. So gpios should be used for outside facing pins 
of the device and it's more intuitive to connect these pins after the 
device is realized than to connect some of them before realize and some of 
them after. Using gpio for internal connections just because it's freed 
with the device is also wrong. For that embedding qemu_irq would be the 
way that's currently used for similar cases of one device internally using 
another (like SoCs). (I have a problem with embedding devices too as that 
exposes their state struct and thus implementation details outside of 
object implementation but that's another issue. Maybe the best solution 
would be creating resources and objects as children of the device so it 
would be freed with the device but some of these can be used outside of 
the device so then those places would need to reatain/release or ref/unref 
them which we likely forget to do so it would break either way.)
