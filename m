On s390x the use of the MIO instructions is limited to only PCI access. 
So i am not sure if we should generically apply this to all vfio mmap 
access (for non PCI devices).

AFAICT in qemu today the ram_device_mem_ops is used for non PCI vfio 
mmap cases. For s390x these helpers should be restricted to PCI 
accesses. For the unaligned accesses (thanks for pointing out that 
commmit!), are you suggesting we use the ld*_he_p/st*_he_p functions in 
the helpers i defined? Though those functions don't seem to be doing 
volatile accesses.

Thanks

Farhan
