I may indeed just do that... though we still need to solve "where to put
the ifcond data?" question. The documentation culling also must be held
back in this case too, which I am fine with.

It turns out this happens in the "example" doc patch, it's just a setting
in index.rst. I didn't even intend to commit that patch anyway. So this is
a nothing-burger.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Below, I&#39;m going to try a new communication approach wher=

&gt;&gt; &gt; if I have added something to my tasklist or not so that it&#3=

&gt;&gt; &gt; what I believe is actionable (and what I am agreeing to chang=

&gt;&gt; &gt; believe needs stronger input from you before I do anything. A=
pologies if it<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; seems a little robotic, just trying new things O:-)<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; On that note: not added to tasklist: do we need the LaTeX han=
dler? Do we<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; need any others? Please confirm O:-)<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; See above.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I&#39;ve got html and text working, text wasn&#39;t hard. I will give =
it a good<br>
&gt; college try on the LaTeX and man formats. Might be easy. The issue her=
e is<br>
&gt; the custom node I introduced for the collapsible details sections whic=
h has<br>
&gt; no default handler in the generators. I&#39;ll have to learn more abou=
t that<br>
&gt; part of the API, I haven&#39;t interfaced with it much yet.<br>
<br>
Understand.<br>
<br>
Have you considered cutting the series in half before the inliner?<br>
First part emits &quot;The members of ...&quot; like the old doc generator.=
<br>
Second part replaces that with inlined material.<br>
<br>
We could totally release with just the first half!=C2=A0 Inlining is great,=

usable.<br></blockquote><div><br></div><div>I may indeed just do that... th=

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Right. I debated making the members references to that class,=
 but recalled<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; that you disliked this class and figured you&#39;d not like s=
uch a change, so I<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; just left it alone. I do not have cross-references for indivi=
dual members<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; of objects at all yet anyway, so this is definitely more work=
 regardless.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; We could always create a pragma of some sort (or just hardcod=
e a list) of<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; items that must be documented regardless of if they&#39;re re=
ferenced or not.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Please let me know your preference and I will add a &quot;tic=

&gt;&gt; &gt; tasklist for this project to handle that at /some point/. Not=
hing added to<br>

<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The new doc&#39;s headings use &quot;Struct&quot; or &quo=
t;Union&quot; where the old one uses<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; just &quot;Object&quot;.=C2=A0 Let&#39;s keep &quot;Objec=
t&quot;, please.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I was afraid you&#39;d ask for this. OK, I think it&#39;s an =
easy change. Can I<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; keep the index page segmented by object type still, though?<b=
r>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I do find knowing the *type* of object to be helpful as a dev=
eloper,<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Can you explain why and how struct vs. union matters to you as a<b=
r>
&gt;&gt; developer?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I suppose it&#39;s just internal details that I like to know, but tend=
 to find<br>
&gt; the HTML reference easier to work with than grepping through the qapi<=
br>
&gt; files. I&#39;m gonna change it for you anyway because I agree it&#39;s=
 not<br>
&gt; consistent with the philosophy of &quot;end user QMP reference&quot;. =
Just feels like<br>
&gt; a tiny shame somehow.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; though<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I understand that from the point of view of a QMP user, they&=
#39;re all just<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; objects, so your request makes sense.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;d prefer a single index.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; So ... structs, unions, alternates all condensed down to &quot;Object&=
quot;, is that<br>
&gt; right? We get to keep command/enum/event separate, I assume.<br>
<br>
No, only structs and unions are &quot;Object&quot;, alternates are &quot;Al=
ternate&quot;.<br>
<br>
For me, the separation between struct and union is an unfortunate<br>
remnant of somewhat winding development history.<br>
<br>
A union is has common members, one of them is the tag, and for each tag<br>
value, it may have variant members.<br>
<br>
A struct is a degenerate union: no variants.<br>
<br>
This is as old as the hills: Pascal records are just like this.<br>
<br>
QMP introspection doesn&#39;t show structs and unions, just objects, which<=
br>
may or may not have variants.<br>
<br>
The schema language syntax, however, is still rooted (stuck?) in a past<br>
when unions could not have common members other than the tag.<br></blockquo=

it&#39;s code in the<br>

&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; ACK<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;ll try to make up my mind :)<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I should also point out, this is an issue in the domain and not the<br=

&gt; generator; the generated rst document doesn&#39;t have this duplicatio=
n. So<br>
&gt; it&#39;s kind of a no-op while we look and consider this specific seri=

&gt; it&#39;s still on my list when we go to look at the predecessor series=
