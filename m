That would mean this endianness in ops should be set when the memory 
region is mapped in the machine not when defining the device. So all 
device ops should really be NATIVE_ENDIAN and only assigned an endianness 
when they are mapped based on the machine/bus/cpu they are connected to.

Yes, I've oversimpified, each ops has its own endianness config not the 
device. But since the endianness is not a property of the device or its 
regions but the bus it's connected to, this config switch may be at the 
wrong place now.

That answers my question. Then it seems it's not so simple to set 
endianness when the device is mapped because it would need to be done 
somewhere else. It may still be possible but might be too much work to 
find it out.

It could copy the MemoryRegionOps when needed but seems it's not 
memory_region_init_io that would need to handle that. Given the current 
way it's implemented doubling the ops region may be the simplest even if 
not the correct way to do it so it's OK if there's no simple alternative 
that's more correct.

I think so as I've described above but not enough to try to solve it so 
I'm OK with Philippe's series if there's no other way to make it less like 
a workaround for something that could be done clearer. Looks like other 
way might be too complex for now.
