I understand (1).  Why (2)/(3) are causes of circular references?

Yes, they need to "reference" each other.  That's also why IMHO the current
qemu mr refcounting design is still practical, in that it keeps the
reference graph to be acyclic, which is much simpler to understand.

What if the owner is not a device?

If we have a more self contained solution [1], which do not care about the
type of the owner object, why bother?

What is the benefit of your proposal here, comparing to [1]?

It's definitely not obvious why a memory core change will involve a GPU
change too.

I think this is wrong.  This should break object_new(TYPE_MEMORY_REGION)
users.
