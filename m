Sure, I can keep it to just v8.3.

On capitalization, I don't feel strongly about it, I just followed this
commit[1], which explained that the rebranding changed "ARM" to "Arm":

    6fe6d6c9a95 (docs: Be consistent about capitalization of 'Arm',
    2020-03-09)

That's why I went with it.  I see you know this by your "distant past"
remark :)  To match the above, I'll keep the capitalization to "Arm".

Yeah, I thought about it but I was not sure if it's the right place.  As
you point out, there's a live-migration impact depending on the level of
PAuth support, so mentioning these details will be useful.

I'll come up with something for v2.  Thanks for looking!
