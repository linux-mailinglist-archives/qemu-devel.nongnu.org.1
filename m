per my knowledge firmware is out of picture here, since all
it does in HEST case is allocate continuous space for
'etc/hardware_errors' blob as QEMU told it.

maybe to get moving, 1st get your series in with docs fixed
to today limit.
And then increase error_block size to desired value on top of that
as it's really not relevant to what you are doing here.
