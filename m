It's not really clear though what extensions are good to have. Other
people might think differently about the extensions. It also then
means we end up with complex combinations of extensions to manage.

I do feel a separate flag is better than trying to guess what extra
extensions the user wants enabled.

I don't love either though, isn't this what profiles is supposed to fix!

At that point they can use the max CPU or just manually enable the
extensions though.
