If memory serves, there were other issues recently where older versions of Sphinx behaved differently from newer versions, causing intermittent failures that were hard to track down.

I guess this relates to pythondeps.toml line

    sphinx = { accepted = ">=3.4.3", installed = "5.3.0", canary = "sphinx-build" }

I further guess "accepted" means "reject anything older", and
"installed" means "preferred version".

Purely offline, or not?

> ... I think I value this a bit higher than Markus, but not really because of offline builds.  Rather, keeping the "accepted" key lower (i.e. supporting the packaged sphinx on a wide range of distros) makes it easier to bump the "installed" key when needed, as in this failure to run 5.3.0 under Python 3.13.

Showing my ignorance again...  I don't understand how keeping "accepted"
lower helps.

> This time there was a version that works on both the oldest and newest Python that we support, but there may not always be one because sphinx is all too happy at dropping support for EOL'd versions of Python.

Pretty strong hint we shouldn't try to support EOL'd versions of Python
either.
