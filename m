I completed the review pass on my end. I strongly encourage you to move
the series into a non RFC series to attract more reviewers. Migration
needs to be fixed and compat handling as well I think but overall the
nested support looks mostly OK for me. Some stuff are a bit hacky (like
config local patching to force S2 only) as I mentionned in my comments
but let see if other reviewers find some more elegant ways to handle things
