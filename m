I keep confusing BdrvChild and BlockDriverState, sorry.

Talking in general about Rust and not QEMU, if you wanted to be able to
optionally store the mapping, and not always modify the refcount, you'd
probably want an &Arc<T>. Then you only clone it if needed for the cache
(for example if you cached the *content* rather than the mapping, you
wouldn't need to clone).

However, Arc doesn't work here. In order to globally invalidate all cached
mappings, you would need the cache to store something similar to a Weak<T>.
But even that doesn't quite work, because if you passed an &Arc the caller
could clone it as it wished. So using weak clones to do cache invalidation
shows as the hack that it is.

Going back to QEMU, the Mapping needs some smart pointer (something that
implements Deref<Target =3D bindings;:BdrvChild>), which does implement som=
e
reference counting unlike the C version but, unlike &Arc<BdrvChild>, cannot
be cloned willy nilly. Instead it can be 1) weakly-cloned under the graph
rdlock 2) used from a weak reference but only for the duration of an rdlock
critical section (no way to make it strong for an arbitrary lifetime!) 3)
invalidated under the graph wrlock.

The nice thing here is that, even if you have a good way to invalidate the
cache, that's orthogonal to how you make the Rust API memory safe. Cache
invalidation becomes just a way to quickly free the BdrvChild=E2=80=94the i=
nvalid
entry would be detected anyway later when trying to use the weak reference.

More practical/immediate suggestion below...

You're right, I always forget the new BdrvChild world.

Arc<BdrvChild> poses another problem then, in that graph changes would
invalidate the raw pointer even if the Arc is still alive. Something like
the aforementioned smart pointer would prevent the cache from accessing a
dead pointer (at the cost of adding a refcount field to BdrvChild that C
doesn't use).

But for now maybe you can just rename the *mut-wrapping BdrvChild to
BdrvChildRef, get rid of Arc, and store an &BdrvChildRef into Mapping? Then
if you ever decide to go with the refcounting plan you can implement Deref.

Right.

There is no mutable part in BochsImage, which makes this easy. [...] But if

Yes, I mentioned RefCell because of the iothread case but I agree it also
isn't right. It wouldn't panic when you have more than one request in
flight however, as long as only map() needs to borrow_mut(). If instead you
need slightly more complex locking, for example similar to the vbox driver,
you need CoMutex/CoRwLock bindings.

Well, you don't *have* to have two. In this case I suggested two just
because the C and Rust APIs are completely different. But also...

... this is just "?" in Rust and it's the C/Rust boundary that complicates
things, because "?" assumes that you return another Result. So the
two-function idea helps because the inner function can just use "?", and
the outer one qemu_api::errno. It let's you use the language more
effectively. &dyn is just an addition on top.

If needed your inner function could return Result<T, Errno> instead of
Result<T, io::Error>, too. That works nicely because "?" would also convert
io::Error into Errno as needed.

But if you don't want the two functions, why wouldn't you just do "e =3D>
..." in the match statement instead of Err(e)?

While it would<br>
&gt; be possible to use a trait, I wrote the API thinking of minimal glue<b=

&gt; code that only does the C&lt;-&gt;Rust conversion.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; In this case, because you have a lot more code than just a call into<b=

&gt; the BlockDriver trait, you&#39;d have something like<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; fn bdrv_co_preadv_part(<br>

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0flags: bindings::BdrvRequestFlags) -&gt; io::Result=
&lt;()&gt;<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; and then a wrapper (e.g. rust_co_preadv_part?) that only does<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 let s =3D unsafe { &amp;mut *((*bs).opaque as *mut D) };<=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 errno::into_negative_errno(result)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; This by the way has also code size benefits because &amp;dyn, unlike<b=

This one is part of a Result, too. But not a result that is directly<br>
