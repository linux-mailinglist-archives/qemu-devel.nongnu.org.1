I think -machine m68k:virt could work, -M help would list machines like:

arm:raspi
i386:pc
etc.

Management apps could easily find : to separate arch but those that don't 
care about arch would just work and list more possible machines. Some 
machines like pc or mac99 that may appear differently in different single 
arch binary might need to get resolved first. Maybe need a way to search 
machine list by pattern e.g. as -machine x86_64:help.

I tend to agree with Peter that if a multi binary qemu-system-arm would be 
able to also create the 64 bit machines that's not a problem as long as 
all the 32 bit machines still work the same. This would just make 
qemu-system-arm and qemu-system-aarch64 the same or maybe you can set the 
search pattern from command name so qemu-system-arm -M help would be the 
same as qemu-system -M arm:help.

Allowing renaming binaries and still keep single arch behaviour probably 
needs to keep a way to build single arch binaries so you can't convert 
everything to runtime check and drop #ifdefs.
