Kind of.

Previously, the whole command would be tagged for TARGET_S390X
so the command was not available at all.

Now its always  available, but may return an error at runtime
for some targets.

Since we're not providing any mechanism for apps to detect
which targets will work and which won't, the implication
is that apps are expected to try it if they need it, and
cope with any error.

From that POV I thought it might be better not to call
out a point-in-time limitation of the impl. I'm not too
fussed either way though, so we could re-instate the
note.

Likewise
