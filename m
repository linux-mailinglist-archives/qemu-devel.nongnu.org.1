Lets put it aside for now and revisit it later, so that we can focus on
the conversion from the CPU type name to the CPU model name for now.

It's true that '-cpu input' gets lost in these cases. However, the CPU type
name instead of the CPU model name is printed in the error message when the
CPU type is validated in hw/core/machine.c::machine_run_board_init(). It looks
good to me to print the CPU type name instead of the model name there.

Another error message is printed when the CPU model specified in '-cpu input'
isn't valid. The CPU model has been printed and it looks good either.

   # qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt -cpu aaa
   qemu-system-aarch64: unable to find CPU model 'aaa'

Are there other cases I missed where we need to print the CPU model name, which
is specified by user through '-cpu input'?

Ok. Thanks for your confirm.

Thanks for the advice. I think it's enough for now since the CPU type
invalidation is currently done for arm/mips/riscv for now. On these
targets, the CPU type name is always the combination of the CPU model
name and suffix. I will add helper qemu/cpu.c::cpu_model_by_name()
as you suggested. Note that, the suffix can be gained by ("-" CPU_RESOLVING_TYPE)

Yes, the newly added helper cpu_model_by_name() needs to be applied
to targets where query_cpu_definitions and cpu_list are defined.

Thanks,
Gavin
