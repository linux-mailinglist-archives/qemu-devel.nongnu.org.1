I didn=E2=80=99t test anything on the stable branch for now but only on =
Canary so far.=20
Just cursorily tested (EDK2 only) an X Elite device on prod (26100.4652) =
and this issue doesn=E2=80=99t appear.

I have 8cx Gen 3 and 8cx Gen 1 (SQ1) devices around, will test on those =
older SoCs later and see.

Random idea for testing: what if you put -M highmem=3Doff, does that =
change anything?

Thanks,
