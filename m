I'm more amenable to this example being in scope of machine types. The
most important use case for machine types, by a mile, is to ensure that
live migration works between 2 QEMUs. Having a stable guest ABI does
have other use cases like ensuring Windows doesn't trigger license
(re-)activation, but live migration is the important one. It is
unfortunate that the object id leaked into the migration stream but
this was a reasonable (hack) workaround to address it.

Ok, yes, this compat props usage that's independent of machine
type is fine.

The appealing thing about machine types is that it is an opaque
collection of properties. The mgmt app does not need to know about
any of the properties being set, it can just let the machine type
do its magic.

Probing values for individual features which are supported on a host
means mgmt apps need to be made aware of all the properties that are
affected, and keep track of them for the life of the VM. This is a
significantly higher burden for the mgmt app to deal with that the
opaque collection machine types define, especially because apps won't
know ahead of time which objects/properties might need this facility
in future.

With regards,
Daniel
