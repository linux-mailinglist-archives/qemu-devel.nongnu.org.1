I wonder if just casting to (void) without assigning to a value could 
avoid the warning? In that case you would not need a macro just

(void)AUD_register_card("OMAP EAC", &s->codec.card, &error_fatal);

Not sure it's clearer than a macro which states what it does but the 
definition is a bit cryptic while this cast is simpler but may also puzzle 
somebody not familiar with it.
