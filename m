As far as I understand (correct me if I'm wrong), but this feature must 
be implemented in device itself (along with inflight field location) or 
in some base class for vhost-user devices. For now vhost-user-blkdoesn't 
have one yet.The closest base class that i could find is 
vhost-user-base, but for using it, it has to implement all 
device-agnostic code from vhost-user-blk, and don't break all existing 
vhost-user-base derived devices. For example, to support inflight 
migration in base class, there first need to implement inflight field in 
it, along with the reconnect feature. Then, with a big refactor, somehow 
inherit vhost-user-blk from it, along with other devices such as 
vhost-user-fs.

So, IMO it looks like a whole separate track that will need to be tackled.

Yea, but i think, i just need to perform inflight migration only when 
some non-local migration flag is set.

And i think, Vladimir's series already have that flag.


Thanks for the comments!

Hi!

During inter-host migration, waiting for disk requests to be drained
in the vhost-user backend can incur significant downtime.

This can be avoided if QEMU migrates the inflight region in vhost-user-blk.
Thus, during the qemu migration, the vhost-user backend can cancel all inflight requests and
then, after migration, they will be executed on another host.

At first, I tried to implement migration for all vhost-user devices that support inflight at once,
but this would require a lot of changes both in vhost-user-blk (to transfer it to the base class) and
in the vhost-user-base base class (inflight implementation and remodeling + a large refactor).
