IIRC, we had a discussion on this topic sometime last year, but can't
remember what the $SUBJECT was, so I'll just repeat what I said then.

Combining C99 mixed declarations with 'goto' is dangerous.

Consider this program:

$ cat jump.c
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char**argv) {

  if (getenv("SKIP"))
    goto target;

  char *foo = malloc(30);

 target:
  free(foo);
}

$ gcc -Wall -Wuninitialized -o jump jump.c

$ SKIP=1 ./jump 
free(): invalid pointer
Aborted (core dumped)


 -> The programmer thinks they have initialized 'foo'
 -> GCC thinks the programmer has initialized 'foo'
 -> Yet 'foo' is not guaranteed to be initialized at 'target:'

Given that QEMU makes heavy use of 'goto', allowing C99 mixed
declarations exposes us to significant danger.

Full disclosure, GCC fails to diagnmose this mistake, even
with a decl at start of 'main', but at least the mistake is
now more visible to the programmer.

Fortunately with -fanalyzer GCC can diagnose this:

$ gcc -fanalyzer -Wall -o jump jump.c
jump.c: In function ‘main’:
jump.c:12:3: warning: use of uninitialized value ‘foo’ [CWE-457] [-Wanalyzer-use-of-uninitialized-value]
   12 |   free(foo);
      |   ^~~~~~~~~
  ‘main’: events 1-5
    |
    |    6 |   if (getenv("SKIP"))
    |      |      ~  
    |      |      |
    |      |      (3) following ‘true’ branch...
    |    7 |     goto target;
    |      |     ~~~~
    |      |     |
    |      |     (4) ...to here
    |    8 | 
    |    9 |  char *foo = malloc(30);
    |      |        ^~~
    |      |        |
    |      |        (1) region created on stack here
    |      |        (2) capacity: 8 bytes
    |......
    |   12 |   free(foo);
    |      |   ~~~~~~~~~
    |      |   |
    |      |   (5) use of uninitialized value ‘foo’ here


...but -fanalyzer isn't something we have enabled by default, it
is opt-in. I'm also not sure how comprehensive the flow control
analysis of -fanalyzer is ?  Can we be sure it'll catch these
mistakes in large complex functions with many code paths ?

Even if the compiler does reliably warn, I think the code pattern
remains misleading to contributors, as the flow control flaw is
very non-obvious.

Rather than accept the status quo and remove the coding guideline,
I think we should strengthen the guidelines, such that it is
explicitly forbidden in any method that uses 'goto'. Personally
I'd go all the way to -Werror=declaration-after-statement, as
while C99 mixed decl is appealing, it isn't exactly a game
changer in improving code maintainability.
