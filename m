QEMU defaults num_queues to the number of present CPUs. A management
tool that wants to ensure that all hotplugged CPUs will have their own
virtqueues must set num_queues to max_cpus instead. This wastes
resources upfront but in theory the guest can operate efficiently. I
haven't checked the Linux guest drivers to see if they actually handle
virtqueue allocation after hotplug. The Linux drivers vary in how they
allocate virtqueue interrupts, so be sure to check several device
types like virtio-net and virtio-blk as they may behave differently.

Or the management tool can explicitly set num_queues to the number of
present CPUs and preserve that across live migration and CPU hotplug.
In that case num_queues can be updated across guest cold boot in order
to (eventually) achieve the optimal multi-queue configuration.

Other approaches might be possible too. The management tool has a
choice of how to implement this and QEMU doesn't dictate a specific
approach.
