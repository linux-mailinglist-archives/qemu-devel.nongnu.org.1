The flipside is that the semantics & limits we want for convergance
are already known to be different from what we wanted for pre-copy
and post-copy. With that existing practice, it is probably more
likely that we would not want to re-use the same setting for different
cases, which makes me think a specifically targetted parameter is
better.
