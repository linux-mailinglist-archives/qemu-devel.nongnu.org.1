Two existing ways to add comments that don't go into generated
documentation:

1. Write a non-doc comment.

   ##
   # This is a doc comment.
   ##

   #
   # This isn't.
   #

2. TODO sections in a doc comment.

Not sure we need more ways, but if we do, we'll create them.

But where exactly does it go?

The question applies not just to tagged sections such as "Note:", but to
argument, member, and feature descriptions, too.

Our current answer for argument / member descriptions is "right after
the body section".  Works because we permit only the body section before
argument / member descriptions .  Pretty arbitrary restriction, though.

Fine print: can be a bit more complicated for unions, but let's ignore
that here.

I guess our current answer for feature descriptions is something like
"right after argument / member descriptions if they exist, else right
after the body section".

What could our answer be for other sections?

In my experience, the people writing the doc comments rarely check how
they come out in generated documentation.

The closer the doc comments are to the generated documentation, the
higher the chance it comes out as intended.

The more complex the inlining gets, the higher the chance of mishaps.

If cases of complex inlining are rare, we could sidestep complex
inlining by inlining manually.

If that's undesirable or impractical, we could require explicit
instructions where the inlined material should go.

I'm merely thinking aloud; these are certainly not requests, just ideas,
and possibly bad ones.

Yes.
