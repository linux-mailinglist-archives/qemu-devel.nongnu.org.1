Hi,

Thank you for your reply.

After re-reading the linked articles, I think I have got some more
clarity. One confusion was related to the difference between vdpa
and vhost-vdpa.

So far what I have understood is that L0 acts as the host and L1
acts as the guest in this setup. I understand that the guest can't
see the vDPA device.

I now also understand that vdpa_sim is not a PCI device. I am also
under the impression that vdpa refers to the vdpa bus while
vhost-vdpa is the device. Is my understanding correct?

After running the commands in the blog [1], I see that there's a
vhost-vdpa-0 device under /dev.

I also have an entry "vdpa0" under /sys/bus/vdpa/devices/ which
is a symlink to /sys/devices/vdpa0. There's a dir "vhost-vdpa-0"
under "/sys/devices/vdpa0". Hypothetically, if vhost-vdpa-0 had
been a PCI device, then it would have been present under
/sys/bus/pci/devices, right?

Another source of confusion was the pci.0 option passed to the
qemu-kvm command. But I have understood this as well now:
"-device virtio-net-pci" is a pci device.

I just realized I had the wrong version of kernel-modules-internal
installed. It works after installing the right version.
