Oh, that's interesting to see a ordering scenario that isn't related
to the PROP_ARRAY stuff we already identified.

Right now you can have arbitrary ordering of CPU feature groups and
individual features, with both on/off. Historically you could even have
the same feature name repeated with different on/off values and the last
occurrance would "win". This is incredibly flexible, but I think we could
argue this level of flexibility is overkill in practice for 99% of QEMU
deployments.

If we were to define two semantic rules for CPU specification:

  * All feature groups are processed before individiual features
  * A given feature group name or individual feature name may
    only appear once.

That would allow you to provide an implementation whose semantics
are not sensitive to the ordering of parameters, while still keeping
sufficient flexibility for all typical real world use cases.

The only thing I see lacking here is that it prevents users from doing
a "quick hack" of blindly appending  "foo=off" to an existing -cpu
argument - they would have to first check if 'foo' already appeared
in the existing -cpu arg and modify it in place. IMHO that's an
acceptable loss

With regards,
Daniel
