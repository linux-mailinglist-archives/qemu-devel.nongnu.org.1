I think I see where you're getting at, but I just have a few clarifying 
questions about your proposal here.

So you're proposing to add entries to used_elems at virtqueue_pop, ok.

avail_idx = 10, then the driver makes some new entries (elems) available 
in the avail ring:

used_elems[10] = elem0
used_elems[11] = elem1
used_elems[12] = elem2

At this point, avail_idx = 13, used_idx = 10.

elem1 gets used first, ok.

Now, if I'm understanding correctly, you're saying that in 
virtqueue_push explicitly (not virtqueue_fill/virtqueue_flush), we scan 
used_elems[used_idx] - used_elems[avail_idx] to find used_elems[i].index 
== elem->index and mark it as used, e.g. used_elems[i].used = true. 
Okay, now used_elems[11] has been marked as used.

Now we make it to virtqueue_fill. What's the role you want 
virtqueue_fill to take here (if any)?

You say that after we mark this element as used, we go to 
virtqueue_flush and scan for used elements in used_elems[used_idx] - 
used_elems[avail_idx]. Of course, the first one of this order will be in 
used_elems[used_idx], which is currently showing the element as unused, 
so we're done with this element for now.

So, what exactly is the role of virtqueue_flush here? I'm inferring here 
that you want the virtqueue_flush role (for split VQs) to do both the 
writing to the used ring (normally done in virtqueue_fill) as well as 
updating the used_idx (normally done in virtqueue_flush). Is this correct?

Next, elem0 gets used second.

Again, in virtqueue_push we scan scan used_elems[used_idx] - 
used_elems[avail_idx] to find used_elems[i].index == elem->index and 
mark it as used. Okay, used_elems[10] has been marked as used.

Then you say, "It is the first one in the used_elems[used_idx] - 
used_elems[avail_idx] range, so we can write it to the used ring at 
fill. used_idx++. We use the rest of the descriptor until we find one in 
used_elems that is not used, which is used_elems[12]."

This, to me, sounds like "in virtqueue_fill, when we find an order (e.g. 
used_elems[used_idx].index == elem->index) write it to the used ring AND 
increment the used_idx. Keep writing elements to the used ring if 
used_elems[used_idx].used == true and, for each element being written, 
incremented used_idx."

This is a bit confusing to me since next you say "After that, 
virtqueue_flush is called. At its scanning, used_elems[10] is used, so 
it writes it to the used ring. After that, used_elems[11] is also used, 
so it is written also. used_elems[12] is not used, so it stops there."

This sounds very similar to what you proposed for virtqueue_fill, except 
it looks like you're also saying to do this in virtqueue_flush, hence my 
confusion.

If you wouldn't mind, could you clarify the roles of virtqueue_fill and 
virtqueue_flush here for me? Thanks :)!

Just to be clear, for this series, you'd like me to implement a solution 
that does *not* consider the case where virtqueue_fill is called 
multiple times before virtqueue_flush (and to put a solution for this in 
a separate series)?

Are we not concerned that we might shoot ourselves in the foot here by 
implementing a process that may not work well for a batching solution, 
especially when we have an almost-working solution for batching and 
non-batching cases?

Ah, it does. My apologies, I should've recognized this would result in 
the device breaking.
