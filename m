I have wrote a bit about the expectation on the platform earlier[1], but 
let me summarize it here.

1. I expect the user will not downgrade the platform of hosts after 
setting up a VM. This is essential to enable any platform feature.

2. The user is allowed to upgrade the platform of hosts gradually. This 
results in a situation with mixed platforms. The oldest platform is 
still not older than the platform the VM is set up for. This enables the 
gradual deployment strategy.

3. the user is allowed to downgrade the platform of hosts to the version 
used when setting up the VM. This enables rollbacks in case of regression.

With these expectations, we can ensure migratability by a) enabling 
platform features available on all hosts when setting up the VM and b) 
saving the enabled features. This is covered with my 
-dump-platform/-merge-platform/-use-platform proposal[2].
