Hi Davidlohr,

We probably need to make this work like link width. That would push the control
to the downstream port side and effectively 'trains' the link (really simple negotiation
of capabilities). I don't think we care about more capable device plugged into
a less capable upstream port, so a simple property for the type 3 device (and switch USP)
should do the job.  If we want to do the optimized flits we'll need a little more.

So in short, make RP and downstream port always BI and 256bit flit capable, but
'fake' the training so if they are plugged into a EP or switch USP they report
whatever that was configured for. 

So alongside your hdm-db property in patch 2, have a 256bit-flit property.
Both of those have to apply for type 3 and the switch USP.
Then we sanity check the combination works (i.e. hdm-db only if 256 bit flit)

I think we need this fine grained control because we want to poke the corners
where only parts of the tree are BI capable.

So, precursor patch to enable 256bit flit mode then this stuff on top.

Jonathan
