For completeness here's the run on sam460ex Linux:

$ ./streamPPCpowerpcO3
-------------------------------------------------------------
Based on STREAM version $Revision: 5.10 $
-------------------------------------------------------------
This system uses 8 bytes per array element.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Array size = 10000000 (elements), Offset = 0 (elements)
Memory per array = 76.3 MiB (= 0.1 GiB).
Total memory required = 228.9 MiB (= 0.2 GiB).
Each kernel will be executed 10 times.
  The *best* time for each kernel (excluding the first iteration)
  will be used to compute the reported bandwidth.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Your clock granularity/precision appears to be 2 microseconds.
Each test below will take on the order of 169662 microseconds.
    (= 84831 clock ticks)
Increase the size of the arrays if this shows that
you are not getting at least 20 clock ticks per test.
-------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING -- The above is only a rough guideline.
For best results, please be sure you know the
precision of your system timer.

Also it's not something that broke recently and thus could be bisected. I 
get the same validation error with QEMU v8.2.0 before any embedded tlb 
changes or even before that so it may be something pre existing and then 
not related to the MorphOS boot problem above.
