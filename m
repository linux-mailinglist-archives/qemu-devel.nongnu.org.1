I'll fix all things until here (including Clement's suggestions in the
other email).

IIUC there can be one, or more than one MRs as children.  The finalize() of
this MR should release the rest refcounts for all of them if applicable.

Latest version of this paragraph looks like this now:

     * (2) mr->subregions non-empty, which means this MR is a container of
     *     one or more other MRs (which might have the the owner as this
     *     MR, or a different owner).

If above looks good I'll go ahead and merge this patch with the fixups.

Thanks a lot to both for the careful reviews (and tests).
