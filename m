Using QEMU from git suddenly requires upgrading the kernel or figuring
out obscure flags? Ugh.

Well with this first step we have successfully blamed the user and
the second step won't ever be taken.

the reason it kinda works with CPU cluster is simply because
there is a final set of CPU models and you can not easily
switch your CPU to a different model.

Yes but QEMU currently gives management no tools to figure out
what is important for it.
