Mea culpa. I can write more at length if we agree on the general approach.
For now, you got an RFC as this was the subject of a considerable amount of
controversy between us in the past ... so I am doing baby steps.

"Commit message needs to be hit with the unterseification beam" added to
tasklist. :)

Yes, this is all correct so far.

I'm leaving that question to you. The calculus I made was that there were
fewer SLOC changes to explicitly denote the "Details:" sections only in the
handful of cases where it was (potentially) relevant than to mandate its
use unconditionally. If you have an idea that is enforceable at runtime and
has fewer SLOC changes, suggest away!

Unseen in this patch is a warning I added to the /inliner/ that identified
potentially "ambiguous" delineation spots and issued a warning (error); the
exact code that did this is possibly a little hokey but it was what I used
to identify the spots addressed by this patch.

Point being: it's possible to enforce, but I enforced it in qapidoc.py in
the inliner instead of directly in the parser. We could discuss moving the
check to the parser if you'd like. The check itself is somewhat "dumb":

- If a doc block has only one *paragraph* (knowingly/intentionally not
using the term section here) of text, it's assumed to be the intro.
- If a doc block has any number of tagged sections, all text above (if any)
is assumed to be the "intro" and all text below (if any) is assumed to be
"details".

It's only in this case that it whines:

- A doc block has *multiple paragraphs* of text at the start of the block,
but has no other sections and so if there is semantically a "details"
section or not is unclear to the parser and inliner.

The check as I wrote it is unintelligent in that it does not bother to
check if the doc block it is checking is ever one that *could* be inlined;
i.e. it will complain about being unable to delineate for commands -- even
though it wouldn't really matter in that case. It's a potential improvement
to the algorithm to ignore cases where that "ambiguity" is not actually
important.

But, it's possible to mechanically enforce and nudge documentation writers
to add the delineation marker where the parser is uncertain.

That's right. This is merely a formalization of that hack: I add a
"section" that is intentionally empty and serves only as a marker to the
parser to begin recording a new section.
