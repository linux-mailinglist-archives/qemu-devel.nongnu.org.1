Peter, thought I=E2=80=99d send this little snippet before getting the =
rest of V2 done in case anyone hates this :). I tried to take a similar =
approach to kvm_type,
but I=E2=80=99m not sure if this will be looked upon favorably so want =
an early opinion. The nice thing about kvm_type is at least it has =
differing meaning per
platform so all the impls can do whatever they need, with the below =
it=E2=80=99s really only needed on ARM (and obviously macOS specific) so =
it's a bit odd,
but couldn=E2=80=99t think of how else to be able to be able to get what =
we need out of the memmap during vm creation.=20

How this would be used is almost exactly like how ARMs kvm_type is used. =
We set up hvf_get_physical_address_range to freeze the memory
map and compute the highest gpa, then check if that exceeds our =
platforms largest IPA size and if so return a sane error message. If =
everything
checks out we=E2=80=99d just set the IPA size on the VM config object =
and then create the VM. The current patch should mostly stay the same =
after that bit
of plumbing I think besides removing the macOS 13 ifdef=E2=80=99s (and =
simplifying the copy and pasted loop you pointed out). x86=E2=80=99s
hvf_get_physical_address_range can be NULL.
