I agree that there are potentially maintenance issues. For what is
worth, AFAIR, we only ran into one breaking change in about 3 years
for which we used this approach which was also simple to fix (gpio was
removed from hwcore so we had to pull in gpio.c directly).

No, I think all of the tests in the patch set could be written in qtest.
