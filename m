I agree with all of that. But at the end of the day we need to adhere to the
HW spec as closely as we can, and it's now clear that the assumptions we were
making in this particular check, for the sake of VFIO+irqbypass support, is
sort of spec violation.

I still believe this is something that we would like to discuss in the spec
space, but for now we don't have much to do w.r.t the emulation. If we want
VFIO+irqbypass to work the Linux driver will need to do extra work.

This is what I'll do for v9:

    /*
      * Early check for MSI address match when IOVA == GPA.
      * Note that the (!en_s) condition means that the MSI
      * page table may only be used when guest pages are
      * mapped using the g-stage page table, whether single-
      * or two-stage paging is enabled. It's unavoidable though,
      * because the spec mandates that we do a first-stage
      * translation before we check the MSI page table, which
      * means we can't do an early MSI check unless we have
      * strictly !en_s.
      */
     if (!en_s && (iotlb->perm & IOMMU_WO) &&
         riscv_iommu_msi_check(s, ctx, iotlb->iova)) {
         iotlb->target_as = &s->trap_as;
         iotlb->translated_addr = iotlb->iova;
         iotlb->addr_mask = ~TARGET_PAGE_MASK;
         return 0;
     }


It also came to my attention today that the kernel support is waiting for
the QEMU pieces to land due to the Red Hat PCI ID we're adding. I'll post
v9 later today or next Monday to see if we can speed things up.

Daniel
