I see your point but I think it's important to understand the road ahead of
us.

Knowing that we can build and maintain a usable (does not have to be
perfect) interface to QOM is important, and in fact it's already useful for
the pl011 device's chardev. It's also important to play with more advanced
usage of the language to ascertain what features of the language will be
useful; for example, my current implementation uses generic associated
types which are not available on Debian Bookworm=E2=80=94it should be easy =
to
remove them but if I am wrong that's also a data point, and an important
one.

Don't get me wrong: *for this first device* only, it makes a lot of sense
to have a very C-ish implementation. It lets us sort out the build system
integration, tackle idiomatic bindings one piece at a time, and is easier
to review than Marc-Andr=C3=A9's approach of building the whole QAPI bindin=
gs.
But at the same time, I don't consider a C-ish device better just because
it's written in Rust: as things stand your code has all the disadvantages
of C and all the disadvantages of Rust. What makes it (extremely) valuable
is that your code can lead us along the path towards reaping the advantages
of Rust.

I think we're actually in a great position. We have a PoC from Marc-Andr=C3=
=A9,
plus the experience of glib-rs (see below), that shows us that our goal of
idiomatic bindings is doable; and a complementary PoC from you that will
guide us and let us reach it in little steps. The first 90% of the work is
done, now we only have to do the second 90%... :) but then we can open the
floodgates for Rust code in QEMU.

For what it's worth, in my opinion looking at glib-rs for inspiration is

glib-rs includes support for GObject, which was itself an inspiration for
QOM (with differences, granted).

There are a lot of libraries that we can take inspiration from: in addition
to glib-rs, zbus has an interesting approach to
serialization/deserialization for example that could inform future work on
QAPI. It's not a coincidence that these libraries integrate with more
traditional C code, because we are doing the same. Rust-vmm crates will
also become an interesting topic sooner or later.

There's more to discuss about this topic which I am open to continuing

Absolutely, I will try to post code soonish and also review the build
system integration.

Thanks,

Paolo
