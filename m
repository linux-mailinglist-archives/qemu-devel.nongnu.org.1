Ok, I understand your concerns. What I would like to do is running unmodifi=
ed executables on Qemu so that I can test exactly the same program which wo=
uld run on the real hardware. To properly initialize an SMP system, you hav=
e to do certain things in a proper order. Currently, when I start the Zynq =
machine it immediately executes the ELF entry on both cores. This conflicts=
 with the normal system start sequence which assumes that initially the sec=
ond core waits in an idle loop. For example, the second core is normally re=
leased after the GIC distributor is initialized.

Changing all the existing machines to use this third way is probably a bad =
idea, but would it be possible to make it configurable though the platform =
info or a command line option?
