Correct.

To answer this, we need to consider what doc comments are for:
documenting our external QMP interface for its users.

Types are not part of this QMP interface, only their members can be,
namely as arguments of commands and events, possibly nested into other
arguments.  Types can change in ways that do not affect the interface.
Like in this patch.

Since only members are part of the interface, only members need since
information.

Having to write down since information member by member all the time
would be onerous, so we provide a shorthand: write it down for the type,
and any members without explicit since use that.

This leads us to the answer to your question.  When you refactor types,
take care to preserve the interface documentation's since information,
just like you preserve the actual interface.

Much of the time, this is as trivial as "don't mess with since".

Sometimes, it involves things like adding a new type with an old since.

Occasionally, there's a conflict.  Say you unify two similar types into
one, a perfectly sane refactoring.  But the two types can have
conflicting since information.  Perhaps one type's member @foo goes back
to 4.2, and the other's goes back only to 9.1.  We don't have good
solutions for that.  We do our best in prose.

Maintaining accurate since information is bothersome and error prone.
It should be done by the machine, not us.  John and I have pondered ways
to do this, but we have other projects to finish first.

Questions?
