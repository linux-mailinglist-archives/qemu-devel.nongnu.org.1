Most of this series looks harmless in the sense that we need to write
some workaround code in a single place and can forget about it. So
that's good.

This one affects all of the code we'll write and the replacement is a
bit unwieldy. It might be the most annoying one from the list.

This one will be fairly widespread, too, but only a minor inconvenience.

Requiring structs to be wrapped in with_offsets! has potential to become
quite annoying, too, but it seems we already have a solution for this
with the proc macro.

It would probably make sense to just go ahead and apply the fixes. They
seem a lot more obvious than the question which toolchains we want to
support.
