That's why I said that once this is merged we could deprecate the existing 
machines in favour of ppc500 with the dts for these machines replacing 
them so we can get rid of board codes and can add new machines like p1022 
by adding the needed devices and the dts also under ppce500 which can 
become a generic machine supporting all of these. One could then use -M 
ppce500 -dtb mpc85xx.dtb or p1022.dtb or similar. This would work for all 
dtbs that we have devices for and maybe by adding unimplemented device for 
unknown ones would allow somewhat booting other machines as long as those 
devices are not use. Or if keeping a machine for the -M option for all of 
these is desired then we can think of adding some other kind of alias that 
can set the dtb for the ppce500 and call that. But in any case this would 
reduce the mpc85xx to a trivial wrapper of ppce500 that just sets the dtb 
for the machine.

I also got distracted with other machines so I've postponed this for now 
but want to get back to it eventually.
