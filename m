Yep, there's almost certainly scientific packages that have done
optimizations in their builds. QEMU is slightly more special
though because it is classed as a "critical path" package for
the distro. Even the QEMU linux-user pieces are now critical path,
since they're leveraged by docker & podman for running foreign arch
containers.

I don't know - i'm going to raise this question to find out if
there's any guidance.
