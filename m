Yes, this sounds fair.

Yes, it's a good move that we can have other ways to fix all the problems
without major surgery, and it also looks solid and clean if we have plan to
fix any outlier PCIe devices.

If there will be a repost after all, not sure if Eric would like to add
some of above discussions into either some commit messages or cover letter.
Or some comment in the code might be even better.

Thanks!
