Hi Michael,

Looks like you didn't do another pull request for 10.2. If these can
go upstream fairly early in 11.0 that would be very helpful as we have
quite a few CXL series that I think are (nearly) ready.

I resent the events series but that was mainly because I'd forgotten you'd
replied to this one and so might already have both queued. Sorry about that
if you have them both already.

Jonathan
