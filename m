Yeah the policy makes sense. So it sounds like we're all good for that.

I understand. Well, that's unfortunate that the patch is going back on the
backlog. I'll leave it alone then?

There's always the option if anyone has an old enough system that the EHCI
on it has an actual OHCI companion controller, then they can use actual
hardware to validate the behavior. Barring some message saying the patch
has been approved or that someone wants me to rework the patch, I'll leave
this as abandoned.
