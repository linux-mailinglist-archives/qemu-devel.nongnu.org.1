We support the same "hint" use case in vrend for MTLTexture. So,
without that flag set, there will be no attempt to allocate a
MTLTexture. This works regardless if Venus is used or not. However, in
the Venus use case, the hint does not matter at all because as long as
the new API virgl_renderer_create_handle_for_scanout is used, a
MTLTexture is returned. In this sense, I think it makes sense to
rename *D3D* to *NATIVE*.

I agree with point 2 though, it is better to pass the native device
handle from the Cocoa backend. I will wait for those changes to be
upstreamed.
