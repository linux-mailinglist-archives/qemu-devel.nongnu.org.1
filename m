Thank you, Manos.

I'm not discouraged by the difficulty. I guess I just didn't know where to
start from. Thanks for the direction.

Hello Joseph!<br>
<br>
First, the bad news: QEMU is a sophisticated and complicated project, <br>
and I would not recommend it as the first foray of serious programming <br>
to most people. But the good news is, it is still possible to contribute <b=
r>
without being an expert simply because QEMU is composed of many <br>
different things.<br>
<br>
The usual advice is to take a look at the issues labelled as <br>
&quot;Bite-Sized&quot; on our Issue tracker:<br>
<br>
<a href=3D"https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/?sort=3Dcreated_da=
te&amp;state=3Dopened&amp;label_name%5B%5D=3DBite+Sized&amp;first_page_size=
=3D50" rel=3D"noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://g=
itlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/?sort=3Dcreated_date&amp;state=3Dopene=
d&amp;label_name%5B%5D=3DBite+Sized&amp;first_page_size=3D50</a><br>
<br>
Take your time looking at each of them and you can choose something that <b=
r>
looks approachable to you.<br>
<br>
Note: I see that in many issues people say they want to contribute and <br>
ask for the issue to be assigned to them- no need to do that! Focus on <br>
writing down your solution and sending it to the list while following <br>
the &quot;submitting a patch&quot; docs: <br>
<a href=3D"https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/devel/submitting-a-patch.html" =
rel=3D"noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://www.qemu=
.org/docs/master/devel/submitting-a-patch.html</a><br>
<br>
If you have any kind of technical question you should ask on IRC, if you <b=
r>
happen on any developer being online at the same time as you, or on the <br=
>
list. Do not ask people in private because not only will less people see <b=
r>
your question, but most QEMU maintainers only pay attention to the <br>
mailing list for QEMU related discussion.<br>
<br>
If you have any more questions feel free to ask!<br>
