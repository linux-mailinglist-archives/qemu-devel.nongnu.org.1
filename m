I was referring to that as an example how a DEFINE_MACHINE_WITH_INTERFACES 
should work not suggesting to use OBJECT_DEFINE_TYPE_WITH_INTERFACES.

The difference is that OBJECT_DEFINE_TYPE_WITH_INTERFACES takes a list of 
interfaces and defines the array itself and you pass the array which is 
limiting as you then need to define a lot of arrays to pass to your macro 
instead of only passing the elements and let it define tha array.

I just want to see instead of

static const TypeInfo machine_types[] = {
...lots of boiler plate code here
};

something like

DEFINE_MACHINE_EXTENDED(machine1, TYPE_WHATEVER_MACHINE, {INTERFACE1}, {INTERFACE2}, {})
DEFINE_MACHINE_EXTENDED(machine2, TYPE_OTHER_MACHINE, {INTERFACE1}, {INTERFACE3}, {})
DEFINE_MACHINE_EXTENDED(machine3, TYPE_THIRD_MACHINE, {INTERFACE1}, {})
