CpuModelExpansionInfo.data.deprecated_props is a conditional field, and 
seems to be the only example.

Anyway, in terms of code generated, it's not a very big difference 
between conditioning a complete struct or one of its field.

If all the QAPI devs and maintainers are happy with it, I'm fine with it 
also. That said, CONFIG_KVM will still be an issue as well, because it's 
a target specific define, so please make sure it can be removed safely also.

I can offer to make a prototype adding runtime checks to preserve the 
same schema, list of commands registered, and identical marshaling 
functions. If you decide to just drop all those conditional, it's even 
better, and faster, I'm good with it. My only goal is to compile QAPI 
generated code only once, no more, no less.
