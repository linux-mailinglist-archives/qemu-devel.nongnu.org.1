The commit message seems outdated, there is no such thing as a
FuseRequest object.

I agree with the idea of allocating a separate buffer for the data to be
written. I'm not so sure that the approach taken here with combining an
in-place and a spillover buffer does actually do much for us in exchange
for the additional complexity.

The allocation + memcpy for in_place buf in fuse_co_write() bothers me a
bit. I'd rather have a buffer for the data to write that can be directly
used. And let's be real, we already allocate a 1 MB stack per request. I
don't think 64k more or less make a big difference, but it would allow
us to save the memcpy() for 4k requests and additionally an allocation
for larger requests.

The tradeoff when you use an iov for the buffer in FuseQueue that is
only big enough for the header and fuse_write_in and then directly the
per-request buffer that is owned by the coroutine is that for requests
that are larger than fuse_write_in, you'll have to copy the rest back
from the data buffer first. This seems to be only fuse_setattr_in, which
shouldn't be a hot path at all, and only a few bytes.

All that said, what you have is an obvious improvement over limiting
write requests to 4k.
