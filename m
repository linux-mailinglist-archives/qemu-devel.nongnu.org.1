Not sure how it works here. If we allow QMP to release such extents and
clear the pending list entrees accordingly, later if the host response with
empty extent list, how can the device figure out which request the response is
for. The spec assumes the response comes in order, so the head of the
pending list should be removed from the pending list, however, if QMP
process already removed it.

The key problem here is for empty updated extent list, we do not have a way to
figure out the corresponding request as there is no DPA info to look
into.

The assumption here is FM first initiates the request to add some
extents to the hosts, and later FM initiates to release the extents
while the extents has not been accepted by the host yet.
