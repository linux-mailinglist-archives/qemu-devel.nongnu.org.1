Thanks for the clarification. I think I understand the sentiment.
Propagating the error codes when possible, is much preferred. But
letting the calls go unchecked is problematic too, so I don't know if we
can get around assert_hvf_ok in some shape or form.

You're right, that it might encourage use as an easy fix. I'll keep an
eye on it in my reviews.
