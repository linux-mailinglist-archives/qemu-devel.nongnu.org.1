Yeah, that's an unacceptable penalty on the incoming side for sure.

How about we simply change the outbound migration channel to be in
non-blocking mode ?   I originally put it in blocking mode way back
in 9e4d2b98ee98f4cee50d671e500eceeefa751ee0, but if I look at the
QEMUFile impl of qemu_fill_buffer and qemu_fflush, but should be
coping with a non-blocking socket. qemu_fill_buffer has explicit
code to wait, and qemu_fflush uses the _all() variant whcih has
built-in support for waiting. So I'm not seeing an obvious need
to run the channel in blocking mode.

Using non-blocking will prevent the return path thuread setting
in a read() call, so we won't have mutual exclusion between read
and write which this patch was trying to avoid

ie, this delta on top of this patch:
