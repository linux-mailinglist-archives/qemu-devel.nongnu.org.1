Currently, the postcopy blocktime feature maintains vCPU fault information
using an array (vcpu_addr[]).  It has two issues.

Issue 1: Performance Concern
============================

The old algorithm was almost OK and fast on inserts, except that the lookup
is slow and won't scale if there are a lot of vCPUs: when a page is copied
during postcopy, mark_postcopy_blocktime_end() will walk the whole array
trying to find which vCPUs are blocked by the address.  So it needs
constant O(N) walk for each page resolution.

Alexey (the author of postcopy blocktime) mentioned the perf issue and how
to optimize it in a piece of comment in the page resolution path.  The
comment was (interestingly..) not complete, but it's relatively clear what
he wanted to say about this perf issue.

Issue 2: Wrong Accounting on re-entrancies
==========================================

People might think that each vCPU should only and always get one fault at a
time, so that when the blocktime layer captured one fault on one vCPU, we
should never see another fault message on this vCPU.

It's almost correct, except in some extreme rare cases.

Case 1: it's possible the fault thread processes the userfaultfd messages
too fast so it can see >1 messages on one vCPU before the previous one was
resolved.

Case 2: it's theoretically also possible one vCPU can get even more than
one message on the same fault address if a fault is retried by the
kernel (e.g., handle_userfault() got interrupted before page resolution).

As this info might be important, instead of using commit message, I put
more details into the code as comment, when introducing an array
maintaining concurrent faults on one vCPU.  Please refer to the comments
for details on both cases, especially case 1 which can be tricky.

Case 1 sounds rare, but it can be easily reproduced locally for me when we
run blocktime together with the migration-test on the vanilla postcopy.

New Design
==========

This patch should do almost what Alexey mentioned, but slightly
differently: instead of having an array to maintain vCPU fault addresses,
for each of the fault message we push a message into a hash, indexed by the
fault address.

With the hash, it can replace the old two structs: both the vcpu_addr[]
array, and also the array to store the start time of the fault.  However
due to above we need one more counter array to account concurrent faults on
the same vCPU - that should even be needed in the old code, it's just that
the old code was buggy and it will blindly overwrite an existing
entry.. now we'll start to really track everything.

The hash structure might be more efficient than tree to maintain such
addr->(cpu, fault_time) information, so that the insert() and lookup()
paths should ideally both be ~O(1).  After all, we do not need to sort.

Here we need to do one remove() though after the lookup().  It could be
slow but only if many vCPUs faulted exactly on the same address (so when
the list of cpu entries is long), which should be unlikely. Even with that,
it's still a worst case O(N) (consider 400 vCPUs faulted on the same
address and how likely is it..) rather than a constant O(N) complexity.

When at it, touch up the tracepoints to make them slightly more useful.
One tracepoint is added when walking all the fault entries.
