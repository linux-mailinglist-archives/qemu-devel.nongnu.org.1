What is usb-ohci?  Do you mean ohci-hcd?

Please be more specific: _Which_ interrupts aren't being handled?  That 
is, which flags remain set in the intrstatus register when the handler 
returns?

Isn't that behavior mistaken?  A level-triggered IRQ that remains set when 
it is re-enabled (when the various shared handlers return) should cause 
another interrupt to occur right away.

Edged-triggered interrupts would be a different story, of course.

To answer these questions we need more information.
