Well, I guess... but why propose such a complex solution when you can simply specify 
the endianness of the PCM frame? If you think back to pre-1.0 virtio where everything 
was done using target vCPU endianness, why did they not implement this solution back 
then to solve the problem instead of mandating that virtio-1.0 onwards should simply 
use little-endian? Clearly specifying that all implementations should use 
little-endian was the deemed to be the best way to solve all these issues.

Have you raised this issue on the virtio-dev mailing list? It's worth explaining the 
problem you're trying to solve there, since hopefully the person or persons who 
designed and proposed the virtio-snd specification will be able to give you the 
correct advice.


ATB,

Mark.
