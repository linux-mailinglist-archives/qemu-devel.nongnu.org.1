Currently, the best case happens if both sides are I/O bound with respect
to the VFIO devices - reading device state from the source device as
fast as it can produce it and loading device state into the target device
as fast as it can consume it.

These devices aren't normally seriously network bandwidth constrained
here.

Yes, we don't want the case that loading device state into one VFIO device
blocks loading such state into another VFIO device and so the second VFIO
device ends up being partially idle during that time.

The current design uses exactly one loading thread per VFIO device.
