Not a fair benchmark though.

People use cancel alot because 'precopy' cannot complete in a
predictable amount of time, any time guesstime can suddenly
get much worse if the guest dirties memory differently. So
people give up and cancel it after waiting ridiculously long
and never being sure if it is nearing the finish.

Once a migrate has been switched to 'postcopy' phase, however,
we have what should be a highly predictable completion time,
directly related to the amount of untransferred pages. That
time should not get worse. The amount of time spent in the
'postcopy' phase will depend on how long you let the migrate
run in 'precopy' before flipping to 'postcopy'

IOW, I think there's a reasonable case to be made that NOT
having the ability to cancel while in 'postcopy' phase would
be mostly acceptable. You give up the ability to cancel for
a while, in exchange for a clearly determined completion
time.

Yep, I think users/apps expect "cancel" to be safe. So if it can't be
safe at certain times, we should reject it in those time windows.

yank is for the case where the network connections are completely stuck,
causing QEMU to potentially get stalled in I/O operations until a TCP
timeout is reached. yank force unwedges any stuck I/O by aggresively
closing the connections. It is most useful in the non-migration use
cases though.

I would say the difference is like a graceful shutdown vs pulling the
power plug in a bare metal machine

'cancel' is intended to be graceful. It should leave you with a functional
QEMU (or refuse to run if unsafe).

'yank' is intended to be forceful, letting you get out of bad situations
that would otherwise require you to kill the entire QEMU process, but
still with possible associated risk data loss to the QEMU backends.

They have overlap, but are none the less different.

With regards,
Daniel
