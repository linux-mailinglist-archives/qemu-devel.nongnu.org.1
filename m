If x-sdtrig is 'false' and 'debug' is on, and then we warn if debug=true and x-sdtrig
is false, we'll warn every time using the defaults.

Given what you said here:

I believe we can deprecate 'debug' and simply ignore its existence. Do everything else with
x-sdtrig. So if an user sets any 'debug' value we'll:

- warn that the flag is deprecated
- set x-sdtrig to whatever value the user set to 'debug'

'debug' will become just an alternate way to set x-sdtrig. The logic should just check for
x-sdtrig.
