qemu_open_internall will already do a nice error message. If it gets
EINVAL when using O_DIRECT, it'll retry without O_DIRECT and if that
works, it'll reoprt "filesystem does not support O_DIRECT"

Having said that I see a problem with /dev/fdset handling, because
we're only validating O_ACCMODE and that excludes O_DIRECT.

If the mgmt apps passes an FD with O_DIRECT already set, then it
won't work for VMstate saving which is unaligned.

If the mgmt app passes an FD without O_DIRECT set, then we are
not setting O_DIRECT for the multifd RAM threads.

With regards,
Daniel
