Don't understand what you're talking about here. I may remind that this
is not my QEMU doc patch to begin with, hence it has nothing to do with
Mesa nor with virglrenderer. Alex wants to help QEMU users by adding
more QEMU documentation.

Maybe you're also not very familiar with the Mesa development process.
This is okay, no problems.

Thanks a lot! More reviewers always good to have, will definitely ping
you. Right now writing more Mesa documentation isn't a priority, hence
will take time to get to it.
