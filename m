The NVIC is in some sense part of the CPU, but I think I'd rather
not move it. (You'll also find that setting CONFIG_ARM_V7M pulls
in code in hw/misc (RAS handling) and hw/timer (systick timer), so
it's not just hw/intc code that's affected here.)

I guess this is kind of happening because we have one symbol
CONFIG_ARM_V7M and we're using it both for "we want the v7M
system components like the NVIC and timer" and for "we want
the v7M core CPU support". So maybe another approach here would
be to have CONFIG_ARM_V7M and CONFIG_ARM_V7M_CPU or something,
where linux-user selects just the latter. But unless you think
that approach would work out more cleanly, I'm OK with how this
patch does things.

(Sorry for not getting back to this series for so long.)

thanks
