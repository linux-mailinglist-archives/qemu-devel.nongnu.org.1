I can give that a try.  If I'm understanding the request correctly, I
would map it as follows:

BDRV_BSTAT_PRECISE => WANT_ZERO | WANT_OFFSET_VALID | WANT_ALLOCATED
BDRV_BSTAT_ALLOCATED => WANT_ALLOCATED
BDRV_BSTAT_ZERO => WANT_ZERO

while still trying to keep it a mechanical conversion in this patch.
