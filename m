Yes.  I think there're other ways to implicitly taking mr refcounts though
(e.g. directly used as root address space when address_space_init()).  From
that POV maybe the 1st requirement isn't as special.

Ah, this is definitely obscure.. at least it should have some comments
explaining why the ASes are there.

Now reading a bit into the problem, I'm not even sure if this is the right
thing to do, starting from ffa8a3e3b2 where it starts to introduce
memory_region_find() for virtio_address_space_lookup().

I don't know the piece of code well enough to say, but IMHO logically it
shouldn't need to depend on global address space information for the
lookup.

I think this patch should still be the last resort, let's still try to
discuss if there's other options.

For example, afaiu RCU readers at least do not rely on view->root to be
present, can we already release the refcount for the view->root within the
BQL section?  I mean something like this:

That at least do not introduce weak-refcount concepts.

True.

IMHO we can see feasibility of above "early unref view->root" idea, then
this one, before the original solution.
