If something waits for a BlockJob to finish using aio_poll() from
qemu_aio_context then a deadlock is possible since the iohandler_ctx
won't get a chance to execute. The only suspicious code path I found was
job_completed_txn_abort_locked() -> job_finish_sync_locked() but I'm not
sure whether it triggers this scenario. Please check that code path.

In the long term it would be cleaner to move away from synchronous APIs
that rely on nested event loops. They have been a source of bugs for
years.

If vm_stop() and perhaps other operations in save_snapshot() were
asynchronous, then it would be safe to run the operation in
qemu_aio_context without using iohandler_ctx. vm_stop() wouldn't invoke
its callback until vCPUs were quiesced and outside device emulation
code.

I think this patch is fine as a one-line bug fix, but we should be
careful about falling back on this trick because it makes the codebase
harder to understand and more fragile.
