Excellent work, and thanks for posting this RFC!

IMHO, having patches 2 and 5 splitted is a bit confusing, and exposing 
(temporarily) the generated.rs file in patches is not a good move.
Any reason you kept it this way?

Maybe it could be better if build.rs file was *not* needed for new 
devices/folders, and could be abstracted as a detail of the python 
wrapper script instead of something that should be committed.

Having a simple rust/pl011/meson.build is nice and good taste!

As a complement to this, and for other readers, in more than having a 
lock file (fixing version you use), cargo crates system is designed to 
be immutable (see: https://crates.io/policies), and it means there is a 
strong guarantee that a published package will stay there, to the 
opposite of npm, pypi, or most of other similar systems.

"Crate deletion by their owners is not possible to keep the registry as 
immutable as possible."

I believe this is a *key* feature of Rust ecosystem and should be 
emphasized regarding the policy for Rust dependencies to come.

I would not be in favor to vendor all dependencies. Beyond the "offline 
build" scenario, it has only downsides.

Sure, we should really debate before introducing a new dependency, but 
the technical difficulty to mirror its sources and dependencies should 
not be an argument for or against it.

What will happen the day we want to introduce something bigger than a 
simple dependency? (let's say "serde" for instance)

Besides the size aspect, which potential advantage would there be to 
switch to no_std?
We don't build a bare metal or kernel binary here, so why introduce this 
restriction willingly?
