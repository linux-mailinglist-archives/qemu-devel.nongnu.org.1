We don't even need reference-counting memory regions if we are sure 
there would be no reference to a MR when the device owning it is gone 
because a MR is already alive when the device owning it is.

Unfortunately that is not the case. If you grep for memory_region_ref(), 
you will find lot of places that asynchronously calls 
memory_region_unref(). Devices can be removed whenever the BQL is 
unlocked so we certainly need to count references.

I think it is better to remove the reference counter from Object and 
create a subclass like RefCounted to add one for sub-struct-field cases. 
There are exceptional cases in virtio-gpu-gl that dynamically allocate 
MRs but such a device can create Objects that functions as owners of 
dynamically-allocated MRs.

Such a change is independent and out of the scope of this change though. 
It also requires to convert all other usage of Object to RefCounted, 
which is not really trivial.
