In theory the test is using rva22 cpus on purpose to try to minimize this
kind of thing. Back then we were worried that the changes in rv64 CPU would
trigger too much test changes. In practice every time we add some new
riscv,isa DT entry, due to an innate QEMU feature that we're now advertising
and whatnot, this test will break.

One thing that crossed my mind but I didn't get to implement it is to provide
a static riscv,isa based on accelerator, e.g. if we're running '-accel qtest'
then we would always return the same riscv,isa regardless of the changes
made in the common emulation. I'm not sure the implications of doing that but
it's something that I think it's worth exploring. Otherwise we'll have to
keep updating this ACPI bios table test from time to time.
