I don't think we can prevent out-of-tree extensions. We do however say
the plugin API is not considered a stable interface - we want to be able
to evolve the interface without worrying about supporting code we can't
see.

There is basic versioning support in the plugin interface to catch
mismatches but there is certainly no backward compatibility - unlike for
example QEMU's approach to machine model versioning.

There is a long history of academic forks of QEMU which have been done
to support various papers. Usually these changes never get upstreamed
and as you say get left to bitrot on old branches. This is unfortunate
because potential improvements to upstream QEMU never get made.

I should point out there are some cases of academic work being
upstreamed - the MTTCG changes led to a number of papers being published
and I like to think the overall quality of the academic work was
improved by having early review of the patches on the list as it was
being developed.

Absolutely - the aim of the plugin interface was to remove the need for
custom hooks which inevitably bitrot when the instruction frontends get
re-factored. The unicorn engine fork for example will never be as up to
date for emulating AArch64 as the upstream because it is an actively
maintained architecture forever adding new CPU features.

I'm not sure. As I understand it the communities general worry is
splitting development unnecessarily and leaving QEMU as an "open core"
to which proprietary extensions became the only way to emulate certain
hardware or syscalls.

The security use-case certainly seems like a new novel use case that I'm
personally minded to support. It doesn't sound like much else is needed
other than the ability to reset the PC while executing.
