Secure boot offers signing and hashing.  You can add both signing
certificates and authenticode hashes to 'db'.

Sure.  You'll go need some container, say a cpio archive, but that is
something vmfwupdate loader and loaded firmware have to agree on and not
something we have to worry about too much for the vmfwupdate interface
design.

You easily get that by looking at the vTPM measurements.  So not sure
what you are asking for, do you want be able to also do that without a
vTPM?

Makes sense to me.

> Or even a full variable store blob.

Hmm, not sure.  I'd rather go for passing efi signature database
appendix, probably for both allow ('db') and deny ('dbx').  That is
going to work better I think, variable store format is an
firmware-internal implementation detail I'd avoid encoding that in
some interface.

Hmm, right.  Physical location matters for the launch measurement, so
adding opaque_measured_addr to struct vmfwupdate isn't going to work
very well.

> Ukify.py then generates the blob along with the FUKI.

Doesn't fly from a distro point of view.  The UKI is signed, so RH ships
that and the customer can't modify it to update the blob, say with some
additional hashes for 'db'.

Effectively we need something roughly equivalent to shim's MokList.  The
distro ships a default configuration (like the cert compiled into the
shim binary) which works fine for most people.  For IGVM that would be a
default efi variable store compiled into the firmware binary.

If you need additional stuff (like the signer cert for the nvidia
driver) there must be some way to add hashes and certificates to db/dbx.

Does it make sense to simply move the firmware update sections from the
main UKI to an add-on?  That would allow customers to easily use their
own if they wish, without breaking the RH signature on the UKI.

Guess we'll have to update the IGVM format spec for that, so we have
page types for 'db' and 'dbx'.  With that it should be possible to load
the igvm, find + update the pages + write it out again.  Then wrap it
into an UKI add-on + copy to ESP.

RH default igvm/add-on would simply have empty 'db' and 'dbx' pages.

Looks workable to me.

i.e. have a IGVM parameter for opaque_addr + opaque_size instead of
placing this in the vmfwupdate struct?

take care,
  Gerd

PS: in Berlin tomorrow?
