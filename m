Uhm, if the device node was always the same, regardless of "machine"
then there'd be no need for any properties other than
compatible/reg/links to provider nodes! But unfortunately that's not what
properties are limited to, there's properties for a whole host of other
elements of device configuration.

Generally speaking, properties will be fixed for a given "machine"/board,
but some could change depending on things like AMP affecting which
mailbox channel you're permitted to use or using a different firmware
(or version of said firmware) can change a node. For example, the
extensions supported by a CPU can change based on what version of OpenSBI
you're running. The latter might not affect QEMU, because you're providing
a DT for the firmware to edit, but from the OS point of view there's
different, but valid and complete, descriptions for the same physical
hardware.

Also, on the same machine you might have variation between two instances
of the same IP, other than just the reg/provider links changing, for
example if there's two different dwmac ethernet controllers configured
to provide different maximum speeds.

So yeah, I can't give you any assurance that even one specific IP/CPU on
a specific SoC on a specific machine/board will have the same device
node unfortunately.

Yeah, FPGA stuff is an extreme case, but a great thing to use as a test
for the idea, since you could have properties that change from
compilation to compilation. Take a look at something like snps,dwmac.yaml
where there's about seven thousand different properties, many of which
could be varied if it were in an FPGA design rather than an ASIC..

The other kinda extreme case in variability is the stuff that's on a
board rather than an SoC, for example the same mmc/sd card controller
on an SoC can have different device nodes depending on how a board has
been designed. What Linux calls "IIO" devices are also impacted
massively by how a board is configured or use-case, since they're often
measurement devices with different analogue circuitry connected to them.

I'm not 100% sure how all that translates to a machine in QEMU, dunno if
running a different AMP context would require a different machine etc,
but I hope that gives a general impression of what could potentially
vary? LMK if not.
