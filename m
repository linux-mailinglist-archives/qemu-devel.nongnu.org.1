First, I'd like to thank you for your detailed reply.

It depends. Some properties have true by default. The others have false.

I converted on to auto and off to false in a following patch.

Not just about conversion, but this inconsistency require users to know 
whether a property is bool or OnOffAuto and change how the values are 
written in JSON accordingly. This somewhat hurts usability.

It's a new insight I didn't know. Properties in qdev have a default 
value instead of special "absent". But if QAPI does have special 
"absent", perhaps qdev may be modified to align with.

We have "false by default" properties so it unfortunately does not work.

I may have missed something, but I think that will break JSON string 
literals "on" and "off".
