I more or less agree with Dan - that is how it is currently arranged.

In the past, however, I have suggested moving certain other modules
that are bigger than a single file into python/ for the sake of being
able to maintain them more aggressively: i.e. I do not regularly check
for Python regression and compatibility issues for things under
scripts/, except for qapi, which is also something I proposed moving
to python/ before.

The current state of things is that I aggressively check and test these thi=
ngs:

- python/*
- scripts/qapi/
- docs/sphinx/qapi_domain.py
- docs/sphinx/qapidoc.py

Everything else is just "best effort" which generally means "I fix it
when I notice that it is broken". If it is not a multi-file module and
not necessary for configure+build to run, I think for now it is best
kept outside of python/.
