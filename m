Right.

I think we know how it works before this patch.  And with that, I suppose
Akihiko managed to figure out how it was not freed properly now for those
due to the circular reference issue that this series is tracking.  That's
definitely one step forward to me.

Said that, this is also the major controversial point so far on this patch
on how we should implement such object-internal auto-detach mechanism for
MRs even within the same object.

My suggestion is sticking with the current simple model as much as possible
on always using owner refcounts for MRs, while resolving the issue we're
facing with that.  I have a complete patch (which, I would say, should
still be under authorship of Akihiko; what I provided is a fixup on top of
his, and I slightly touched up some comments to provide the best
readability):

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/Z4e7gFSqdhcmJPYb@x1n

So it's more of a preference that I prefer his older patch with the fixup,
rather than this patch.

Akihiko would prefer start using two refcounts, one almost dedicated for
object internal MR refcounts so that we'll finalize internal MRs in order
(which I questioned on the necessary), but not completely.

Is this question about one MR being struct field of one object, or
specific to something else?

Yes, I think I understand slightly better on the issue we're facing now,
thanks.
