RAPL is used to measure CPU/DRAM/maybe GPU domains.
see my other reply to Daniel RAPL + aux
 (https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg1072593.html)
My point wrt RAPL is: CPU domain on host and inside guest
should be doing the same thing, i.e. report only package/core
consumption of virtual CPU and nothing else (non vCPU induced load
should not be included in CPU domain).

For non vCPU consumption, we should do the same as bare-metal,
i.e. add power sensors where necessary. As minimum we can add
a system power meter sensor, which could account for total
energy draw (and that can include not only QEMU aux threads,
but also for other related processes (aka process handling dpdk NIC,
or other vhost user backend)).
Individual per device sensors also a possibility in the future
(i.e per NIC) is we can find a suitable sensor on host to derive
guest value.

no disagreement here.

Given the topic is relatively new, the tooling mostly concentrates on
RAPL as most available sensor. But some tools can pull energy values
from other sources, we surely can teach them to pull values from
a sensor(s) we'd want to add to QEMU (i.e. for an easy start borrow
sensor handling from lm_sensors). I'd pick acpi power meter as
a possible candidate for it is being guest OS agnostic and
we can attach it to anything in machine tree.

=46rom QEMU point of view, it would be fine to get values from external
process and just proxy them to guest (preferably without any massaging).

Also on QEMU side, I'd suggest to split current monolith functionality
in 2 parts: frontend (KVM MSR interface for starters) and backend object
(created with -object CLI option) that will handle communication
with an external daemon. That way QEMU would be able easily change/add
different frontend and backend options (ex: add frontend for RAPL
with TCG accel, add backend for Kelper or other project(s)
down the road). (it would be good to make this split even for
qemu-vmsr-helper). (if you are interested, I can guide you wrt
QEMU side of the question).

PS:
As for other projects we probably should ask if they are open to an idea.
They definitely would need some patches for per thread accounting,
and maybe for some API to talk with external users (but the later
might exist and it might be better for QEMU to adopt it (here QEMU
backend object might help as translator of existing protocol to
QEMU specific internals).
The point is QEMU won't have to reinvent wheel, and other projects
will get more exposure/user-base.

On top of the projects, you've already pointed out for possible
integration with. I could add pmdadenki (CCed few authors) which
some distros are shipping/using.
