So in the current design framework, the way you would model
that kind of daughtercard is that you define a bus type
corresponding to the daughtercard slot. For instance, for the
Arduino Shield daughtercard spec supported by the mps3 boards,
you would define the machine models to implement that
bus (which wraps up i2c, gpio etc), and define some models
of Shield daughtercards. Then users can use "-device tmp105-shield"
on the command line and they don't need to know the internal
details of which IRQ lines on the board are supposed to be used
by the daughterboard, etc. This matches the real world hardware
where the user plugs in a daughterboard rather than soldering
wires directly between components.

Directly exposing to users a "plug GPIO lines together" interface
has some awkward sharp edges:
 * it is effectively making the QOM paths into user-facing APIs,
   which restricts our ability to refactor the implementation
   of the board without breaking existing user command lines.
   (In particular, anything using /machine/peripheral-anon/ is
   extremely vulnerable to changes in the board code.)
 * the user needs to know exactly how the board is wired up,
   including details like what GPIO inputs are free and which
   are used, and how each device orders its GPIO input lines.
 * at the moment there is no guard against trying to plug two
   GPIOs into a single output -- it just won't do the right thing.
   Currently we can say "that's a bug in QEMU C code if we do that",
   but a user-facing interface ought to be more robust.
 * how does this interact with hotpluggable devices? If you
   gpio-connect to a hotpluggable device and then hot-unplug
   it do we refuse the unplug, auto-disconnect the gpios, or
   just crash?

As I say, the "I want to be able to plug devices together on
the command line" usecase is real -- but I think that satisfying
it is something we should do with a coherent approach to the
whole problem, not piecemeal.
