VFIO can definitely do that, but I am not sure how that would help.. as I
think the migration object can never go away anyway during setup->cleanup,
so taking that extra refcount shouldn't change anything.

IOW, AFAICT this bug is triggered only when without migration at all.

Right, Dave also mentioned something in 892ae715b6bc about moving it
earlier:

    We do this a bit earlier; so hopefully migration gets out of the way
    before all the devices etc are freed.

But I don't know the relationship on device free() v.s. the migration
object.  We might at least want to figure that out if we want to move it
again.

I notice that vdpa also started using migration_is_setup_or_active(), so if
it's used in more places, maybe indeed we can consider making them safe to
be called at any phase of QEMU.

Logically it is safe in vm state change hook always because it has the BQL
and the object can only be freed when with BQL.

So let me send a small patch later to hopefully make all these exported
functions (including migration_file_set_error() in this case, logically
anything in migration/misc.h) safe to be called without migration.
