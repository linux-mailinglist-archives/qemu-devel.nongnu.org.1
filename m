Is what you're worried about that there is still a reference left in
the opaque pointer of an fd handler, but it's not in the refcount and
therefore this already frees the listener while thread 2 will still
access it?

I think the way you would normally do this is schedule a BH in thread 2
to do the critical work. If you delete the fd handler and unref the
listener in thread 2, then there is no race.

But maybe adding a callback for node deletion in AioHandler wouldn't
hurt because the opaque pointer pretty much always references something
and doing an unref when deleting the AioHandler should be a pretty
common pattern.

Aren't both QMP and incoming NBD connections always handled in the main
thread? I'm not sure if I know a case where we would actually get this
pattern with two different threads today. Of course, that doesn't mean
that we couldn't get it in the future.
