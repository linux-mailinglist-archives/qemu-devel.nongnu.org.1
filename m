Both @path and @qom-path are used (sadly).  @path is used for all kinds
of paths, whereas @qom-path is only used for QOM paths.  That's why I
prefer it.

However, you're making a compelling local consistency argument: cxl.json
uses only @path.  Sticking to that makes sense.

How are these IDs assigned?

Include a reference to the spec here?

Is the numeric encoding of flags appropriate?

In general, we prefer symbolic encodings.  Numeric encodings can make
sense when

=E2=80=A2 the encoding is stable, and

=E2=80=A2 QEMU doesn't need to decode it, only pass it on to something else=
, and

=E2=80=A2 both the QMP client and the "something else" prefer a numeric
  encoding.

The protocol sketch is for me, not necessarily the doc comment.  I'd
like to understand at high level how this stuff works, because only then
can I meaningfully review the docs.

Thanks!
