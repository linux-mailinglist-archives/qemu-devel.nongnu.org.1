Happily in our case all shared members has explicit "since" equal in both copies pre-patch. So it doesn't really matter which "Since:" we use for the whole shared structure (I propose 10.0, to stress when it actually introduced).

"addr" field doesn't have explicit "since", so we'd better keep 1.3 for command and 4.2 for structure. I can denote it in "Since: " of corresponding small structures.
