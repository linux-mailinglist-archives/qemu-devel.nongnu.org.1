Mmm, this would certainly be nice, but at least so far we haven't
needed to make extensive changes, luckily (you can see how small
our local adjustments are here).

Thanks for the heads-up on that one. A further sync should
be straightforward after this one, I expect.

Also as much as anything else it's just nice for us not to
diverge if we can avoid it.

Incidentally, I'm curious if the kernel docs see problems
with docutils 0.22 -- we had a report about problems there,
at least some of which seem to be because the way kerneldoc.py
adds its rST output is triggering the new docutils to complain
if the added code doesn't have a consistent title style
hierarchy: https://sourceforge.net/p/docutils/bugs/508/
(It looks like they're trying to address this on the docutils side;
we might or might not adjust on our side too by fixing up the
title styles if that's not too awkward for us.)

QEMU already requires Python 3.9 or better; our configure checks:

check_py_version() {
    # We require python >= 3.9.
    # NB: a True python conditional creates a non-zero return code (Failure)
    "$1" -c 'import sys; sys.exit(sys.version_info < (3,9))'
}

Thanks for the confirmation that the kernel is being more
conservative on python requirements than we are; I did
wonder about this but merely assumed you probably were
rather than specifically checking :-)

is the extra colon intentional, or do you agree that it's
a bug? You can see it in the kernel docs output at e.g.
https://docs.kernel.org/core-api/workqueue.html#c.workqueue_attrs

where in the documentation of struct workqueue_attrs,
"Definition:" gets a kernel but the corresponding "Members"
and "Description" don't.  (Also "Description" is out-dented
there when it probably should not be, but that's separate.)

thanks
