Yeah, the new Coverity check that has resulted in it detecting
hundreds of new "issues" relating to overflow is a bit broken
and has produced a lot of "it ought to be able to realise that
what it's suggesting is impossible" issues.

For instance there is a whole category of issues which look like:

     int x =3D foo(); /* returns -1 on error */
     if (x < 0) {
         return;
     }
     some arithmetic operation involving x;

where it complains that the arithmetic operation might overflow
because x might be negative because foo() can return a negative
value. It seems like it traces a line from "x could be a
specific constant value here" through to "this is a place where
if we use that constant value then it would go wrong", without
tying it into its own dataflow knowledge that would tell it that
the code-execution-path it claims is problematic can't happen
with that value of the constant.

I resolved at least a hundred of these new errors as false-positives;
this is one of the cases where I felt that even though it wasn't
actually correct about the possible error it was somewhere where
we could make our code more readable to humans (it took me two
tries reading the code before I figured out what was going on
and that this wasn't a "confusion between whether variable is
a bit value or a mask" bug).

(Also it's possible Coverity will also complain about the
possible-use-uninitialized; we can't tell until the change is
in the tree and it gets re-scanned. But if it does I'll mark
that as a false-positive.)

thanks
