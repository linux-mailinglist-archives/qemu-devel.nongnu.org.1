Hi; thanks for doing this backport. I checked that the output
with this patch applied is still the same as with the old
kernel-doc, and eyeballed the diffs between our kernel-doc
and the Linux version, to confirm that we have kept our two
minor QEMU-specific modifications and haven't missed anything
from Linux's version that we ought to have. So:

Reviewed-by: Peter Maydell <peter.maydell@linaro.org>

On your two questions:

(1) As Dan says, QEMU already enforces a new enough
Python version, so we don't need to handle 3.6. I think
the main thing driving a choice to backport or not those
changes would be simply keeping in sync with Linux's
version of the script so we don't diverge. We want to
make future re-syncing of the script as easy as possible.

(2) Regarding the location of the kernel-doc libraries:
we seem to have two things here, possibly in tension:
 - we don't want to gratuitously diverge from Linux
 - QEMU's directory hierarchy is not the kernel's

In particular, I'm not sure tools/ is where we would
naturally put python libraries used during the build
process. Maybe that would be python/ for us, but I defer
to John or another Python expert on that.

Hopefully this would not be a major divergence because it
would just be "our python path happens to be different
from the one the kernel uses, but the actual python code
just imports the modules by name and doesn't need to know
their specific path" ?

Personally I am OK with our taking this patch as-is
and dealing with the above questions (or not) as a
followon thing, if nobody has any objections to that
approach.

thanks
