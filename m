* From the comment and condition above, both 'tls' and 'file' channels
are not peekable, ie. no magic value to peek. The
'migration-file-incoming' check also helps to cover the
migrate_mapped_ram() case IIUC.

* First we tried to call 'multifd_send_shutdown()' to close multifd
channels before calling postcopy_start(). That's the best case
scenario wherein multifd channels are closed before postcopy starts.
So that there's no confusion and/or jumbling of different data
packets. It did not work, as qemu would crash during
multifd_shutdown().

* Second is we push/flush all multifd pages before calling
postcopy_start() and let the multifd channels exist/stay till the
migration ends, after that they are duly shutdown. It is working well
so far, passing all migration tests too.

* Third, if we want to confirm that multifd pages are received on the
destination before calling postcopy_start(), then the best way is for
the destination to send an acknowledgement to the source side that it
has received and processed all multifd pages and nothing is pending on
the multifd channels.

* Another could be to define a multifd_recv_flush() function, which
could process and clear the receive side multifd queue, so that no
multifd pages are pending there. Not sure how best to do this yet.
Also considering it lacks proper communication and synchronisation
between source and destination sides, it does not seem like the best
solution.

* Do you have any other option/approach in mind?

* TBH, this sounds like a remote corner case.

* I'm testing the revised patch series and will send it shortly.

Thank you.
