  Hi,

> As a heads up, I believe we have a similar problem with a few of the CXL IDs.
> The root port and type 3 device both use Intel IDs that were not reserved

Essentially we have two kinds of PCI devices in qemu.

 * The ones which try to mimic existing hardware, they usually have the
   PCI ID of the device they are emulating (and use the qemu subsystem ID).
   The classic example is the cirrus vga.  There are also many intel
   chipset devices for piix4 ('pc' machine type) and ich9 ('q35' machine
   type) with intel IDs.

 * The ones which are PCI class implementations and do not need a
   specific ID for drivers to accept them.  Most of them have a
   PCI device ID from the 1b36 vendor ID range.

The former tend to be older devices (before hardware standardization was
a thing, also before we got a range from 1b36 for qemu), and the latter
tend to be newer devices.  There are also a bunch of exceptions for
historical reasons.  The ahci emulation has a ich9 id.  xhci even has
two variants (one mimicking a NEC host adapter, one with qemu device id).

So, in short, using the intel IDs is not necessarily a problem.  Depends
a bit on what kind of device we are talking about.  For PCI class
devices it usually is more useful to have a qemu ID though.

That is perfectly fine.  There is no need to change IDs, although it
makes sense to document that fact in docs/specs/pci-ids.rst

Moving them to qemu pci id range is an option too if you prefer that.
Your choice.

take care,
  Gerd
