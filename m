Hmmm... Don't we violate "late-block-activate" contract by this?

Me go and check:

# @late-block-activate: If enabled, the destination will not activate
#     block devices (and thus take locks) immediately at the end of
#     migration.  (since 3.0)

Yes, we'll violate it by this patch. So, for now the only exception is when autostart is enabled, but libvirt correctly use late-block-activate + !autostart.

Interesting, when block layer is assumed to be activated.. Aha, only in qmp_cont().


So, what to do with this all:

Either libvirt should not use late-block-activate for migration of stopped vm. This way target would be automatically activated

Or if libvirt still need postponed activation (I assume, for correctly switching shared disks, etc), Libvirt should do some additional QMP call. It can't be "cont", if we don't want to run the VM. So, probably, we need additional "block-activate" QMP command for this.

And, anyway, trying to migrate inactive block layer should fail with some good error message rather than crash.
