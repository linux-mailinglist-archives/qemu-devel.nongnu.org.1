Yes, that's really the current goal, and why I added that assert(), so it
fails any attempts trying to create one more instance of it, because
normally it's by accident.  The theory issue to solve is when some class is
not ready for being created more than once, so it must not happen.

My plan was to properly guard qdev creation with this which can fail
pretty, so it's a "programming error" otherwise.

Yeah I agree it's not pretty, IMHO it's a trade-off comparing to glib's,
I'll comment below for that.

Meanwhile I hope there should be very limited places in QEMU to randomly
create "any" object on the fly.. so far only qom/device-list-properties
that I see.

I think glib's implementation is not thread safe on its own... consider two
threads invoke g_object_new() on the singleton without proper locking.  I
am guessing it could be relevant to glib's heavy event model.

And that's fundamentally what I want to have for QEMU's migration object,
so that it doesn't need locking on its own of the singleton idea: the
locking, if necessary, should be done in get_instance(), in this case.
So I did it wrong indeed in this current series at least there, where it
should need to take migration's new mutex, then take a refcount before
return, rightfully as Markus pointed out elsewhere.

The other concern I have with glib's singleton is, fundamentally
object_new() didn't really create a new object, which can be against the
gut feelings of whoever read it.  I'm not sure whether that's really what
we want.. or maybe that's only my own concern, so it might be subjective.

Thanks,
