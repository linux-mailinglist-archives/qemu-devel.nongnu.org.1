memory_region_new_* will work, but I don't think removing unnecessary 
but harmless fields from a device state structure does not sufficiently 
motivates adding them.

It still requires a trade-off that obscures the duration of MemoryRegion 
and may confuse Coverity or other tools. I also prefer the fields 
present in the state as I can be immediately sure they do not leak even 
without checking that the device is not hotpluggable.

I don't think it needs comments. It is a common pattern that 
MemoryRegions are directly referenced only at initialization and 
uninitialization. The presence of MemoryRegions in a device state 
structure only tells that they are alive as long as the device is alive, 
and does not imply that it is directly referenced later.
