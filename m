Trapping and emulating is fine.

My concern is really only about skipping SET_IRQ.

That works because of the assumption that the IMS sources are going to
re-use addr/data pairs setup in the MSI CAP.

That assumption is frail, and won't work at all under the proper IMS
support Linux now has.

I really don't want to go down the road and have someone tell Thomas
he can't convert the Linux driver to use irq_domain IMS because it
will break this stuff here.

It seems like you have reverse engineered alot of the necessary
information though??

Maybe there is a more generic approach than a variant driver. If you
wanted to use IMS from userspace generically you could imagine some
kind of IMS focused "SET_IRQ" in generic VFIO. Where we'd create the
needed irq_domains and pass the addr/data pair back to userspace?

Well at least that should be testable - but it seems crazy if the
device has registers for an addr/data pair and then somehow doesn't
use the values that get put in them??

Copying from the MSI is almost certainly a SW hack because IMS support
has never really existed in an OS until now. I think your guess for
why it is like this is pretty good.

To be clear, I'm not really worried about showing the data to
userspace.

Userspace just shouldn't be using it to implement an IMS technique!
