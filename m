Hi,

* If the channel does not set '_READ_MSG_SEEK' flag, which magic value
are we going to read? As for checking names of the channels, it tells
the reader how an incoming channel is processed.

* Yes, I did try to debug it but couldn't get to a conclusion in time.

* Sure, agreed. So far in my testing it does not seem to happen. The
theory of multifd_recv_threads getting scheduled out and causing guest
page over-write seems remote to me, but I get the
possibility/probability. One possible solution is to have the
destination side send an 'acknowledgement' to the source side.

* Well, passing unit tests should confirm that it does not break
existing functionality. Is there any metric/limit to such
understanding? Everybody understands/sees things differently.
Understanding is an ever evolving thing. Saying that merge should
happen based on understanding sounds weird to me.

* I guess we are seeing/understanding things differently here.

* After a 2nd thought - that's evolving understanding right there. :)

* To mention here, to flush multifd channels with
'multifd_ram_flush_and_sync()' I tried calling

       migration_iteration_run -> multifd_ram_flush_and_sync(s->to_dst_file)

It does not work, it crashes. Is 's->to_dst_file' a right parameter there?

But calling a function below works
===
/* Send enqueued data pages onto next available multifd channel */
int multifd_send_flush(void)
{
    if (!multifd_payload_empty(multifd_ram_send)) {
        if (!multifd_send(&multifd_ram_send)) {
            error_report("%s: multifd_send fail", __func__);
            return -1;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
===
    migration_iteration_run -> multifd_send_flush()

Works, but it is not sending the 'RAM_SAVE_FLAG_MULTIFD_FLUSH' message
as done by 'multifd_ram_flush_and_sync()' function.

* Yes, the revised patch is working with the
assert(!migrate_in_postcopy) in multifd_recv_thread.

* I was going to send a revised series with these changes, but will
wait on that for now.

Thank you.
