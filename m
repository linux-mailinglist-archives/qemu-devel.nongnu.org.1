Yes. That is the intent. Why the spec requires this distinction is a long
story we won't go into here...

Agreed. For this check, if we are changing it we should update it to
incorporate the additional FM_API commands so < 0x59 to include the
various CXL fabrics things that have been added.

Ok.  I was going to suggest a separate header to avoid info about mailboxes
that wasn't relevant bleeding over into this mctp bridge device but that
header has very little in it so we should be fine. We can reorganizing things
in some future set if that header gains lots of other stuff.
