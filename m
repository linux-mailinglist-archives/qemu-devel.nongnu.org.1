I used both Qemu and actual hardware (having collie, poodle, tosa and
c860 that was easy).

The biggest issue with Zaurus PDAs was that supporting interesting
parts of the platform (PCMCIA, companion chips) required almost
rebootstrapping of the corresponding drivers.
E.g. I had a separate driver for the LoCoMo chip which worked properly
with the DT systems.
PCMCIA was a huuuge trouble and it didn't play well at all. The driver
must be rewritten to use the component framework.

lf there is interest in modernising / updating StrongARM / PXA
devices, please count me in. I don't have time to lead the effort, but
I'd like to contribute.

There were two projects that worked on reenabling phones and PDAs from
that era, hack'n'dev and handhelds.org. I think both of them were dead
when the Zaurus was still alive and kicking.
