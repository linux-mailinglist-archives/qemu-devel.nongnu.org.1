That depends heavily on your threat model. You can use a host provided 
variable store to gain variable persistence for things like boot 
variables and then have an ephemeral SVSM based TPM that you use to 
measure the loaded payloads. A malicious host can already replace your 
root volume, so extending the threat to variables is not the end of the 
world.

You get to know the new virtual address, but ConvertPointer never tells 
you what the new *physical* address is. That means you have no idea 
where to DMA from once you're in virtual land. Most OSs just keep a 1:1 
map of virtual to physical, but MacOS does not.

Yes. Or converge on this protocol instead to simplify the firmware 
implementation so we don't create needless work if someone wants to do 
an actually trivial (and reusable?) UEFI firmware for BYOF.
