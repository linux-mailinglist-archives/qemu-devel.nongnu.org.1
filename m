I think QEMU's answer would be to not bother trying todo this at all,
just expose '-cpu SapphireRapids', because there's no functional benefit
to overriding the model ID, when all the CPUID features are identical.

Those who have the guest to see the *perfect* functional match of the
host still have '-cpu host' available.

The named CPU models are for the case where we want a rough approximation
for a CPU generation available, to easy migration across mixed CPU clusters.
Given the intent is to have a rough approximation, there's no compelling
reason to add an exact EmeraldRapids named CPU.

Historically we have generally only added new CPU models if there was
a feature difference. We've skipped adding many of the Intel models
that didn't add bring new features, on the basis that there is no
compelling functional need to have them.
