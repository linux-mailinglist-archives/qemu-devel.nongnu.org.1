The reason I ask is because on bare metal, I'm pretty sure SGX is incompatible
with true CPU hotplug.  It can work for the virtualization case, but I wouldn't
be all that surprised if the answer here is "don't do that".

Yeah, it's a newer thing.  5.6+ should initialize IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL if it's
left unlocked (commit 1db2a6e1e29f ("x86/intel: Initialize IA32_FEAT_CTL MSR at boot").

Heh, probably only because the VM isn't actively using KVM at the time of hotplug.
In pre-5.6 kernels, i.e. without the aforementioned handling, KVM (in the guest)
would refuse to load (though the hotplug would still work).  But if the guest is
actively running (nested) VMs at the time of hotplug, the hotplugged vCPUs would
hit a #GP when attempting to do VMXON, and would likely crash the kernel.

Generally speaking, firmware is expected to set and lock IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL.
But of course firmware doesn't always behave as expected, hence the hardening that
was added by commit 1db2a6e1e29f to avoid blowing up when running on weird/buggy
firmware.
