I have considered such an enum, as an input for the callback, as a
parameter of the registration function, and both. Of course, if you were
to add a selection parameter for the registration function, you likely
want OR-able flags.

An additional input for the callback type would obviously require a new
function type just for that callback. Since the callbacks are somewhat
similar to the VCPU init, exit, resume, ... ones it felt appropriate
to use the same function type for all of them.

As for the registration, it may make the registration a bit more
convenient and maybe keep the API clutter a bit lower, but not by that
much.

I don't think this is a good idea.

Traps are just too diverse, imo there is too little overlap between
different architectures, with the sole exception maybe being the PC
prior to the trap. "Interrupt id" sounds like a reasonably common
concept, but then you would need to define a mapping for each and every
architecture. What integer type do you use? In RISC-V, for example,
exceptions and interrupt "ids" are differentiated via the most
significant bit. Dou keep that or do you zero it? And then there's
ring/privilage mode, cause (sometimes for each mode), ...

It would also complicate call sites for hooks in target code. You'd
either need awkwardly long function signitures or setup code for that
struct. Both are things you don't want, as a hook call site should
never distract from the actual logic surrounding them. You could
probably have something reasonable in Rust, using a builder/command
pattern. But in C this would require too much boiler plate code than
I'd be comfortable with.

Regards,
Julian
