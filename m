I always get confused with terminologies when dealing with QEMU;
as the host can mean the actual host (which is x86_64 in my case)
and the guest would aarch64 Linux fully emulated by QEMU, and the
emulated guest can be considered a host and launch it’s guests wit
KVM for example. This also will be more fun with guests supporting
nested virtualization :)

For simplicity, I will consider:
- HOST: the fully emulated QEMU guest (aarch64) running on my machine.
- GUEST: Any guest launched by the HOST (through KVM for example)
- QEMU: Is the instance of QEMU emulating the HOST (built for x86)
- QEMU-VMM: Is the instance of QEMU running on the HOST (built for
  aarch64) which launches VMs(GUESTs).

With that, AFAIU, vSMMU is the SMMUv3 emulation used for GUESTs with
QEMU-VMM, where it has hooks in CMDQ and then the QEMU-VMM will issue
IOCTLs to the HOST to do the actual SMMU work (through iommufd or IIRC
there was previous patches from Eric that does that also), also the
vSMMU is out of tree AFAICT.

In that case, this work is orthogonal to that, the nested SMMUv3
emulation in this series mainly targets QEMU which is advertised
to the HOST, which then allows it to use iommufd with GUESts.

In theory, that work can be extended to QEMU-VMM with vSMMU, but
I guess that would be a lot of work as the VMM needs to collapse
both stages as the kernel provides only one address space for the VMM.

Mainly, I use this patches to test nesting patches I am hacking for
KVM, also they can be used with your patches to test iommufd with
needing hardware. (See testing section in the cover letter)

Are you referring to the iommufd work on Linux to support nesting?
