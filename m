Looking at this fresh, I'm left wondering why I didn't suggested
using 'QMP' to expose this information when reviewing the earlier
versions. I see Igor did indeed suggest this:

  https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2023-09/msg03905.html

Your commentry that "qom-list-properties" doesn't distinguish
between CPU features and other random QOM properties is bang
on the money.

I think what this highlights, is that 'qom-list-properties'
is a very poor design/fit for the problem that management apps
need to solve in this regard.

Libvirt should not need to manually exclude non-feature properties
like 'check' 'enforce' 'migratable' etc.

QEMU already has this knowledge, as IIUC, 'query-cpu-model-expansion'
can distinguish this:

query-cpu-model-expansion type=static model={'name':'Nehalem'}
{
    "return": {
        "model": {
            "name": "base",
            "props": {
                "3dnow": false,
                ...snip...
                "xtpr": false
            }
        }
    }
}

We still have the problem that we're not exposing the CPUID/MSR
leafs/register bits. So query-cpu-model-expansion isn't a fit
for the problem.

Rather than try to design something super general purpose, I'd
suggest we take a short cut and design something entirley x86
specific, and simply mark the QMP command as "unstable"
eg a 'x-query-x86-cpu-model-features', and then basically
report all the information libvirt needs there.

This is functionally equivalent to what you expose in the YAML
file, while still using QEMU's formal 'QMP' API mechanism, so
we avoid inventing a new API concept via YAML.

I think this would avoid need to have a code generator refactor
the CPU definitions too. We just need to expose the values of
the existing CPUID_xxx constants against each register.



With regards,
Daniel
