Should be possible.  Also for /sysfs we do a detection of domains, and
based on that register metrics and instances with pmcd.  For rapl-msr,
that could be done in a similiar way, i.e. as denki.rapl-msr,
or separating into denki.rapl.sysfs and denki.rapl.msr .

As for the actual doing, I'm not part of the engineering org but
support, so it's a spare time activity, when I get to it.  PCP
engineering has people on the project, a Jira would be a first step.
Direct pull requests to upstream are also a good start of course.  When
developing that, one would in cycles modify src/pmdas/denki/denki.c,
compile it, get pmcd to use the modified pmda-denki, look at debug
output and metrics.

I think we have these metrics in pmcd already from pmda-linux, i.e. we
can see them with this:
# pmrep -1gU -t 5 -J 3 proc.hog.cpu [..]
[ 1] - proc.hog.cpu["083377 /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox"]
[ 2] - proc.hog.cpu["084634 /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox"]
[ 3] - proc.hog.cpu["085225 md5sum"]
         1         2         3
     0.001     0.003    16.304
=3D> Top 3 consumers, process 3 is heaviest.
This uses derived metrics, computes from others, defined here:
$ cat /etc/pcp/derived/proc.conf
[..]
proc.hog.cpu =3D 100 * (rate(proc.psinfo.utime) + rate(proc.psinfo.stime)) =
/ (kernel.all.uptime - proc.psinfo.start_time)
proc.hog.cpu(oneline) =3D average percentage CPU utilization of each process
[..]

I was brainstorming with Nathan about this in the past, but we did
not quickly get to something and lost track. =20
Following the PCP approach, a client would query the required metrics
=66rom pmcd (i.e. "process md5sum is right now using most cpu cycles"),
and together with "the overall VM or bare-metal-system consumes right
now 100W", one could attribute.  We might get away with derived=20
metrics as per above.  If the computation is not doable with that, we
might also use own client code (i.e. C, or python) which gets the
metrics and computes the accounting per thread.
Last resort would be to collect the required process metrics in=20
pmda-denki for computation there.

We might want to take this one out and discuss on PCP upstream,
i.e. pcp@groups.io .

On this aarch64/Asahi macbook here, recent kernels made=20
/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon1 available, and 'sensors' offers:
[chris@asahi sensors]$ sensors
[..]
Total System Power:       7.71 W
AC Input Power:           9.99 W
3.8 V Rail Power:         0.00 W
Heatpipe Power:           2.46 W
[..]

I'm still wondering how these fit into a picture like this one:
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/christianhorn/smallhelper=
s/blob/main/pmda-denki-handbook/denki.html#_hardware_requirements_new_versi=
on
So with these also overall system consumption is available while AC
powered - of course, just that hardware right now.

The only request would be that implementing that is "an optional ontop
source", so not preventing MSR access from bare metal hosts not having
it.  I guess that's given.  So then it's an abstracted channel we
provide into the guest.

> Or is there a preferred way for PCP to do inter-process comms?

Hm.. I thought this was here used to communicate between host and guest?

On the good side, if we get the per-thread-attribution done, we can
illustrate attribution up into guests with what mermaid calls sankey:
https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/sankey.html  :)
