Some amount of flexibility needs to be baked in. For instance, what
about the handshake procedure? Don't we want to use multifd threads to
put some information on the wire for that as well?

Is that an union up there? So you want to simply allocate in multifd the
max amount of memory between the two types of payload? But then we'll
need a memset(p->data, 0, ...) at every round of sending to avoid giving
stale data from one client to another. That doesn't work with the
current ram migration because it wants p->pages to remain active across
several calls of multifd_queue_page().

This is the packet, a different thing. Not sure if your paragraph above
means to talk about that or really MultifdDeviceState, which is what is
exchanged between the multifd threads and the client code.
