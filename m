Ah. I'd missunderstood.

I think we need a way to back out extents from the pending to add list
so we can create the race where they are offered to the OS and it takes
forever to accept and by the time it does we've removed them.

Ah. I'd missed the fact you store into the extent without a check on validity
but only move the index on if they were valid. Then rely on not passing a trailing
entry at the end.
If would be more readable I think if local variables were used for the parameters
until we've decided not to skip and the this ended with

        if (!skip_extent) {
            extents[i] = (DCXLDCExtentRaw) {
                .start_dpa = ...
	        ...
            };
            i++
        }
We have local len already so probably just need
uint64_t start_dpa = offset + dcd->dc.regions[rid].base;

Also maybe skip_extent_evlog or something like that to explain we are only
skipping that part. 
Helps people like me who read it completely wrong!
