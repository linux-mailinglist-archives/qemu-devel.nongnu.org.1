+Using Multiple ``IOThread``\ s
+==============================
+
+..
+   Copyright (c) 2014-2017 Red Hat Inc.
+
+   This work is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL, version 2 or later.  See
+   the COPYING file in the top-level directory.
+
+
+This document explains the ``IOThread`` feature and how to write code that runs
+outside the BQL.
+
+The main loop and ``IOThread``\ s
+---------------------------------
+QEMU is an event-driven program that can do several things at once using an
+event loop.  The VNC server and the QMP monitor are both processed from the
+same event loop, which monitors their file descriptors until they become
+readable and then invokes a callback.
+
+The default event loop is called the main loop (see ``main-loop.c``).  It is
+possible to create additional event loop threads using
+``-object iothread,id=my-iothread``.
+
+Side note: The main loop and ``IOThread`` are both event loops but their code is
+not shared completely.  Sometimes it is useful to remember that although they
+are conceptually similar they are currently not interchangeable.
+
+Why ``IOThread``\ s are useful
+------------------------------
+``IOThread``\ s allow the user to control the placement of work.  The main loop is a
+scalability bottleneck on hosts with many CPUs.  Work can be spread across
+several ``IOThread``\ s instead of just one main loop.  When set up correctly this
+can improve I/O latency and reduce jitter seen by the guest.
+
+The main loop is also deeply associated with the BQL, which is a
+scalability bottleneck in itself.  vCPU threads and the main loop use the BQL
+to serialize execution of QEMU code.  This mutex is necessary because a lot of
+QEMU's code historically was not thread-safe.
+
+The fact that all I/O processing is done in a single main loop and that the
+BQL is contended by all vCPU threads and the main loop explain
+why it is desirable to place work into ``IOThread``\ s.
+
+The experimental ``virtio-blk`` data-plane implementation has been benchmarked and
+shows these effects:
+ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/linux/pdfs/KVM_Virtualized_IO_Performance_Paper.pdf
+
+.. _how-to-program:
+
+How to program for ``IOThread``\ s
+----------------------------------
+The main difference between legacy code and new code that can run in an
+``IOThread`` is dealing explicitly with the event loop object, ``AioContext``
+(see ``include/block/aio.h``).  Code that only works in the main loop
+implicitly uses the main loop's ``AioContext``.  Code that supports running
+in ``IOThread``\ s must be aware of its ``AioContext``.
+
+AioContext supports the following services:
+ * File descriptor monitoring (read/write/error on POSIX hosts)
+ * Event notifiers (inter-thread signalling)
+ * Timers
+ * Bottom Halves (BH) deferred callbacks
+
+There are several old APIs that use the main loop AioContext:
+ * LEGACY ``qemu_aio_set_fd_handler()`` - monitor a file descriptor
+ * LEGACY ``qemu_aio_set_event_notifier()`` - monitor an event notifier
+ * LEGACY ``timer_new_ms()`` - create a timer
+ * LEGACY ``qemu_bh_new()`` - create a BH
+ * LEGACY ``qemu_bh_new_guarded()`` - create a BH with a device re-entrancy guard
+ * LEGACY ``qemu_aio_wait()`` - run an event loop iteration
+
+Since they implicitly work on the main loop they cannot be used in code that
+runs in an ``IOThread``.  They might cause a crash or deadlock if called from an
+``IOThread`` since the BQL is not held.
+
+Instead, use the ``AioContext`` functions directly (see ``include/block/aio.h``):
+ * ``aio_set_fd_handler()`` - monitor a file descriptor
+ * ``aio_set_event_notifier()`` - monitor an event notifier
+ * ``aio_timer_new()`` - create a timer
+ * ``aio_bh_new()`` - create a BH
+ * ``aio_bh_new_guarded()`` - create a BH with a device re-entrancy guard
+ * ``aio_poll()`` - run an event loop iteration
+
+The ``qemu_bh_new_guarded``/``aio_bh_new_guarded`` APIs accept a
+``MemReentrancyGuard``
+argument, which is used to check for and prevent re-entrancy problems. For
+BHs associated with devices, the reentrancy-guard is contained in the
+corresponding ``DeviceState`` and named ``mem_reentrancy_guard``.
+
+The ``AioContext`` can be obtained from the ``IOThread`` using
+``iothread_get_aio_context()`` or for the main loop using
+``qemu_get_aio_context()``. Code that takes an ``AioContext`` argument
+works both in ``IOThread``\ s or the main loop, depending on which ``AioContext``
+instance the caller passes in.
+
+How to synchronize with an ``IOThread``
+---------------------------------------
+Variables that can be accessed by multiple threads require some form of
+synchronization such as ``qemu_mutex_lock()``, ``rcu_read_lock()``, etc.
+
+``AioContext`` functions like ``aio_set_fd_handler()``,
+``aio_set_event_notifier()``, ``aio_bh_new()``, and ``aio_timer_new()``
+are thread-safe. They can be used to trigger activity in an ``IOThread``.
+
+Side note: the best way to schedule a function call across threads is to call
+``aio_bh_schedule_oneshot()``.
+
+The main loop thread can wait synchronously for a condition using
+``AIO_WAIT_WHILE()``.
+
+``AioContext`` and the block layer
+----------------------------------
+The ``AioContext`` originates from the QEMU block layer, even though nowadays
+``AioContext`` is a generic event loop that can be used by any QEMU subsystem.
+
+The block layer has support for ``AioContext`` integrated.  Each
+``BlockDriverState`` is associated with an ``AioContext`` using
+``bdrv_try_change_aio_context()`` and ``bdrv_get_aio_context()``.
+This allows block layer code to process I/O inside the
+right ``AioContext``.  Other subsystems may wish to follow a similar approach.
+
+Block layer code must therefore expect to run in an ``IOThread`` and avoid using
+old APIs that implicitly use the main loop.  See
+`How to program for IOThreads`_ for information on how to do that.
+
+Code running in the monitor typically needs to ensure that past
+requests from the guest are completed.  When a block device is running
+in an ``IOThread``, the ``IOThread`` can also process requests from the guest
+(via ioeventfd).  To achieve both objects, wrap the code between
+``bdrv_drained_begin()`` and ``bdrv_drained_end()``, thus creating a "drained
+section".
+
+Long-running jobs (usually in the form of coroutines) are often scheduled in
+the ``BlockDriverState``'s ``AioContext``.  The functions
+``bdrv_add``/``remove_aio_context_notifier``, or alternatively
+``blk_add``/``remove_aio_context_notifier`` if you use ``BlockBackends``,
+can be used to get a notification whenever ``bdrv_try_change_aio_context()``
+moves a ``BlockDriverState`` to a different ``AioContext``.
