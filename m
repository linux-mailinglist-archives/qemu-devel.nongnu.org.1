So, my issue with this is that it's x86 specific, and it adds
yet another monitor command that is doing "show some kind of debug
info related to the guest page tables", along with "info mem"
and "info tlb". Plus it is yet another lump of code that's
walking the guest page tables and interpreting them.

What I'd really like to see is some infrastructure that is
at least somewhat guest-architecture-agnostic, so we can
minimise what a guest architecture needs to implement (and
then make providing that mandatory).

The other thing I'd like to see is perhaps some investigation of
whether there's any way to implement something useful by
using/extending the existing get_phys_page_attrs_debug() and
similar functions, so that you don't have to write one lot
of page-table-walking code for QEMU to use when it's executing
guest code and a separate lot (that's bound to get out of
sync or not support new functionality/changes) that's only
handling these monitor debug commands. There's a lot of
complexity in figuring out things like permissions in a
modern architecture...

thanks
