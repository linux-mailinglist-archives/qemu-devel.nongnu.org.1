Well, you need to rebase this series without that then as I'm not going
to take something another long time project contributor said was wrong
and offered lots of constructive feedback on.

I saw that Jerome posted sandbox for lwip as well and was pleased. You
can pickup whatever is left and move forward once both your current
series and his have been merged.

Eh? v4 as-is needs to be rebased to mainline. That you didn't make it
against mainline but instead your tree is why this wasn't merged
already.

I guess you missed the email where I told you what was assigned to you
in patchwork and could easily be put in a pull request by you to me to
get to mainline.
