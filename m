Thanks Daniel for stepping in on the explanation.

I'm aware of the MSR/TPMI RAPL that will appear in the future, and=20
I would like to share my perspective on that.

Firstly, we can safely assume that it will take years before all server=20
hardware is transitioned to the new GNR (or future XEON without RAPL=20
MSR). It may be around 2024 when these features could be integrated into=20
QEMU. While the adoption of this feature might take some time, I'm=20
optimistic that once it's implemented, people will finally have the=20
tools to optimize workloads inside VMs and start reducing power=20
consumption.

Secondly, the second-hand server market is substantial. This means that=20
with the Virtual RAPL MSR, all XEON processors starting from Sandy=20
Bridge (2012!) will have the potential for software optimization. Making=20
the most of existing resources is essential for sustainability.

Lastly, when the TPMI becomes available in hardware in the future, the=20
RAPL interface and ratio calculation will remain the same, with only the=20
method of obtaining host values changing. This transition should be=20
manageable.

Regards,
Anthony
