David: why do we need to drop PRIVATE in ramblock flags?  I thought it was
pretty harmless.  I suppose things like qemu_ram_is_shared() will even keep
working as before?

It looks ok to remove it too, but it adds logics that doesn't seem
necessary to me, so just to double check if I missed something..
