We can't rely on the sanitizers to catch all cases where we're casting
functions, as we don't have good enough code coverage in tests to
identify all places that way.

Unless there's a warning flag we can use to get diagnosis of this
problem at compile time and then fix all reported issues, I won't have
any confidence in our ability to remove -fsanitize-cfi-icall-generalize-pointers
for CFI.

That's my recommendation for the short term.

Daniel
