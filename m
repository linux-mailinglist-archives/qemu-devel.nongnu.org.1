This issue was raised by Stefan Hajnoczi in one of the first
iterations of this patchset, based upon previous David Gilbert's work
on the virtiofs DAX Window.

Let me paste here some of his remarks:

"""
Other backends don't see these mappings. If the guest submits a vring
descriptor referencing a mapping to another backend, then that backend
won't be able to access this memory.
"""
[...]
"""
A bit more detail:

Device A has a VIRTIO Shared Memory Region. An application mmaps that
memory (examples: guest userspace driver using Linux VFIO, a guest
kernel driver that exposes the memory to userspace via mmap, or guest
kernel DAX). The application passes that memory as an I/O buffer to
device B (e.g. O_DIRECT disk I/O).

The result is that device B's vhost-user backend receives a vring
descriptor that points to a guest memory address in device A's VIRTIO
Shared Memory Region. Since device B does not have this memory in its
table, it cannot translate the address and the device breaks.
"""

I have not triggered the issue myself. So the idea is that the next
patch will *definitively* include some testing for the commits that I
cannot verify with my local setup.

BR,
Albert.
