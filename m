Let me recap the problem.  Please correct my misunderstandings, if any.

Hard disks can have almost arbitrary sizes.  Almost, because it still
needs to be a multiple of the block size.

Floppy disks have one of a small set of well-known sizes.

I vaguely recall that we generally derive the device's actual size from
the backend's size.

Some devices reject certain sizes.  For instance, SD cards require a
power of 2.

Most devices seem to accept anything.  I can create an IDE, SCSI, or
floppy disk backed by a raw image of one byte.  I have no idea how it
would behave.

As is, the vvfat backend can only do certain sizes, configurable with
parameters @floppy and @fat-type.  They work for floppies, but not for
SD cards, since they're not powers of two.

Instead of deriving size and CHS from @floppy and @fat-type, Cl=C3=A9ment
proposes to specify the size (and derive fat-type and CHS[*]?).

In QMP, we specify the size in bytes.  This is fine regardless of size;
management applications don't mind sending things like "size": 1474560.

In HMP and the command line, big byte sizes are inconvenient.  That's
why we support suffixes there.  size=3D256M is a fine way to pick an SD
card's size.

The size suffixes seem inconvenient for floppies, though.  For instance,
2 heads * 80 tracks * 18 sectors * 512 bytes =3D 1474560 bytes =3D 1440
KiBytes, but size=3D1.44M does not work: 1.44 MiBytes =3D 1509949.44 Bytes.
However, size=3D1440K does.

This leads me to suggest to simply stick to numeric size, and use
appropriate suffixes.  These are obvious enough for anything but
floppies.  So advise users "use K for floppies"[**].

If this isn't good enough, I can help you explore fancier parts of QAPI,
such as alternate types.




[*] I guess we could support specifying an optional fat-type in addition
to size, and derive only CHS then.

[**] Even for a hypothetical floppy with an odd number of 512 byte
sectors: .5K works, because .5 * 1024 is an integer.
