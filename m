I am busy with my research these days, until around mid December. After 
that I may try to implement following idea:


    https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0487/latest/
    B2.9.5 Load-Exclusive and Store-Exclusive instruction usage
    restrictions

    But you could do the same thing, aligning and recording the entire
    128-bit quantity, then extract the ll.d result based on address bit
    6. This would complicate the implementation of sc.d as well, but
    would perhaps bring us "close enough" to the actual architecture.

    Note that our Arm store-exclusive implementation isn't quite in spec
    either.  There is quite a large comment within translate-a64.c
    store_exclusive() about the ways things are not quite right.  But it
    seems to be close enough for actual usage to succeed.

                            Then a possible implementation of gen_ll()
                            would be: align base to 128-bit boundary,
                            read 128-bit from memory, save 64-bit part
                            to rd and record whole 128-bit data in
                            llval. Then, in gen_sc_q(), it uses a
                            128-bit cmpxchg.

                          It would be worth asking your hardware
                          engineers about the bounds of legal behaviour.
                          Ideally there would be some very explicit

                    ll.d-dbar-ld.d sequence and translate the sequence
                    into one tcg_gen_qemu_ld_i128 and split the result
                    into two 64-bit parts. Can do this in QEMU?

                  I think we just need to implement sc.q. We don't need
                  to care about 'll.d-dbar-ld.d'. It's just like 'll.q'.

                  <br>
                  sc.q needs to
                  <br>
                  1) Use 64-bit cmpxchg.
                  <br>
                  2) Write 128 bits to memory.

                If the memory content of base+8 has changed between ld.d

            The problem is that, the high value read here might not
            equal to the previously read one in ll.d r2, base 8
            instruction.

          I think dbar 0x7000 ensures that the 2 loads in 'll.q' are a
          128bit atomic operation.

        The code does work in real LoongArch machine. However, we are
        emulating LoongArch in qemu, we have to make it atomic, yet it
        isn't now.

        But you could do the same thing, aligning and recording the
        entire 128-bit quantity, then extract the ll.d result based on
        address bit 6. This would complicate the implementation of sc.d

        architecture.

        Note that our Arm store-exclusive implementation isn't quite in

        translate-a64.c store_exclusive() about the ways things are not
        quite right.  But it seems to be close enough for actual usage

                          There is quite a large comment within
                          translate-a64.c store_exclusive() about the
                          ways things are not quite right.  But it seems
                          to be close enough for actual usage to
                          succeed.
