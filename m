Yes, I agree don't need to set CPUID_EXT_MONITOR besides
kvm_arch_get_supported_cpuid().

Yes, I agree without MWAIT available and advertised, it's meaningless to
set the EMX and IBE bits. Seems to me it's cleaner to remove cpu->mwait
all together, and in cpu_x86_cpuid(), just read from host_cpuid(5) if
MWAIT is available to the guest. But I don't understand the history of
why QEMU unconditionally advertises these two bits, and don't know it it
could break some thing if these two bits are removed.

Even if we want to fix these two bits, we can do it in another separate
patch.

e737b32a36 (" Core 2 Duo specification (Alexander Graf).")
unconditionally adds "CPUID_MWAIT_EMX | CPUID_MWAIT_IBE" to CPUID.5.ECX
with further explanation.

2266d44311 ("i386/cpu: make -cpu host support monitor/mwait") adds
comment "We always wake on interrupt even if host does not have the
capability" to CPUID_MWAIT_IBE.

I agree it's good to have the warning as well.

I like the idea that QEMU refuses to launch the guest if the asked CPU
features are not available, which is more user friendly.  But the
problem is, "-overcommit cpu-pm=on" is an umbrella which intends to
enable all the following CPUIDs and KVM features if it's possible.  So,
if QEMU fails the guest in this case, then it needs to fail the WAITPKG
feature as well. Additionally, it may need to provide individual options
to enable these individual features, which I doubt could be too complicated.
