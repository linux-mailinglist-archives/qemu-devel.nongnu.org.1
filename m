I think you can't do that with -drive. You either do

-drive if=none,id=d,format=raw,file=raw.img -device whatever,drive=d

or try to have -drive create the device by specifying the type in if 
and hope it works such as

-drive if=virtio,format=raw,file=raw.img

and then you don't need corresponding device but this may not work for 
every machine. The -hda option should expand to such -drive option but it 
cannot if the machine does not define a default interface for block 
devices. So maybe just setting block_default_type in the MachineClass to 
IF_VIRTIO might be enough, otherwise you may need to implement handling 
for it in the machine. In the sam460ex I had to implement it because it 
uses SATA with only two ports which only takes one device per IDE bus 
while the default in QEMU expects PATA IDE that can have two devices per 
bus and two buses but for virtio maybe it works without additional 
handling of drives and only the default is missing which -hda would use.

I think you can only have empty cdrom devices which can be created without 
a drive option but not devices that don't have removable media. You also 
can't define a drive without a file or some other backing store.

Maybe you can try 'info block' in QEMU monitor to see what drives are 
defined and 'info qtree' to see what devices are attached to them. But if 
-hda option does not work this won't help, you can only check on other 
machines what -hda defines.
