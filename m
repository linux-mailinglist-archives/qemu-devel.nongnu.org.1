Ah that's ok.  And also I just noticed it may not be a big deal either as
long as we're before migration_incoming_process().

I'm wondering whether it can do it similarly like what we do with sockets
in qio_net_listener_set_client_func_full().  After all, rsocket wants to
mimic the socket API.  It'll make sense if rsocket code tries to match with
socket, or even reuse.

Yes we can wait for others' opinions.  And btw I'm not asking for it and I
don't think it'll be a blocker for this approach to land, as I said this is
better than the current code so it's definitely an improvement to me.

I'm purely curious, because if you're not going to do it for rdma, maybe
someday I'll try to do that, and I want to know what "big change" could be
as I didn't dig further.  It may help me by sharing what issues you've found.

Thanks,
