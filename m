I don't think there's a separate buffer for this on real card and the 
command FIFO is not long enough to store it so it should probably use 
vram. But how does it know which part of that can be used? Maybe you could 
write some pattern into HOST_DATAx registers (like 0xaaaaaaaa, 0x55555555 
but longer than the FIFO to make sure it's not staying there) and then 
before writing HOST_DATA_LAST look for that pattern in vram to see if it 
appears anywhere. Maybe some register points there or the card has some 
memory management I don't know about? (I don't know much about GPUs so 
it's quite possible I have no idea how it should work.) If the pattern is 
not found I don't have any better idea to find out how this should work. 
(We could keep the separate buffer in emulation for now but I'm curious 
how the real chip does it and if we can emulate that.)
