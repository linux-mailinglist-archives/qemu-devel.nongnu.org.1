Can we spell out what are these resources?

CPR definitely relies on completely shared memory.  That's already not a
concern.

CPR resolves resources that are bound to devices like VFIO by passing over
FDs, these are not over commited either.

Is it accounting QEMU/KVM process overhead?  That would really be trivial,
IMHO, but maybe something else?

We discussed about this one.  Personally I still cannot understand why this
is a concern if the agents can be trivially started as a new instance.  But
I admit I may not know the whole picture.  To me, the above point is more
persuasive, but I'll need to understand which part that is over-commited
that can be a problem.

After all, cloud hosts should preserve some extra memory anyway to make
sure dynamic resources allocations all the time (e.g., when live migration
starts, KVM pgtables can drastically increase if huge pages are enabled,
for PAGE_SIZE trackings), I assumed the over-commit portion should be less
that those.. and when it's also temporary (src QEMU will release all
resources after live upgrade) then it looks manageable.

The other thing is, as Vladimir is working on (looks like) a cleaner way of
passing FDs fully relying on unix sockets, I want to understand better on
the relationships of his work and the exec model.

I still personally think we should always stick with unix sockets, but I'm
open to be convinced on above limitations.  If exec is better than
cpr-transfer in any way, the hope is more people can and should adopt it.

We also have no answer yet on how cpr-exec can resolve container world with
seccomp forbidding exec.  I guess that's a no-go.  It's definitely a
downside instead.  Better mention that in the cover letter.

Thanks,
