mirror doesn't share BLK_PERM_RESIZE in its block_job_create() call, so
can this even happen? (If yes, that sounds bad.)

If the size is not explicitly overridden in the node configuration, I
would certainly expect that a raw node reflects the size of its file
node.

Seems this is exactly the condition that makes it use
BDRV_CHILD_FILTERED, so it would probably be a good change?

The traditional solution for nodes that unshare resize, but get resized
in the background anyway would be bs->drv = NULL, and we probably still
aren't certain what happens after that. :-)
