If any of us wants to make this working properly, we don't need to rush
removing or deprecating this. Instead we may want to discuss the proper
interface, using the new qmp cmd name that Markus suggested, then (maybe)
deprecate the old name only.

I proposed direct removal majorly because of the two things I mentioned in
the commit message as major design issues:

  (1) Migration threads are dynamic so created with short windows that
  they're not be able to be pinned by the mgmt.

  (2) Only sender threads are reported, while at least recv threads are
  equally important in this case.

I proposed direct removal not only because I want to avoid further fuss on
this API from any migration developer - I think we already spent more time
than we needed.. on this 100+ LOCs.  While, this can be reintroduced in the
proper way again when necessary easily.  Meanwhile I also wanted to avoid
new users see this API at all and use it ignoring dest threads even during
deprecation process.

Jiacheng is in the loop.  Jiacheng, do you want to chime in here?

Thanks,
