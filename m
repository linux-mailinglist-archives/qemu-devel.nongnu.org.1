Me neither (see for example the Meson transition which avoided
parallel implementations at all costs).

On the other hand, this series shows that it's hard to have a baseline
version earlier than 1.83.  The bindings got pretty far while
supporting older versions, and the few hacks needed were nice testbeds
for the build system and the procedural macro infrastructure, but the
improvements that const_refs_to_static provides for reflection are
just too big. And for Debian that means waiting until July 2027 before
making Rust mandatory, and for Ubuntu that's April 2028 based on the
current situation. I hope that the effort proves itself either valid
or unviable in less than 2-3 years. :)

Now, it's certainly not the only possibility:

1) If someone contributes devices that are written in Rust then we
could just drop the PL011 and/or HPET sample device. That's a pity but
they would survive in git history and could be resurrected later.

2) Using RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP[1] allows enabling unstable features even in
versions older than 1.83. Disadvantage: build system changes that will
be obsolete soon(ish), plus the relevant compiler code obviously
wasn't as tested as after stabilization. I'd prefer to avoid that, but
hey---Linux does it.

3) Affected distros could use RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP themselves if they want,
while upstream QEMU would only support rustup toolchains for Debian
bookworm and Ubuntu up to 24.10. This only requires
tests/lcitool/refresh changes, the disadvantage is that the project
would renege on the general promise that we make on platform support.

I agree. One more reason why "Let's Rewrite It In Rust" is more of a
necessary evil to bootstrap the creation of bindings, and not a good
idea in general.

I agree in principle, though theory and practice may diverge.
