It should still be able to reach zero if we skip the refcount of internal
MR subregions like what this patch does.

Said that, I think you're right..  the problem is we have object_deinit()
after object_property_del_all() (in object_finalize()), which means
memory_region_finalize() will be invoked before object_deinit()..  Then it
looks wrong now to delete subregions in a deinit() even if reachable,
because the MRs should have been freed..

Fair enough.

I'll send the patch out officially for review, with above point taken.

Akihiko, let me know anytime when you want to either add your SoB or take
over the ownership of the patch.  I'll be OK with it.
