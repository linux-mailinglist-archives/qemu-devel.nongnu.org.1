The idea was to enable "most" extensions for the virt machine. It's a
bit wishy-washy, but the idea was to enable as much as possible by
default on the virt machine, as long as it doesn't conflict. The goal
being to allow users to get the "best" experience as all their
favourite extensions are enabled.

It's harder to do in practice, so we are in a weird state where users
don't know what is and isn't enabled.

We probably want to revisit this. We should try to enable what is
useful for users and make it clear what is and isn't enabled. I'm not
clear on how best to do that though.

Again, I think this comes back to we need to version the virt machine.
I might do that as a starting point, that allows us to make changes in
a clear way.

The max CPU helps, but I do feel that the default should allow users
to experience as many RISC-V extensions/features as practical.
