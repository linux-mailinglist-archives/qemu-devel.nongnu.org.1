This would work for guest interrupt file mappings, but MRIFs won't work
and the note of the "Device contexts at an IOMMU" section of the AIA spec
points out that VCPU migration may become more difficult to manage.

Yes, it certainly helps, thank you. It points out that step 17 of "Process
to translate an IOVA" produces a GPA which is consumed by step 18 for the
MSI translation (and there's no other way to get to step 18). OIOW, we
must do a first-stage translation before we check the MSI page table,
which means we can't do an early MSI check unless we have strictly !en_s.

This is unfortunate, considering the current state of VFIO+irqbypass and
the IOMMU driver. I also wonder if it's really necessary. It seems to me
that the MSI page table should always be checked first when either S-stage
or G-stage is Bare (so there's only a single-stage of translation) and
msiptp.MODE is not Off. I can't see what harm could come from that and it
would give system software the ability to leverage code that already knows
how to manage single-stage IOMMUs for device assignment.

Thanks,
