What you describe is this:

p->data = g_malloc(sizeof(MultiFDPayloadType) +
                   max(sizeof(MultiFDPages_t) + sizeof(ram_addr_t) * page_count,
                       sizeof(MultiFDDevice_t)));

This pushes the payload specific information into multifd_send_setup()
which is against what we've been doing, namely isolating payload
information out of multifd main code.

I think this is off the table, we're looking into allowing multifd
packet size to change. Page size can change as well.

Also future payload types might need to add dynamically allocated data
to the payload. Although it might be ok if we have a rule that
everything in the payload needs to be static, it just seems unnecessary.

The object being larger than the union is not the point. The point is we
don't know what size that array will have, because that's
client-specific data. Say RAM code wants an array of X size, vmstate
might need another of Y size, etc.

That's a stretch. multifd-channels is a migration parameter, it's fine
if any code has access to it.

I'm not sure. I'll try some alternatives first. Maybe the a[] approach
is not so bad. More below...

Both are ways of making a dynamically sized structure. We allocate them
with:

s = malloc(sizeof(struct) + n * sizeof(int));

a[0] is the older way and full of issues:

 - sizeof might return 0 or 1 depending on compiler extensions
 
 - the compiler can't tell when the array is not at the end of the struct
 
 - I'm not sure putting this inside an usion is well defined. gcc docs
   mention:
 
   "Declaring zero-length arrays in other contexts, including as interior
   members of structure objects or as non-member objects, is
   discouraged. Accessing elements of zero-length arrays declared in such
   contexts is undefined and may be diagnosed." --
   https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Zero-Length.html
 
 - the kernel has deprecated this usage entirely:
 
  "...this led to other problems ... like not being able to detect when
  such an array is accidentally being used _not_ at the end of a
  structure (which could happen directly, or when such a struct was in
  unions, structs of structs, etc)." --
  https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.16/process/deprecated.html#zero-length-and-one-element-arrays

a[] is the modern way and doesn't have the issues above, but it's still
not a perfect solution for us:

- note above how allocation doesn't reference "a" directly, which means
  we need to know "n" at the time of allocating p->data. This requires
  the sizeof mess I mentioned at the beginning.

- the array needs to be at the end of the structure, so we can only have
  one of them per payload.

- I have no idea how this would work if more than one payload needed an
  array like that.

I'll give this one a shot and see how it looks. I'm getting tired of
looking at this code.
