The mdts value is a prameter you can set at the command line. The 512k
default is really pretty reasonable, but you can set it up to 2MB
(mdts=9) if you want before hitting a different software limit that
won't let you go any higher. So rather than patch the device, I'd
recommend you just modify your startup command line parameters instead.

Not sure if it's still the case, but there was a time when Windows
Storport's maximum IO size had been limited to 128k, and that's exactly
what many nvme devices reported for MDTS, so Windows is certainly
supposed to work correctly with such values.
