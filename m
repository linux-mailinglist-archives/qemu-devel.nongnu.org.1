Yes that'll work too.  The important bit here is I think we should start to
seriously evaluate which to expose to QAPI as stable API when we add stats
into it.  We used to not pay too much attention.

With MigrationInfoOptional, we should suggest any new field to be added
there by default, then whatever needs to be put out of experimental needs
explicit justifications.  Or we can also document any new migration field
at least in the stats to be marked as experimental unless justified.

To my initial thoughts, I want Libvirt to fetch it.  However I don't want
Libvirt to parse it.

For example, for things like "whether zerocopy send succeeded or not", or
"how much time we spent on sending non-iterable device states", they're
almost not consumable for users, but great for debuggings.  It would be
great if Libvirt could know their existance, fetch it (e.g. once after
migration completes) then dump it to the logfile to help debugging and
triaging QEMU issues.  In that case parsing is not needed, the whole result
can be attached to the log as a JSON blob.  That releases the burden from
the need to maintain compatibility that we don't really need and nobody
cared (I bet it's the case here for zerocopy stats, but we got restricted
by our promises even if it may ultimately benefit nobody..).
