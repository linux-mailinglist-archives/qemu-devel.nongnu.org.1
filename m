I guess the answer is "depends", and to get a more useful one, we need
more information.

When all you care is time from executing qemu-system-FOO to guest
finish booting, and the guest takes 10s to boot, then an extra 0.2s
won't matter much.

When a management application runs qemu-system-FOO several times to
probe its capabilities via QMP, then even milliseconds can hurt.

In what scenarios exactly is QMP delayed?

You told us an absolute delay you observed.  What's the relative delay,
i.e. what's the delay with and without these patches?

We need QMP to become available earlier in the startup sequence for
other reasons.  Could we bypass the delay that way?  Please understand
that this would likely be quite difficult: we know from experience that
messing with the startup sequence is prone to introduce subtle
compatility breaks and even bugs.

That's well outside my bailiwick :)
