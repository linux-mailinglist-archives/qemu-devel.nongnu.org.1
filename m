The kernel can tell us which ID register fields are writable (we won't
generate properties if we don't.) For FEAT_xxx, this depends on how
we'll end up handling them (maybe we should only expose them if all ID
register bits backing them are actually writable.)

What worries me a bit is that QEMU exposing a certain set of FEAT_xxx
values could be interpreted as "those features are present, any other
features aren't", while it is only the list of configurable features.

Another issue: If libvirt is trying to baseline two cpus, it might end
up creating a model that looks sane on paper, but migrations will fail
because there are differences in non-writable bits. It would be much
better if libvirt could detect beforehand that there was no common
determinator. Not yet sure how to handle this.
