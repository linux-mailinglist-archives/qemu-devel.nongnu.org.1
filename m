I think the first step should replace the two g_autoptr() by
error_free(), then delete g_autoptr() support.

A possible second step is to replace migrate_set_error() by a function
that takes ownership.  "Replace" because I think migrate_set_error()
would be a bad name for such a function.  What's a better name?  Naming
is hard...  migrate_error_propagate_to_state()?  Because there's
similarity:

    error_propagate(errp, err);

stores @err in @errp, or else frees it, and

    migrate_error_propagate_to_state(s, err)

stores @err in @s, or else frees it.

We could also forgo encapsulation and simply use

    error_propagate(&s->error, err);

Matter of taste, which means migration maintainers decide.

I can do just the first step, or both.  Up to you.
