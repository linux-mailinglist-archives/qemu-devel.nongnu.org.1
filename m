Understand.

So, it will look like

# @backend-transfer: List of devices IDs or QOM paths, to enable
#     backend-transfer for. In general that means that backend
#     states and their file descriptors are passed to the destination
#     in the migration channel (which must be a UNIX socket), and
#     management tool doesn't have to configure new backends for
#     target QEMU (like vhost-user server, or TAP device in the kernel).
#     Default is no backend-transfer migration (Since 10.2)


Peter, is it OK for you?
