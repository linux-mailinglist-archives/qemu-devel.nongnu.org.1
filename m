Hi Pierrick,

>=20I agree. If for a specific event it's impossible to provide a value (=
i.e. the value has no meaning for a real cpu), it will just point that we=
 need several types of data per event, and the compromise of having a sin=
gle callback won't be possible.
>=20
>=20We should differentiate "it's hard to find this value in QEMU" vs "th=
is value does not exist in real life". The first can be solved if we put =
effort into it. And every time a cpu changes it's flow of execution, it m=
akes sense to find where it was just before.
>=20
>=20One of the end goals is to be able to build a full control flow graph=
, with edges labeled on transition type (exceptions, traps, interrupts, j=
ump, fallback), which we can do with the triple {event,from,to}.

I agree that that triple is sensible for any event type and likely
useful to plugin authors. At least if the semantics are sufficiently
uniform among event types. However, I also feel that given the actual
implementation (hooks sprinkled over target specific code) this is not
easily achievable reliably. At least testability should be a hard
requirement. Otherwise the API's reliability will inevitably deteriorate
over time without any way to tell how bad the situation got.

>=20It's an interesting conversation. For the scope of this series, I agr=
ee you should use the jump target, which triggered the trap.
>=20
>=20In fine, transitions should simply follow what the cpu does.

>=20
>=20In the case of a double trap, we could follow the same logic, and rep=
resent the original transition that lead to the trap, and the two consecu=
tive traps.
>=20
>=20Does it make sense?

Yes, those transitions are correct imo. And if a jump event should be
introduced at some point, the call sequence would look like that. My
issue is that testing this (in a plugin) will not be straight forward
or even impossible. And overly complex tests don't exactly provoke
confidence.

Julian Ganz
