My rationale for the OnOffAuto change is that "flipping ON to OFF 
automatically" is more confusing than making users specify AUTO to allow 
QEMU making the feature OFF. "ON" will always make the boot fail.

The ABI guarantee will be gone anyway if 
x-virtio-net-offload-enforce=off. AUTO is no different in that sense.
