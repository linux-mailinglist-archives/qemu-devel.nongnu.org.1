Just to confirm, are you suggesting that the patch should include a
commit message?  I apologize for submitting the patch without any
sufficient explanation.  However, I am not entirely sure if "how I
found these typos" needs to be included in the commit message.  For
your information, I discovered these typos because the ASCII art did
not align with the explanations (yes, a close read).

Oh, I misunderstood the original explanation.  I will correct it just by
adding the missing parenthesis instead.

I will send V2 with a decent explanation and the corrected typo fix.

Kind regards,
