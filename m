Sorry for my misunderstanding. The bridge control register in PCI bridge
config space determines forwarding VGA IO/MMIO accesses to which device,
BAR is not related in this process.

As device initialization (by legacy VBIOS) is required for booting
legacy OS with seabios, limiting legacy mode to gen9 and older sounds
resonable.

Trying VGA framebuffer would be difficult we have to disable EFI GOP and
manually instruct the device to enter VGA mode without VBIOS routines.
It's not a major problem here, let's skip it for now?

Thanks,
Moeko
