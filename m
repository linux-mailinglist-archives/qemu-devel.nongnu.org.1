-/* ARM has the following "translation regimes" (as the ARM ARM calls them):
- *
- * If EL3 is 64-bit:
- *  + NonSecure EL1 & 0 stage 1
- *  + NonSecure EL1 & 0 stage 2
- *  + NonSecure EL2
- *  + NonSecure EL2 & 0   (ARMv8.1-VHE)
- *  + Secure EL1 & 0 stage 1
- *  + Secure EL1 & 0 stage 2 (FEAT_SEL2)
- *  + Secure EL2 (FEAT_SEL2)
- *  + Secure EL2 & 0 (FEAT_SEL2)
- *  + Realm EL1 & 0 stage 1 (FEAT_RME)
- *  + Realm EL1 & 0 stage 2 (FEAT_RME)
- *  + Realm EL2 (FEAT_RME)
- *  + EL3
- * If EL3 is 32-bit:
- *  + NonSecure PL1 & 0 stage 1
- *  + NonSecure PL1 & 0 stage 2
- *  + NonSecure PL2
- *  + Secure PL1 & 0
- * (reminder: for 32 bit EL3, Secure PL1 is *EL3*, not EL1.)
- *
- * For QEMU, an mmu_idx is not quite the same as a translation regime because:
- *  1. we need to split the "EL1 & 0" and "EL2 & 0" regimes into two mmu_idxes,
- *     because they may differ in access permissions even if the VA->PA map is
- *     the same
- *  2. we want to cache in our TLB the full VA->IPA->PA lookup for a stage 1+2
- *     translation, which means that we have one mmu_idx that deals with two
- *     concatenated translation regimes [this sort of combined s1+2 TLB is
- *     architecturally permitted]
- *  3. we don't need to allocate an mmu_idx to translations that we won't be
- *     handling via the TLB. The only way to do a stage 1 translation without
- *     the immediate stage 2 translation is via the ATS or AT system insns,
- *     which can be slow-pathed and always do a page table walk.
- *     The only use of stage 2 translations is either as part of an s1+2
- *     lookup or when loading the descriptors during a stage 1 page table walk,
- *     and in both those cases we don't use the TLB.
- *  4. we can also safely fold together the "32 bit EL3" and "64 bit EL3"
- *     translation regimes, because they map reasonably well to each other
- *     and they can't both be active at the same time.
- *  5. we want to be able to use the TLB for accesses done as part of a
- *     stage1 page table walk, rather than having to walk the stage2 page
- *     table over and over.
- *  6. we need separate EL1/EL2 mmu_idx for handling the Privileged Access
- *     Never (PAN) bit within PSTATE.
- *  7. we fold together most secure and non-secure regimes for A-profile,
- *     because there are no banked system registers for aarch64, so the
- *     process of switching between secure and non-secure is
- *     already heavyweight.
- *  8. we cannot fold together Stage 2 Secure and Stage 2 NonSecure,
- *     because both are in use simultaneously for Secure EL2.
- *
- * This gives us the following list of cases:
- *
- * EL0 EL1&0 stage 1+2 (aka NS PL0 PL1&0 stage 1+2)
- * EL1 EL1&0 stage 1+2 (aka NS PL1 PL1&0 stage 1+2)
- * EL1 EL1&0 stage 1+2 +PAN (aka NS PL1 P1&0 stage 1+2 +PAN)
- * EL0 EL2&0
- * EL2 EL2&0
- * EL2 EL2&0 +PAN
- * EL2 (aka NS PL2)
- * EL3 (aka AArch32 S PL1 PL1&0)
- * AArch32 S PL0 PL1&0 (we call this EL30_0)
- * AArch32 S PL1 PL1&0 +PAN (we call this EL30_3_PAN)
- * Stage2 Secure
- * Stage2 NonSecure
- * plus one TLB per Physical address space: S, NS, Realm, Root
- *
- * for a total of 16 different mmu_idx.
- *
- * R profile CPUs have an MPU, but can use the same set of MMU indexes
- * as A profile. They only need to distinguish EL0 and EL1 (and
- * EL2 for cores like the Cortex-R52).
- *
- * M profile CPUs are rather different as they do not have a true MMU.
- * They have the following different MMU indexes:
- *  User
- *  Privileged
- *  User, execution priority negative (ie the MPU HFNMIENA bit may apply)
- *  Privileged, execution priority negative (ditto)
- * If the CPU supports the v8M Security Extension then there are also:
- *  Secure User
- *  Secure Privileged
- *  Secure User, execution priority negative
- *  Secure Privileged, execution priority negative
- *
- * The ARMMMUIdx and the mmu index value used by the core QEMU TLB code
- * are not quite the same -- different CPU types (most notably M profile
- * vs A/R profile) would like to use MMU indexes with different semantics,
- * but since we don't ever need to use all of those in a single CPU we
- * can avoid having to set NB_MMU_MODES to "total number of A profile MMU
- * modes + total number of M profile MMU modes". The lower bits of
- * ARMMMUIdx are the core TLB mmu index, and the higher bits are always
- * the same for any particular CPU.
- * Variables of type ARMMUIdx are always full values, and the core
- * index values are in variables of type 'int'.
- *
- * Our enumeration includes at the end some entries which are not "true"
- * mmu_idx values in that they don't have corresponding TLBs and are only
- * valid for doing slow path page table walks.
- *
- * The constant names here are patterned after the general style of the names
- * of the AT/ATS operations.
- * The values used are carefully arranged to make mmu_idx => EL lookup easy.
- * For M profile we arrange them to have a bit for priv, a bit for negpri
- * and a bit for secure.

+ *     handling via the TLB. The only way to do a stage 1 translation without
+ *     the immediate stage 2 translation is via the ATS or AT system insns,
+ *     which can be slow-pathed and always do a page table walk.
+ *     The only use of stage 2 translations is either as part of an s1+2
+ *     lookup or when loading the descriptors during a stage 1 page table walk,
+ *     and in both those cases we don't use the TLB.
+ *  4. we can also safely fold together the "32 bit EL3" and "64 bit EL3"
+ *     translation regimes, because they map reasonably well to each other
+ *     and they can't both be active at the same time.
+ *  5. we want to be able to use the TLB for accesses done as part of a
+ *     stage1 page table walk, rather than having to walk the stage2 page
+ *     table over and over.
+ *  6. we need separate EL1/EL2 mmu_idx for handling the Privileged Access
+ *     Never (PAN) bit within PSTATE.
+ *  7. we fold together most secure and non-secure regimes for A-profile,
+ *     because there are no banked system registers for aarch64, so the
+ *     process of switching between secure and non-secure is
+ *     already heavyweight.
+ *  8. we cannot fold together Stage 2 Secure and Stage 2 NonSecure,
+ *     because both are in use simultaneously for Secure EL2.
+ *
+ * This gives us the following list of cases:
+ *
+ * EL0 EL1&0 stage 1+2 (aka NS PL0 PL1&0 stage 1+2)
+ * EL1 EL1&0 stage 1+2 (aka NS PL1 PL1&0 stage 1+2)
+ * EL1 EL1&0 stage 1+2 +PAN (aka NS PL1 P1&0 stage 1+2 +PAN)
+ * EL0 EL2&0
+ * EL2 EL2&0
+ * EL2 EL2&0 +PAN
+ * EL2 (aka NS PL2)
+ * EL3 (aka AArch32 S PL1 PL1&0)
+ * AArch32 S PL0 PL1&0 (we call this EL30_0)
+ * AArch32 S PL1 PL1&0 +PAN (we call this EL30_3_PAN)
+ * Stage2 Secure
+ * Stage2 NonSecure
+ * plus one TLB per Physical address space: S, NS, Realm, Root
+ *
+ * for a total of 16 different mmu_idx.
+ *
+ * R profile CPUs have an MPU, but can use the same set of MMU indexes
+ * as A profile. They only need to distinguish EL0 and EL1 (and
+ * EL2 for cores like the Cortex-R52).
+ *
+ * M profile CPUs are rather different as they do not have a true MMU.
+ * They have the following different MMU indexes:
+ *  User
+ *  Privileged
+ *  User, execution priority negative (ie the MPU HFNMIENA bit may apply)
+ *  Privileged, execution priority negative (ditto)
+ * If the CPU supports the v8M Security Extension then there are also:
+ *  Secure User
+ *  Secure Privileged
+ *  Secure User, execution priority negative
+ *  Secure Privileged, execution priority negative
+ *
+ * The ARMMMUIdx and the mmu index value used by the core QEMU TLB code
+ * are not quite the same -- different CPU types (most notably M profile
+ * vs A/R profile) would like to use MMU indexes with different semantics,
+ * but since we don't ever need to use all of those in a single CPU we
+ * can avoid having to set NB_MMU_MODES to "total number of A profile MMU
+ * modes + total number of M profile MMU modes". The lower bits of
+ * ARMMMUIdx are the core TLB mmu index, and the higher bits are always
+ * the same for any particular CPU.
+ * Variables of type ARMMUIdx are always full values, and the core
+ * index values are in variables of type 'int'.
+ *
+ * Our enumeration includes at the end some entries which are not "true"
+ * mmu_idx values in that they don't have corresponding TLBs and are only
+ * valid for doing slow path page table walks.
+ *
+ * The constant names here are patterned after the general style of the names
+ * of the AT/ATS operations.
+ * The values used are carefully arranged to make mmu_idx => EL lookup easy.
+ * For M profile we arrange them to have a bit for priv, a bit for negpri
+ * and a bit for secure.
