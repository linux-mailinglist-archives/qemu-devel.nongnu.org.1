Hm, yes and no. Primarily I'm trying to find out what our options are as
the next step. So in this case, why did we make the change back then,
and can the same problem it was supposed to solve still be solved in a
different way? If so, then yes, we can essentially revert it. But I'm
not proposing that we skip the step of understanding and just go ahead,
change the code and then wait and see what breaks.

Maybe Vladimir can remember, that would be the easiest. Otherwise, maybe
some mailing list archeology can help. If none of these lead to
anything, we'd still have to thoroughly think through the consequences
for all callers before we can conclude that changing things this way is
safe.

Ok, that's a good start at least. And I see that before commit bcc8584,
bdrv_cor_filter_drop() didn't have this detaching behaviour either, it
used plain bdrv_replace_node(). So it might actually have been
unintentional here.

The other user is bdrv_cbw_drop(), and that one did have an explicit
bdrv_set_backing_hd(bs, NULL, &error_abort); before switching to
bdrv_drop_filter() in commit b75d64b. Not sure if it was right before,
but at least it always behaved like this, and we would change it now
rather than reverting to an older state.

Let's see if others have something to say on this.

Kevin
