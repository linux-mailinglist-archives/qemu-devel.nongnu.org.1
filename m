Seems like a sane default is already there. (And on most other boards.)

I also note that 90% of the above qemu invocation is the same for all 
targets. My build system's entire configuration for the m68k 
architecture is just:

There are some targets I have to poke harder, armv5l and armv4tl have
"qemu-system-arm -M versatilepb -net nic,model=rtl8139 -net user" for 
some reason... Huh, apparently I've been doing that since 2007?

https://github.com/landley/aboriginal/commit/5a51e551568a

Why did I do that... https://landley.net/notes-2007.html#04-07-2007 says 
"switch to using the rtl8139 driver because PIO doesn't work on
the qemu-system-arm PCI controller yet so I need something with mmio." 
Maybe that's fixed by now and I can go back to the default network card 
there? Hmmm, hw/arm/versatilepb.c says the default is smc91c111, the 
kernel driver for that is CONFIG_SMC91X... which needs GPIOLIB for some 
reason (why is that a depends not a selects?) And yes, the board's 
default network card works if I flip on the right driver and remove the 
--micromanagement.

Ok, fixed: https://github.com/landley/toybox/commit/65887c2f3cd8

But the point was it _can_ do that. Just seldom needs to. I was asking 
for a "that" prefix which let me use -hda on or1k (and still worked when 
I didn't supply one). I don't mind supplementing or overriding an 
unworkable default in the wrapper script, I've done it before. But what 
I was asking for was something to make -hda work when $@ expanded to it.

A raw block device can be loopback mounted on the host and mounted 
within qemu in the same way. (Qemu doesn't even mind if they're sparse, 
although loopback still did last I checked.)

The block device isn't even always a filesystem, sometimes it's a 
tarball. And when it is a filesystem, half the time it's squashfs. Why 
wrap it in a ubifs-style block remapping layer? Extra step, more tools, 
can't look at the data in hexedit (which comes up)... It may be nice to 
have a more complicated option, but "raw image" is the generic version.

Where "you don't" means "the board doesn't"? So the user of the board 
has to manually tell the board emulation what bus type it has available? 
(And guess right, because I can't add arbitrary types, the board will 
only ACCEPT certain ones...)

With hda I'm saying "here's the filename for your block device", and I'm 
usually externally supplying it to an existing board setup. When 
comparing the m68k behavior with the arm behavior of the same piece of 
software, I don't need to tell each system how to be itself. (It already 
knows.)

With your suggested API, specifying the filename as its own argument 
separate from the rest doesn't seem to have occurred to the designers.

If I don't provide an -hda then there isn't one. Cleanly drops out. If I 
specify -device without a filename, qemu tends to get upset and refuse 
to start.

You jumped into the thread to encouraging a move from -hda to -drive. In 
what way is -drive the superior option from a user perspective?

By "shouldn't need to micro manage the bus details", are you saying I 
can link the device to the backend without ever having manually 
specified the bus type on the command line?

Inside the VM, my init script does something like:

   [ -e /dev/?da ] && mount /dev/?da /mnt
   [ -x /mnt/init ] && exec /mnt/init

So it doesn't care if it's sda or vda and "just works" as long as the 
device shows up in /dev. And it just works if it's _not_ there either. 
(And used to work with /dev/hda before they made everything pretend to 
be scsi.)

To trigger it, I go "./run-qemu.sh -hda filename.img" because my run 
script has "$@" in the qemu command line, so I don't need to know how it 
will be used. (This isn't the ONLY thing they can add, another common 
thing is to set up port forwarding so a server in the emulator can 
appear on a host loopback port.) It's a generic tool like a hammer. It 
works the same whether ./run-qemu.sh is in the m68k directory, sh4eb, 
powerpc, etc.

Required when -hda doesn't work.

> -drive attempts to do both in one command line option

If I can -drive setup,setup,setup and then -hda filename.img (or not) 
later, then the details can get hidden in run-qemu.sh, which is what I 
was asking how to do earlier in this thread.

Or does -drive still require I know what filename to attach, and whether 
or not to do it? So if I wanted to support -hda command.sqf -hdb 
workspace.ext3 -hdc toolchain.iso that got intercepted and turned into
-drive by a shell script I would need... I dunno, some sort of loop?

Do you want my wrapper script to include a regex to notice one of its 
arguments was "-hda", find the argument after that and convert it into a 
-drive line, with error handling for "there wasn't another argument" or 
, and = in the filename? Plus it needs to know -hdb and -hdc and -hdd as 
well to keep parity with what was previously there...

Or do you want the users to have to externally specify the -drive line 
to the script, with target-specific bus type they didn't need to know 
before in order to attach a disk to a VM?

Which of these is the improvement that makes a move from -hda to -drive 
better for the user?

I have one already. The qemu devs deprecated it for some reason, and 
made it spit warnings and break fdisk when using "raw" images. (If you 
can wipe everything _except_ the first few blocks, what exactly have you 
improved? Never understood that part...)

The test I ran upthread said that aarch64, armv7l, riscv32, riscv64, and 
s390x were all using /dev/vda for -hda.

And armv4l, armv5l, i486, i686, m68k, mips, mips64, mipsel, powerpc, 
powerpc64, powerpc64le, sh4, sh4eb, and x86_64 weren't.

And the caller didn't need to know the difference.

Which is why my question upthread was if there was a way to use the 
micromanaging --longopts to tell qemu what plumbing -hda (and -hdb, etc) 
should attach to, without actually requiring there to _be_ one.

The answer seems to be "no, it needs a patch and rebuild".

If I have to agglutinate a supplied filename into a -drive 
thing,thing,thing list, how do you suggest I do that without #!/bin/bash 
having to be present because I wrote shell plumbing to make elaborate 
command line option parsing decisions that were never tested on "fish" 
or "zsh" or "dash" or busybox ash or...

Keep in mind the current shell plumbing is literally "$@" from posix.

Do you plan to replace "-m 256" with a longopt that requires you to 
specify the physical address range of the new memory using multiple 
name=value comma separated arguments?

Or is "-m 256" a useful control knob indicating a thing a user wants to 
have happen without needing to know all the board-specific 
implementation details to invoke it?

I asked why append doesn't 8 years ago:

https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2017-05/msg03127.html

I'm not sure how your response relates to "-hda complains about raw 
images". The commit in question that broke it (38f3ef574b48) preserved 
the probe for image types, instead of having -hda just default to "raw" 
always, and requiring the --longopt version to specify the types. That's 
the part I never understood, THAT seemed a really weird decision. "The 
qcow image format is insecure, because qcow can always #include 
arbitrary external files so if you run qemu as root it can read 
/etc/shadow which is apparently a thing people do". There is indeed a 
problem, but it's not raw?

For that matter, why not do what qemu did for:

-m [size=]megs[,slots=n,maxmem=size]

You _can_ have a short option do a sane thing by default but add 
_optional_ compostable csv nonsense to it, where "in order to use an 
image file with an = or , in it you need -hda name=thing,thing and name= 
will always eat the rest of its argument", possibly with an informative 
error message when -hda file,name or -hda file=name doesn't understand 
what it was given.

The UI decisions here struck me as very strange, and deprecating the way 
-hda has worked since 2005 seemed odd to me. (Possibly earlier but 
https://landley.net/notes-2005.html#02-12-2005 is when I first got an 
-hda of a partitioned disk image with LILO installed on it to boot under 
qemu. That was before even aboriginal linux, that was 
https://landley.net/aboriginal/old/ and most of the progress reports 
about _that_ were on livejournal. I switched from User Mode Linux _to_ 
qemu.)
