Yep, this apparent broad acceptance (or at least tolerance) for use of
Rust is a clear difference from any previous discussion about introducing
new languages in QEMU n the past.

Yeah, I think this last step is soo unlikely (or far away) that we could
reasonably just not include it at all. Perhaps any future grandchildren
will do this part for us ;-P

We should include plans about Rust at the top of the release notes too
for all forthcoming versions until we have it turned on permanently.

I feel like we're pretty close to wanting todo this regardless of
Rust support.

There's a topical blog from Google about their experiance with
Android that just hit LWN:

  https://security.googleblog.com/2024/09/eliminating-memory-safety-vulnerabilities-Android.html

"vulnerabilities decay exponentially. They have a half-life.
 ...
 the density of Android’s memory safety bugs decreased with
 the age of the code, primarily residing in recent changes.

  This leads to two important takeaways:

   * The problem is overwhelmingly with new code, necessitating a
     fundamental change in how we develop code.
  
   * Code matures and gets safer with time, exponentially, making
     the returns on investments like rewrites diminish over time
     as code gets older."

IOW, if we rush into conversion of existing code, we're likely to
harm QEMU's quality in the short-medium term.

We should thus encourage/prioritize use of Rust for *new* code, and
be more cautious / targetted about converting existing code, to
mitigate the risks inherant in any rewrites.

If we want arbitrary new devices to be able to be written in Rust,
we want to make sure we have the backends accessible to the Rust
frontend device, for developers to consume.

To be able to design & validate any Rust abstractions for backends,
we need to have at least 1 Rust device consuming each different
backend type eg, chardev, netdev, blockdev, tpm, rng, watchdog.
Similarly for other helper code like IO channels, crypto.

Probably need some kind of QAPI support sooner than we think, given how
widely it spreads.

Yep, communication is critical, if proposing to rewrite existing
functionality. Drowning maintainers in conversion patches without
warning is a guaranteed way to create friction between people.

On a long enough time frame, all exiting code can be considered
technical debt. Given the relatively sparse Rust experiance
across our community, we're guaranteed to make more design
mistakes in the first few years. Mitigating this is important,
but at the same time, we should also accept we're not going
to get everything perfect.

One thing our community is very good at is obsessing about
perfection of patch series. I can forsee us doing that to an
even greater extent with any Rust conversions of code. If we
are not careful we could really harm  our overall productivity
by spending too much time striving for a perfect Rust abstraction
first time out, even though many of us would still be relative
newcomers to Rust, such that we don't know what we don't know.

IOW, we need to be pragmatic about accepting some level of
technical debt at times. Especially if there are cases where
our Rust design is held back by existing C code, we might be
better off temporarily accepting sub-optimal Rust, to avoid
immediately refactoring piles of C code, and tackle the problems
later.

In terms of our distro support matrix, I think we should follow the
same practice as Python. ie we only check that the distro provides
the required toolchain / base language, and never check the crates.
IMHO vendoring is really the only viable option for distros with
non-trivial applications, as IME the de-vendoring crates waaaaay
too much busy-work in the distro.
