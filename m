No need to be sorry!  Kick-starting discussion with limited effort is
better than a big effort going into a direction that turns out to be
unwanted once we discuss it.

Instead of just rephrasing Returns descriptions, I'd like us to consider
both Returns and intro.  See below for why.

Stopping here, because I believe this is already enough to make a useful
observation.

There's overlap between query-FOO's intro and Returns.  The intro
describes the command's purpose, and the purpose of a query-FOO is to
return certain information.  Returns describes the value returned.  Both
talk about the same thing, namely the value returned.

Why two prose descriptions of the value returned?  Wouldn't one be
better?

Let's try.  We need to choose where to put it, intro or Returns.

When Returns comes right after intro, putting it into Returns can work
fine, because the command's purpose still comes first.  For instance:

   ##
   # @query-block:
   #
   # Return information about all virtual block devices.  Filter nodes
   # that were created implicitly are skipped over.

renders like

    Command query-block (Since: 0.14)

       Return information about all virtual block devices. Filter nodes
       that were created implicitly are skipped over.

       Return:
          ["BlockInfo"]

and

   ##
   # @query-block:
   #
   # Returns: Information about all virtual block devices.
   #     Filter nodes that were created implicitly are skipped over.

renders like

    Command query-block (Since: 0.14)

       Return:
          ["BlockInfo"] -- Information about all virtual block
          devices. Filter nodes that were created implicitly are skipped
          over.

Both work.

But when there's something in between, intro is preferable.  For
instance:

   ##
   # @query-blockstats:
   #
   # Return statistics for all virtual block devices.
   #
   # @query-nodes: If true, the command will query all the block nodes
   #     that have a node name, in a list which will include "parent"
   #     information, but not "backing".  If false or omitted, the
   #     behavior is as before - query all the device backends,
   #     recursively including their "parent" and "backing".  Filter
   #     nodes that were created implicitly are skipped over in this
   #     mode.  (Since 2.3)

renders like

    Command query-blockstats (Since: 0.14)

       Return statistics for all virtual block devices.

       Arguments:
          * **query-nodes** ("boolean", *optional*) -- If true, the
            command will query all the block nodes that have a node name,
            in a list which will include "parent" information, but not
            "backing".  If false or omitted, the behavior is as before -
            query all the device backends, recursively including their
            "parent" and "backing".  Filter nodes that were created
            implicitly are skipped over in this mode.  (Since 2.3)

       Return:
          ["BlockStats"]

while

   ##
   # @query-blockstats:
   #
   # @query-nodes: If true, the command will query all the block nodes
   #     that have a node name, in a list which will include "parent"

   #     recursively including their "parent" and "backing".  Filter
   #     nodes that were created implicitly are skipped over in this
   #     mode.  (Since 2.3)
   #
   # Returns: Statistics for all virtual block devices

renders like

    Command query-blockstats (Since: 0.14)

       Arguments:
          * **query-nodes** ("boolean", *optional*) -- If true, the
            command will query all the block nodes that have a node name,
            in a list which will include "parent" information, but not
            "backing".  If false or omitted, the behavior is as before -
            query all the device backends, recursively including their
            "parent" and "backing".  Filter nodes that were created
            implicitly are skipped over in this mode.  (Since 2.3)

       Return:
          ["BlockStats"] -- Statistics for all virtual block devices

I much prefer the former, because it puts the command's purpose where it
belongs: first.

Perhaps we should simply use the intro always.

Thoughts?
