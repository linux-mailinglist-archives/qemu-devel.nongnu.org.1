Isn't the whole paragraph meant to say that exceptions don't make any of
earlier mentioned requirements go away? So I don't think it would be
redundant in this context, even though of course it would repeat the
requirement just to tell more specifically what it's referring to.

If you don't want to say "copyright or license status" here, referring
to "DCO requirements" would have the same effect (because we do have
the explanation you quoted).
