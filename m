I know, but if we add out-of-tree things, there's some fundamental
things that change - we need to load that dependency somewhere,
somewhen.

I definitely could, and I think it would be rather convenient; I only
have some minor concerns about it:

- We don't promise tests on all platforms that we promise builds on.
We have definitely broken this in the past. It might work currently,
but it's a line I want to be aware we are crossing. It may necessitate
python3-wheel and python3-setuptools just to build in this case.
That's probably not an issue on workstations, but it's more bricks on
the wall that are actually not truly needed until you run tests (or
prepare to run tests).

- Configure will get slower by default. I can install the core test
deps by default if people don't mind the additional delay time. It
might be something like 2-4 seconds, depending. If you don't care, I
don't.

- Things like functional tests are still going to require some kind of
environment prep for all the extra stuff they require, I don't think
it's reasonable to preload all of that stuff at configure time, and we
never have. "make check-functional" is sufficient to pull those deps
in, but if there are ways to engage the functional tests manually that
people are using, I think another preparation step is unavoidable
there.

So, in addition to the "pyrun" wrapper I mailed in a separate reply
(which I think is a good idea anyway, regardless of what direction we
go here), I see two main paths that address your issues in differing
amounts:

(1) make configure prepare the test deps *by default*, adding a flag
like --without-test-deps to disable it, or

(2) Continue not prepping the test deps, but allow --with-test-deps to
pre-load them.

More or less the same solution, just with different defaults. I'm
fairly ambivalent, my only personal "habit" here is "I am really
reluctant to touch configure unless there is a strong consensus around
it because I dislike having to make arguments at that level."
