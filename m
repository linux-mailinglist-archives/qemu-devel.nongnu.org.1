Do you mean merging platform dumps should be done with another command? 
I think we will want to know the QOM tree is in use when implementing 
-merge-platform. For example, you cannot define a "platform" when e.g., 
you don't know what netdev backend (e.g., user, vhost-net, vhost-vdpa) 
is connected to virtio-net devices. Of course we can include those 
information in dumps, but we don't do so for VMState.

Perhaps it may be named no-cross-migrate or something. There are lots of 
details we need to figure out.

There is certainly downside and upside to add a migration blocker and I 
don't have a strong opinion here.
