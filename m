Mirror case differs from usage in qcow2 exactly by the fact that we call it only once.

Or I mean, could we just use different block-status modes in qcow2 and mirror, when call bdrv_co_is_zero_fast(), and don't handle offset==0 specially in file-posix?

Thanks for explanation! Yes I think making such specific checks about first sector in some kind of generic bdrv_is_all_zeroes() would be cleaner.
