Good idea. I will need to do something about the -global options because
they also set the defaults for the various options. But we should be
able to decouple setting defaults from -global. Or I could just apply
-global again on top of what came in '*config'.

Oops, I misread the strcmp in vl.c. I mean -incoming uri is the one
that'll need a huge cmdline.

But if we follow your suggestion above we could just tie -incoming URI
to the existing commands and make the new format require defer.
