RC = root complex?

Physical ARM hardware?

Assuming the virtual devices and buses we're discussing model physical
devices and buses:

* What are the physical devices of interest?

* How are they wired together?  Which of the wires are buses, in
  particular PCI buses?

Device property "bus" is strictly for specifying into which the bus the
device is to be plugged.  The device's type must match the bus: only a
PCI device can plug into a PCI bus, and so forth.

A PCI device has a PCI address (dev.fn) on the bus it's plugged into.
If that's not the case for a physical smmuv3, we should not make the
virtual smmuv3 a PCI device.

Is there any prior art in QEMU, or is this the first device of this
kind?
