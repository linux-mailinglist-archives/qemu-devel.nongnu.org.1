Yes, and I suggest a rename or introduce a new helper, per previous reply.

I didn't follow, sorry - do you mean this patch is correct on dropping the
mapped-ram check? I don't yet understand how it can work if without.

I meant tls channels should have these magics too.  Do you mean they're
not?

Yes.

No I don't think so.

Flushing sending side makes sure send buffer is empty.  It doesn't
guarantee recv buffer is empty on the other side.

With or without a reproducer, we need to at least justify it in theory.  If
it doesn't even work in theory, it's a problem.

Yes, probably before multifd_recv_state->ops->recv().
