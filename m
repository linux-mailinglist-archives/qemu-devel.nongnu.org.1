We cannot, but we have designed the attack (see below) to improve the
possibility.

Admittedly the way we accomplish a VM escape is a bit arcane.

We require device passthrough because it pins the VM's memory down and
converts them to MIGRATE_UNMOVABLE. Hotplugged memory will also be
converted to MIGRATE_UNMOVABLE. That way when we give memory back to the
hypervisor, they stay UNMOVABLE. Otherwise we will have to convert the
pages to UNMOVABLE or exhaust ALL MIGRATE_MOVALE pages, both of which
cannot be easily accomplished.

Then we require vIOMMU because vIOMMU mappings, much like EPTEs, use
MIGRATE_UNMOVABLE pages as well. By spawning lots of meaningless vIOMMU
entries, we exhaust UNMOVABLE page blocks of lower orders (<9). Next
time KVM tries to allocate pages to store EPTEs, the kernel has to split
an order-9 page block, which is exactly the size of a 2MB sub-block.

 > Out of curiosity, are newer CPUs no longer affected?

When qemu pins down the VM's memory, it also establishes every possible
mapping to the VM's memory in the EPT.

To spawn new EPTEs, we exploit KVM's fix to the iTLB multihit bug.
Basically, we execute a bunch of no-op functions, and KVM will have to
split hugepages into 4KB pages. This process creates a large number of
EPTEs.

The iTLB multihit bug roughly speaking is only present on non-Atom Intel
CPUs manufactured before 2020.

Could work in theory, but if the newly plugged sub-block does not
contain vulnerable pages, there is no promise that the attacker would
get a sub-block containing a different set of pages next time.

It also depends heavily on the configuration of the virtio-mem device.
If there is not much non-virtio-mem memory for the VM, the attacker
could easily run out of memory.
