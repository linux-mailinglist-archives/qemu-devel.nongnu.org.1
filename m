Machine types are a special case because we've explicitly designed &
documented them to have this behaviour of changing on every release,
long before we even had the deprecation policy, while also providing
the versioned machines for back compat. More recently we documented
a formal 6 year lifecycle for version machines.


When it comes to defaults in general, and interaction with the
deprecation policy, IMHO, we need to consider the goal of the
policy.

Essentially we're trying to make it possible for QEMU to drop
legacy technical debt, while avoiding repeated surprises on
users and mgmt apps. The compromise was to give users a min
two releases prior warning of the change coming along in the
future to give them time to adapt.

We still have the tension there between the two parties.

As maintainers of QEMU we'd like scope of that policy to be as
narrow as possible, while as a user of QEMU I'd like the scope
to be broad enough to cover anything that might break the way
I currently consume QEMU.

IOW, I think users would consider that policy to apply to defaults
in general, modulo exceptions like the non-versioned machine types
/ aliases which have been explicitly designed to change.

With our mix of versioned and non-versioned machine types things are
somewhat fuzzier than that.

If the default is related to a piece of virtual hardware that is
*only* capable of be used by a non-versioned machine type, then
we have generally been happy to change it without notice.

For virtual hardware covered bya versioned machine type, then we
change it, but add the back compat.

IOW, anything related to virtual hardware is pretty loose with
defaults and hasn't gone through the deprecation process.


The defaults for stuff that is backend related, however, is much
more in scope of the deprecation policy IMHO.

NB not really a change in defaults. Traditionally, by default, we would
auto-generate Diffie-Hellman parameters at startup by calling a special
GNUTLS API. GNUTLS now auto-generates Diffie-Hellman parameters without
any special API being required. Its approach to generating has changed
to be RFC compliant. So we removed our code to manually auto-generate
DH parameters.

Both before & after, users could optionally override the generated
defaults with an external dh-params.pem file they created themselves.

Since GNUTLS is now RFC compliant for its auto-generated parameters,
there is no longer a compelling reason to allow the external override
so we're deprecating it.

I expect almost no one will be using the external dh-params.pem file.
Even once we remove it nothing breaks - existing deployments continue
working, just silently switching to the RFC compliant DH params, which
should not have any observable behavioural change for an admin.

TL:DR: the commit d58f9b20c71 is removing an opt-in feature, not a
default.



With regards,
Daniel
