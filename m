Hi Mostafa,

First, my apologies for the long delay in getting back to you. I was 
away on paternity leave for the last few weeks.

Thank you for the detailed follow-up, your advice is very helpful for 
simplifying the series.

I would like to confirm my understanding of the implementation. Does 
this mean that for the current RFC, we should set S_IDR1.SEL2=0, which 
implies that all Stage-2 translations will begin with a Non-secure IPA? 
And the final output PA space will then almost always be Non-secure PA, 
with the sole exception being when S2SW, S2SA, S2NSW, and S2NSA are ALL 
ZERO.


However, since these fields are RES0 when S_IDR1.SEL2=0, it seems we can 
conclude that for this version, the output will definitively be a 
Non-secure PA. I believe this is what you meant by your advice to "rely 
on NS stage-2". I would be grateful if you could let me know whether 
this interpretation is on the right track.

I have almost completed the refactoring based on this new structure, and 
I will send out the v2 patch series in the next few days for review.

Thanks again for your invaluable guidance.

Best regards,
