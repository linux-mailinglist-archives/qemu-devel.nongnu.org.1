sorry I missed this question. yes I think it is sensible to expose that
option to libvirt. There is no good default value to be set at qemu
level so to me it really depends on the upper stack to choose the
correct value (depending on the sensitiveness of the data that justified
the kernel uapi).

Marc said in a his cover letter
"
The filter state is global to the guest, despite the PMU being per CPU.
I'm not sure whether it would be worth it making it CPU-private."

I guess this is because Marc wanted to reuse the
KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3_CTRL group and just added a new attribute on top of
existing
KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3_IRQ, KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3_INIT
