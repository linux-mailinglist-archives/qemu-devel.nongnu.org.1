I don't think adding a delay here would be helpful. The point of
multipath isn't that you wait until a bad path comes back, but that you
just switch to a different path until it is restored.

Ideally, calling DM_MPATH_PROBE_PATHS would just remove all the bad
paths instantaneously and we would either be able to send the request
using one of the remaining good paths, or know that we have to fail. In
practice, the ioctl will probably have to wait for a timeout, so you get
a delay anyway.

What could potentially be useful is a new error policy [rw]error=3Dretry
with a configurable delay. This wouldn't be in file-posix, but in the
devices after file-posix came to the conclusion that there is currently
no usable path. On the other hand, retrying indefinitely is probably not
what you want either, so that could quickly become rather complex.
