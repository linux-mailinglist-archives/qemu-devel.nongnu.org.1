I think to use a hashtable to handle this has an important drawback:
it hurts performance on the devices that are using right in-order
because of hash calculus, to benefit devices that are using it badly
by using descriptors out of order. We should use data structs that are
as free as possible for the first, and we don't care to worse the
experience of the devices that enable in_order and they shouldn't.

So I suggest reusing vq->used_elems array vq. At each used descriptor
written in the used ring, you know the next head is elem->index +
elem->ndescs, so you can check if that element has been filled or not.
If used, it needs to be flushed too. If not used, just return.

Of course virtqueue_flush also needs to take this into account.

What do you think, does it make sense to you?

Thanks!
