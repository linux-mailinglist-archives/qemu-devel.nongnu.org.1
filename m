So, instead of

    if ref is fully qualified:
        try to look up ref
    else
        proceed to 2.

you do

    look up ref
    if found:
        ref must be fully qualified
    else
        proceed to 2.

Since "proceed to 2. won't do anything useful when ref is fully
qualified", the two should produce the same result.

I think we're describing the same behavior with different words

Behavior:

    try to fill the gaps from context
    if all filled:
        look up
        if found:
            done

When you say "tried #2 and failed", you're referring to the entire
thing.

When I say "skipped 2.", I'm referring to the lookup.

Alright, here's how it works.

A QAPI schema consists of the main schema file and optionally included
files.

Each file's definitions go into a module named like the file.  The
builtin definitions go into a special module './builtin'.

A definition is *always* in a module.  Even when the schema is
monolithic, i.e. includes nothing.

Why do you need to support definitions directly in the namespace?
