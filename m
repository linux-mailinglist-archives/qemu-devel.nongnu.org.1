I think I caused some confusion here. I wrote migrate_params_override()
last thing on a friday and forgot it did the right thing from the
beginning:

    migrate_params_apply(&s->defaults);
    qmp_migrate_set_parameters(new, errp);

This s->defaults is poorly named and is actualy already the merge of
defaults + globals, because qdev does it for us. migrate_params_apply()
will then copy that to s->parameters and qmp_migrate_set_parameters()
will apply the 'new' params from 'config' on top s->parameters. An
example:

Setting multifd-channels (default 2) using various methods and querying
both QMP and HMP:

a) global overrides default:

 $ ./qemu-system-x86_64 -global migration.multifd-channels=4 ...
 => QMP: "multifd-channels": 4, HMP: multifd-channels: 4

b) migrate-set-parameter overrides global:

 { 'execute': 'migrate-set-parameters', 'arguments': { 'multifd-channels': 8 } }
 => QMP: "multifd-channels": 8, HMP: multifd-channels: 8

c) config not touching the parameter, value is reset to global:

 { 'execute': 'migrate', 'arguments': { ..., 'config': { 'multifd': true } } }
 => QMP: "multifd-channels": 4, HMP: multifd-channels: 4

d) config overrides all:

 { 'execute': 'migrate', 'arguments': { ..., 'config': {'multifd-channels': 16 } } }
 => QMP: "multifd-channels": 16, HMP: multifd-channels: 16

Without global:

e) default is set initially

 $ ./qemu-system-x86_64 ...
 => QMP: "multifd-channels": 2, HMP: multifd-channels: 2

f) migrate-set-parameter overrides default:

 { 'execute': 'migrate-set-parameters', 'arguments': { 'multifd-channels': 8 } }
 => QMP: "multifd-channels": 8, HMP: multifd-channels: 8

g) config not touching the parameter, value is reset to default:

 { 'execute': 'migrate', 'arguments': { ..., 'config': { 'multifd': true } } }
 => "multifd-channels": 2, HMP: multifd-channels: 2

h) config overrides all:

 { 'execute': 'migrate', 'arguments': { ..., 'config': {'multifd-channels': 16 } } }
 => QMP: "multifd-channels": 16, HMP: multifd-channels: 16

I'll update the variable names and code comments to be more
precise. Sorry for the noise.
