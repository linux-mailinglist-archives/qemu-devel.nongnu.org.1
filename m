Let me add Niall to this thread.

I agree this is useful at least in the current state of things, and
possibly in the future for QEMUs built without support for new gdb
magic.

I don't think this is a question of preferring one or the other! Your
simple change works today with existing QEMU builds and has fewer
requirements, but it's also more limited in functionality.

The gdb changes look really nice at the first sight, debugging
coroutines as if they were threads is exactly what you want in most
cases. So I'd love to see this. Of course, someone would have to first
understand what needs to be done in detail and then implement the QEMU
side of it once the gdb side is merged.
