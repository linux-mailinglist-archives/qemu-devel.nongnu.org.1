Much technical detail here that won't make sense to the reader until
further down, but next to nothing on what the thing actually
accomplishes.  Makes the commit message unnecessarily hard to
understand.  But please read on.

Any additional requirements over traditional migration?

There, "same arguments" is sufficient, but not necessary.  For instance,
changing certain backends is quite possible.

Two -incoming options to define two migration channels, the traditional
one of MigrationChannelType "main", and an another one of
MigrationChannelType "cpr"?

I'd lead with a brief explanation of the feature and its benefits.
Could steam from the cover letter like this:

  New migration mode cpr-transfer mode enables transferring a guest to a
  new QEMU instance on the same host with minimal guest pause time, by
  preserving guest RAM in place, albeit with new virtual addresses in
  new QEMU, and by preserving device file descriptors.

Then talk about required special setup.  I see aux-ram-share=on.
Anything else?  Any differences between source and destination QEMU
there?

Then talk about the two channels.  First what they do, second how to
create their destination end with -incoming, third how to create their
source end with "migrate".

Finally mention whatever technical detail you believe needs mentioning
here.

Two of them?

The commit message also mentions file descriptors are migrared over.
Worth mentioning here, too?

This is vague.  Would anything but a UNIX domain socket work?

Applies to both source and destination end?

Ugh!  Remind me, why is that the case?

What happens when the conditions aren't met?  migrate command fails
with a useful error message?

Which of the two channels are you discussing?

I'm confused.  Not even qmp_capabilities?  Why?
