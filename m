I don't think limiting ourselves to the set of crates in the distro is
feasible. It's not the way the language works, for example I tried
checking if the "cstr" crate exists and I didn't find it in Debian.

We can define a known-good set of versions:
* either via Cargo.lock (i.e. recording the versions and downloading
them) or by including sources in the tree
* at any time in qemu.git, at branching time (three times a year), or
on every release

(That's six possibilities overall).

Yes, and --without-download may be changed to the "--frozen" flag of cargo.

Here are the stopping points that I found over the last couple weeks:

1.56.0: 2021 edition
1.59.0: const CStr::from_bytes_with_nul_unchecked (needed by cstr
crate, see below)
1.64.0: std::ffi::c_char
1.65.0: Generic Associated Types
1.74.0: Clippy can be configured in Cargo.toml
1.77.0: C string literals, offset_of!

I think 1.59.0 is pretty much the lower bound. Not having offset_of!
will be a bit painful, but it can be worked around (and pretty much
has to be, because 1.77.0 is really new).

As far as I understand, Debian bullseye has 1.63.0 these days and it's
the oldest platform we have.
