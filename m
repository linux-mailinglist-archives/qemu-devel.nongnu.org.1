Hi Mark,

"recorded section therefore seems to be incorrect".
do you observe a crash, or on assert failing at execution?

I don't know in details the code you mention, but after investigating 
and fixing https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/3040, I can 
share a few things.

Overall, what you describe looks like a race condition exposing a 
lifetime issue, especially when saying "we 'loose' the address space 
that has been returned by the translate function".
A value was not updated as expected and is out of sync, or was freed too 
early. Memory regions lifetime is something definitely tricky in QEMU, 
and when you mix that with RCU, things can become very obscure in 
multithreaded scenarios.

In the bug above, the solution was to stop duplicating this information, 
and get it from the same source. The overhead to read such atomic data 
is quite small, thanks to use of RCU.
At KVM Forum, Paolo told me he introduced this copy precisely to avoid 
issues, but the opposite happened in reality, which we both found was 
quite funny.

Additional questions:
- At which time of execution does it happen? Is it during pci devices 
initialization, or when remapping specific memory sections?
- Is the bug deterministic or random? If random, does increasing the 
number of pci devices attached increase the probably to meet it?

Additional tools:
- If you observe a crash, build with asan. If you get a use-after-free 
error, it's probably an issue with RCU cleaning up things before you 
expect. This is what I had in the bug mentioned above.
- If your assert fail, I can recommend you capture execution through rr 
(https://github.com/rr-debugger/rr), using chaos mode rr record --chaos, 
which will randomize scheduling of threads. I don't know if you're 
familiar with it, but it allows you to debug your execution "backward".
Once you captured the faulty execution, you can reach the crash or 
faulty assert, then execute backward (reverse-continue) with a 
watchpoint set on the (correct) value that was updated meanwhile. This 
way, you'll find which sequence led to desynchronization, and then 
you'll have a good start to deduce what the root cause is.
- Spend some time making the crash/assert almost deterministic, it will 
save you time later, especially when implementing a possible fix and 
prove it works.

I hope it helps.

Regards,
Pierrick
