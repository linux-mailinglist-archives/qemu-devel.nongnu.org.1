For now, I think it's okay to let ACPI PCI hotplug stabilize (while not being the
default) for at least one release cycle. So I'm fine with keeping acpi-pcihp=off as
the default.

As I mentioned elsewhere, I don't consider native PCIe hotplug to be legacy.

We can make acpi-pcihp=on the default in a future release once it's been more
widely exercised.

I'll update the bios-tables-test.c test accordingly, then you can either put them
in the v3 (if you happen to send v3 next week) or add them to a v4.


Cheers,
Gustavo
