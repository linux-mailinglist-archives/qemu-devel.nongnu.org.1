When shutting down a guest that is currently in progress of being
migrated, there is a chance that QEMU might crash during bdrv_delete().
The backtrace looks like this:

 Thread 74 "mig/src/main" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

 [Switching to Thread 0x3f7de7fc8c0 (LWP 2161436)]

 Backtrace stopped: Cannot access memory at address 0x3f7de7f83e0

The problem is apparently that the migration thread is still active
(migration_shutdown() only asks it to stop the current migration, but
does not wait for it to finish), while the main thread continues to
bdrv_close_all() that will destroy all block drivers. So the two threads
are racing here for the destruction of the migration-related block drivers.

I was able to bisect the problem and the race has apparently been introduced
by commit c2a189976e211c9ff782 ("migration/block-active: Remove global active
flag"), so reverting it might be an option as well, but waiting for the
migration thread to finish before continuing with the further clean-ups
during shutdown seems less intrusive.

Note: I used the Claude AI assistant for analyzing the crash, and it
came up with the idea of waiting for the migration thread to finish
in migration_shutdown() before proceeding with the further clean-up,
but the patch itself has been 100% written by myself.

Fixes: c2a189976e ("migration/block-active: Remove global active flag")
