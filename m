I have realized that *the patch is indeed a fix*, not a workaround.

In fact, the argument to LUI and AUIPC in assembly *must* be a number
between [0x0, 0xfffff].
RISC-V Assembly Programmer's Manual : Load Upper Immediate's Immediate
<https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-asm-manual/blob/master/riscv-asm.md=
#load-upper-immediates-immediate>
Signed decimal numbers are programmed as their two's complement.

I checked: neither GCC nor LLVM will assemble

> lui x1, -4

The LLVM compiled models the arguments to LUI and AUIPC as UIMM (unsigned
immediate) or UIMM20 (20 bit unsigned immediate).

I should have checked this from the start. I jumped to the conclusion that
both formats (signed decimal, two's complement) for negative arguments
should be supported, and that I was encountering a bug.
I apologize to all for the unnecessary back-and-forth.

I don't yet see a reason why llvm and gcc could not support a signed number
in decimal format, perhaps requiring a pseudo-instruction.
This might be desirable, if only in support of assembly programming.
On the other hand, it is easy to make the conversion to a two's-complement
number.
