For 1), please try the e1000 driver from Intel (I remember it could be
downloaded from the Intel website).
For 2), it would be hard as it needs to be tested with a lot of
operating systems (or we can have Intel Engineers involved).

And I really suggest you shift to e1000e (or igb) if it is possible.

Thanks
