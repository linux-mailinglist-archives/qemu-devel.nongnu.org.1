If its frequently timing out, then we've got the timeouts
wrong, or we have some genuine bugs in there to be fixed.

The combos we don't run for iotests are a good source of
regressions too :-(

Migration-test *used* to take 15 minutes to run, but that was a
very long time ago. A run of it today is around 1m20.

That said, if you are building multiple system emulators, we
run the same test multiple times, and with the number of
targets we have, that will be painful.

That could be a good reason to split the migration-test into
two distinct programs. One program that runs for every target,
and one that is only run once, for some arbitrary "primary"
target ?  Or could we make use of glib's g_test_thorough
for this - a primary target runs with "SPEED=through" and
all other targets with normal settings. That would give us
a way to optimize any of the qtests to reduce redundant
testing where appropriate.


If we move alot of testing out into a migration unit test,
this also solves the redundancy problem.


With regards,
Daniel
