Right, but usually you have to wait only for a very short time until the
mutex is released again and CoMutexes are more expensive then.

You absolutely do need to use CoMutex when the coroutine can yield in
the critical section, but if it can't, the CoMutex is often worse.

Though as I said here...

...we should probably use a coroutine version of ioctl() instead of
the blocking one, and then you do need the CoMutex.

Can you send a separate fix for this, please? (Can be both in one
patch series, though.)

If it's for debugging, I think trace points are best.
