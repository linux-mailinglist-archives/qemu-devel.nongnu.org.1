The major challenge here might be that, in migration's use case we want to
do something after the last refcount is released.

IOW, I don't yet see an easy way to explicit do qdev_unrealize() (even if
migration object will use realize(), while it doesn't yet..), because there
can be more than one thread holding refcount of the object, and we don't
know where to invoke it, and we don't want to do the cleanup if the other
one still holds a refcount.

The only sane place now is in instance_finalize(), which is the only clean
place so far that is invoked after last refcount dropped.

Maybe I can also try do that with a "magic property" with its set/get, as
that's indeed the other hook (basically, object_property_del_all()) that is
only invoked after the final refcount is released.  However I think we
still need the singleton idea somehow..

Thanks,
