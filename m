Good idea!

Yes, this will reduce BQL context in lockless IO a lot. And I'll based
on your patch to extract HPETTimer from BqlRefCell.

Yes, compared with 2), I also this is the better choice, which looks
more common and could be an good example for other device.

Thank you!

The code attached looks good. Only a minor question below:

I didn't get the point why we need to migrate this "index" instead of
HPETTimer::index?

Anyway, if we continue to keep index in HPETTimerRegisters, we can make
it have usize type with a "#[migration_state(try_into(u8))]" property.

If we just HPETTimer::index for migration, I think it's possible to do
type convertion in handwritten ToMigrationStateShared.

Thanks,
Zhao
