I never realized that "1" and "1" mean different things in PCI
addresses !

IIUC, "1" decodes as slot 1, function 0, while integer 1  decodes as
slot 0, function 1 .  ie raw integer value is "slot << 3 | function"
IIUC from the code ?

This is both majorly surprising, and rather obscure - did we document
the integer value encoding semantics anywhere ?

AFAICT, they first arrived back in

  commit 768a9ebe188bd0a6172a9a4e64777d21fff7f014
  Author: Paolo Bonzini <pbonzini@redhat.com>
  Date:   Thu Feb 9 09:53:32 2012 +0100

    qdev: accept both strings and integers for PCI addresses
    
    Visitors allow a limited form of polymorphism.  Exploit it to support
    setting the non-legacy PCI address property both as a DD.F string
    and as an 8-bit integer.

    The 8-bit integer form is just too clumsy, it is unlikely that we will
    ever drop it.


I'm guessing that last sentence is a mistake - refering to the new
integer syntax as clumsy & unable to be dropped doesn't make sense.
I assume it was referring to the historical string syntax as the
clumsy part.

I think neither syntax really makes sense from a pure QAPI design
POV, as both are inventing a special way to encode 2 distinct
fields within one field which is a QAPI anti-pattern. The "right"
QAPI answer is to express them as 2 distinct fields at the QAPI
level.

Having two distinct ways to express the same concept is redundant.
Perhaps passable if one syntax was actually following QAPI best
practice, even better if one syntax were deprecated.


Is it worth thinking about going through the tedium of deprecating
both of them and replacing the syntax with a preferred QAPI design
pattern ?

If we don't want to replace the existing string format which is
widely used, then is the integer format compelling enough to keep
as an option, given it will easily surprise people who don't read
the non-existant docs about it ? ie deprecate integer syntax and
leave ony the string syntax ?

FWIW, the options for a QAPI design following best practice
design would be

1. "slot" and "function" properties at top level

 {
   "execute": "device_add",
   "arguments": {
     "driver": "virtio-blk-pci",
     "drive": "disk",
     "id": "virtio-disk0",
     "bus": "pci.1",
     "slot": 1,
     "function": 0,
   },
   "id": "__qmp#00002"
 }


2. two element array

 {
   "execute": "device_add",
   "arguments": {
     "driver": "virtio-blk-pci",
     "drive": "disk",
     "id": "virtio-disk0",
     "bus": "pci.1",
     "addr": [1, 0]
   },
   "id": "__qmp#00002"
 }


3. As 1 but with nested struct

 {
   "execute": "device_add",
   "arguments": {
     "driver": "virtio-blk-pci",
     "drive": "disk",
     "id": "virtio-disk0",
     "bus": "pci.1",
     "addr": {
       "slot": 1,
       "function": 0
     }
   },
   "id": "__qmp#00002"
 }

Daniel
