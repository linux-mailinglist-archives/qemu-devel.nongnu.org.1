NB, ...makes sense only when we have CONFIG_KVM **and** the QEMU
process was launched with '-accel kvm'.

It feels strange that we want our reported schema show a difference when
we launch "qemu-system-x86_64 -accel tcg" between two builds one with
and without CONFIG_KVM, when KVM is not in use ? 

Or to reverse the question, why does it matter if we report existence
of KvmPmuEventFormat unconditionally ?

Is the precision we have justifiable ?

When it comes to runtime configuration QMP is already imprecise.

eg set-cpu-topology on x390 is KVM only but still there
   when running with TCG

eg reporting query-hotpluggable-cpus on machine types that
   lack hotplug

eg reporting set-numa-node on arches/machines that lack NUMA

eg reporting query-balloon when no balloon device is present

eg reporting various xen- commands when either the target
   or machine type lack Xen support

eg reporting many cxl-* commands when either the target
   or machine type lacks CXL support.

IOW the use of TARGET_ conditionals are only addressing a very
narrow area of (im)precision, whose rationale is largely an
artifact of our historical separate binary / multiple builds
choice. The only real justification for continuing with this
is that we've always done it.

Creating a general runtime conditional mechanism in QAPI feels
like opening a pandora's box.

We'll have a mechanism but it will be impractical to use it fully
enough to be able to claim we are actually precise. The scope of
runtime choices/conditions is too huge.

It risks creating a mechanism that requires a never ending stream
of patches to address continually reported gaps. A potentially
significant maintainer burden.

By comparison the CONFIG_ conditionals in QAPI, both the scope
and semantics clear and it is a fairly tractable problem, although
even there we miss them eg lack of CONFIG_XEN conditions on xen
commands.
