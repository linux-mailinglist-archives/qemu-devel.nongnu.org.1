Inspired by the same-named type in Linux.  This type provides the compiler
with a correct view of what goes on with FFI types.  In addition, it
separates the glue code from the bindgen-generated code, allowing
traits such as Send, Sync or Zeroable to be specified independently
for C and Rust structs.

+//! ## Opaque wrappers
+//!
+//! The cell types from the previous section are useful at the boundaries
+//! of code that requires interior mutability.  When writing glue code that
+//! interacts directly with C structs, however, it is useful to operate
+//! at a lower level.
+//!
+//! C functions often violate Rust's fundamental assumptions about memory
+//! safety by modifying memory even if it is shared.  Furthermore, C structs
+//! often start their life uninitialized and may be populated lazily.
+//!
+//! For this reason, this module provides the [`Opaque<T>`] type to opt out
+//! of Rust's usual guarantees about the wrapped type. Access to the wrapped
+//! value is always through raw pointers, obtained via methods like
+//! [`as_mut_ptr()`](Opaque::as_mut_ptr) and [`as_ptr()`](Opaque::as_ptr). These
+//! pointers can then be passed to C functions or dereferenced; both actions
+//! require `unsafe` blocks, making it clear where safety guarantees must be
+//! manually verified. For example
+//!
+//! ```ignore
+//! unsafe {
+//!     let state = Opaque::<MyStruct>::uninit();
+//!     qemu_struct_init(state.as_mut_ptr());
+//! }
+//! ```
+//!
+//! [`Opaque<T>`] will usually be wrapped one level further, so that
+//! bridge methods can be added to the wrapper:
+//!
+//! ```ignore
+//! pub struct MyStruct(Opaque<bindings::MyStruct>);
+//!
+//! impl MyStruct {
+//!     fn new() -> Pin<Box<MyStruct>> {
+//!         let result = Box::pin(unsafe { Opaque::uninit() });
+//!         unsafe { qemu_struct_init(result.as_mut_ptr()) };
+//!         result
+//!     }
+//! }
+//! ```
+//!
+//! This pattern of wrapping bindgen-generated types in [`Opaque<T>`] provides
+//! several advantages:
+//!
+//! * The choice of traits to be implemented is not limited by the
+//!   bindgen-generated code.  For example, [`Drop`] can be added without
+//!   disabling [`Copy`] on the underlying bindgen type
+//!
+//! * [`Send`] and [`Sync`] implementations can be controlled by the wrapper
+//!   type rather than being automatically derived from the C struct's layout
+//!
+//! * Methods can be implemented in a separate crate from the bindgen-generated
+//!   bindings
+//!
+//! * [`Debug`](std::fmt::Debug) and [`Display`](std::fmt::Display)
+//!   implementations can be customized to be more readable than the raw C
+//!   struct representation
+//!
+//! The [`Opaque<T>`] type does not include BQL validation; it is possible to
+//! assert in the code that the right lock is taken, to use it together
+//! with a custom lock guard type, or to let C code take the lock, as
+//! appropriate.  It is also possible to use it with non-thread-safe
+//! types, since by default (unlike [`BqlCell`] and [`BqlRefCell`]
+//! it is neither `Sync` nor `Send`.
+//!
+//! While [`Opaque<T>`] is necessary for C interop, it should be used sparingly
+//! and only at FFI boundaries. For QEMU-specific types that need interior
+//! mutability, prefer [`BqlCell`] or [`BqlRefCell`].
