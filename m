I see no DKIM-Signature, and not DKIM DNS records with the
default selector.

We have no access to anything in the mailman service - we're just
using the nongnu.org service for QEMU, run by the GNU project.

I should have checked before, but I see there are other people
using @huawei.com email addresses that are posting to qemu-devel
successfully.

That seems to suggest that the huawei mail is able to work with
QEMU lists and nothing about SPF/DKIM/DMARC is a blocking problem

Unfortunately we have no insight into operation of the mailman service
as that's not run by QEMU.
