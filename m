Returning failure without setting an error is commonly wrong, and when
it's not, it's a bad interface.  However, I can't see how this function
could do that.  Can you enlighten me?

In my opinion, this function is just fine.  There are of course other
ways to skin this cat.

I readily concede:

(1) If func() lacks a written contract, passing on func2()'s value makes
the implied contract harder to see.

(2) If func() has a written contract, passing on func2()'s value makes
it harder to verify, and easier to break accidentally.

(3) When no caller needs to discriminate between different errors,
returning -1 or false results in a slightly simpler interface.

Still, has this plagued us in practice?

The only issue in this area that has plagued me enough to remember is
functions returning both -1 and negative errno.  Which works fine as
long as callers only check for negative, but is in my opinion
intolerably sloppy.  Whether the function takes an errp or not doesn't
matter.

I don't think a blanket prohibition of returning negative errno makes
sense.  Discouraging it maybe, but given how rarely it's done, I doubt
it's worth the bother.

Do feel free to send patches to simplify interfaces regardless.
