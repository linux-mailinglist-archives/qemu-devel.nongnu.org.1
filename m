I'm always fuzzy on that distinction myself.  But reading the docs helps...

...[1] sounds more appropriate.  Adding the marker is more of a
promise that "I've audited that this function does not block and is
therefore safe for a function in coroutine context to use", but
sometimes additionally implies "this function assumes a coroutine is
present; if you are not in a coroutine, things might break".  But with
a bit of thought, it is obvious that a coroutine can call functions
that are not marked with coroutine_fn: any non-blocking syscall fits
in this category (since we don't have control over system headers to
add coroutine_fn annotations to those).  So on that grounds, it is
okay for a function marked coroutine_fn to call another function not
marked coroutine_fn - it just makes the auditing harder to ensure that
you aren't violating your promise of no non-blocking calls.

It's too close to 9.0-rc3 for my comfort to include this patch series.
Even though this bug can cause wedged migrations, I'd feel more
comfortable with preparing the pull request for this series (including
your fix for dropping this one annotation) for 9.1 and for qemu-stable
once the release is complete.
