I do direct kernel boots, as the HSS doesn't work anymore, and just lie
a bit to QEMU about how much DDR we have.
=2EPHONY: qemu-icicle
qemu-icicle:
	$(qemu) -M microchip-icicle-kit \
		-m 3G -smp 5 \
		-kernel $(vmlinux_bin) \
		-dtb $(icicle_dtb) \
		-initrd $(initramfs) \
		-display none -serial null \
		-serial stdio \
		-D qemu.log -d unimp

The platform only supports 2 GiB of DDR, not 3, but if I pass 2 to QEMU
it thinks there's 1 GiB at 0x8000_0000 and 1 GiB at 0x10_0000_0000. The
upstream devicetree (and current FPGA reference design) expects there to
be 1 GiB at 0x8000_0000 and 1 GiB at 0x10_4000_0000. If I lie to QEMU,
it thinks there is 1 GiB at 0x8000_0000 and 2 GiB at 0x10_0000_0000, and
things just work. I prefer doing it this way than having to modify the
DT, it is a lot easier to explain to people this way.

I've been meaning to work the support for the icicle & mpfs in QEMU, but
it just gets shunted down the priority list. I'd really like if a proper
boot flow would run in QEMU, which means fixing whatever broke the HSS,
but I've recently picked up maintainership of dt-binding stuff in Linux,
so I've unfortunately got even less time to try and work on it. Maybe
we'll get some new graduate in and I can make them suffer in my stead...

I don't think it really should be that bad, at least for the direct
kernel boot, which is what I mainly care about, since I use it fairly
often for debugging boot stuff in Linux.

Anyways, aa903cf31391dd505b399627158f1292a6d19896 is the first bad commit:

init_coldboot: ipi init failed (error -1009)

Just to note, because we use our own firmware that vendors in OpenSBI
and compiles only a significantly cut down number of files from it, we
do not use the fw_dynamic etc flow on our hardware. As a result, we have
not tested v1.3, nor do we have any immediate plans to change our
platform firmware to vendor v1.3 either.

I unless there's something obvious to you, it sounds like I will need to
go and bisect OpenSBI. That's a job for another day though, given the
time.

Cheers,
Conor.
