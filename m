You are missing a lot of stuff, but let's start with basics...

First of all, this is not how i2c generally works.  Generally you have a
bus master, the host, that reads and writes to slave devices on the bus.
The devices on the bus don't asynchronously send data to the host.

That said, you can have multiple bus masters on the bus.  If that's what
you are doing, what are you sending your data to?  You have to have
something that will receive it.

If you have some slave device that has data it's holding for the host,
the host has to fetch it.  You could have an interrupt that comes from
the slave device saying it has data, and there's something called SMBus
alert that can consolidate interrupts (though it's not implemented in
QEMU at the moment).

Are you simulating some real device here?
