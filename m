Hi Thomas,

I agree with the urgency.  I've posted the updates here:

   https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-07/msg06236.html

Sorry for the delay, and I hope this gives more time to make the
evolution towards a solution that better suits QEMU.

Regards,
- Cleber.

Indeed, there is no public evidence of that, yet.

Like I said previously, we were working on the project infrastructure.
We haven't ported much code over there yet.  There are very few things
missing, and all of them have been assigned to be worked on.  It's
been tracked here:

   https://github.com/avocado-framework/autils/issues/1

My estimation is that 2-4 weeks for the project infrastructure to be comple=
te.

- Cleber.
