Yeah, probably an oversight.

That text has been in the submitting-a-patch file since day 1, but that
content was originally a copy of the old wiki page, and the wiki edits
never had any formal peer review, so we should be wary of claiming too
much about a consensus.

Going back in history we can see the specific wording arrived with
this change:

  https://wiki.qemu.org/index.php?title=Contribute%2FSubmitAPatch&type=revision&diff=2173&oldid=2094

This may have been an informally held opinion amongst at least some
of those in the community at the time, but don't recall there was a
specific debate about the allowance of psuedonyms, etc.



I have traditionally been in favour of requiring real names, which I
had pretty much interpreted to imply a person's legal name. That was
mostly because I was following what I (apparently incorrectly) thought
was the kernel's intent in this respect.

Looking at the kernel commit above, I have sympathy with the view that
interpreting "real name" too strictly as a "legal name" is exclusionary.

Thus I'd be in favour of following the kernels' clarified intent, which
broadly aligns with the CNCF explanatory text, that "real name" can be
loosely interpreted to be "a commonly known identity in the community".

With regards,
Daniel
