btw here this is the instruction packet I have in mind for a CPU with 
immediate blocks. it has much simpler length decoding than RISC-V and 
less instruction forms too. two regslots can be bonded for a larger 
indirect immediate slot using a constant from the current constant block 
in the constant stream relative to PC/IB. 64-bit instructions can have 6 
inputs/outputs which I have packed for vector in a sketch and it works. 
it doesn't have 48-bit instructions because we simplified length 
decoding compared to RISC-V. and decoding can be more easily vectorized 
than RISC-V but we lost 1 bit in the 16-bit packet due to that. and I 
have a python model that synthesizes logic for parallel decoders

https://anarch128.org/~mclark/VLI.pdf

I'm filling out the 16-bit opcode space. I need to add a constant with a 
(i32,i32) relative immediate to ret to adjust for relative link register 
so the return also needs a constant from the constant block aswell. it's 
symmetrical but I don't have a software model yet.

in two to three years I may have a POC translator. I'm still working on 
codegen for a new X86 backend. for VLI, 16-wide or 8 x 32-bit packets 
(256-bits) is plausible with vastly simpler decode logic than X86. 
that's like a 16/32/64-bit RISC front-end. at the moment I am thinking 
of allowing 16-bit alignment for larger instruction words but I haven't 
tried to synthesize a decoder yet. but I think much simpler than RISC-V 
because 2 wires per packet for length vs up-to 7.
