The copyright/licensing is important, but it was trying to say
more than that to limit the scenarios in which generated code
would be contributed. I think determinism in the tool's operation
is valuable, but probably not the key point to get across here.

We don't want a free for all in hand editting and then contributnig
any auto-generated content. We only want generated content included
where it was explicitly intended that it serve as a "template" for
human refinement.

Determinisism in the sense that if a 2nd person used the same
tool to auto-generate the base template for editting, they would
be starting from the same place as the original contributior.

NB it is trying to say that the way the tool operates is determinstic,
not that its output is neccessarily stable wrt things like sorting.
ie you can rationalize about what the tool is going to emit, but.

With regards,
Daniel
