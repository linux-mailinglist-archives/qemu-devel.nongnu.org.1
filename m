Hi Jonathan,

thanks for posting this. It's a creative usage of plugins.

I think that your current approach, decoupling plugins, CHMU and device 
model is a good thing.

I'm not familiar with CXL, but one question that comes to my mind is:
Is that mandatory to do this analysis during execution (vs dumping 
binary traces from CHMU and plugin and running an analysis post execution)?

Regards,
Pierrick
