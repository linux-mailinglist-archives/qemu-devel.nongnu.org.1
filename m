Interesting corner.  For other 'events' an overflow is natural because
they can be out of the control of the device. This artificial limit
was to trigger the overflow handling in those cases. For this one I'd expect
the device to push back on the fabric management commands, or handle the
event log filling so overflow doesn't happen.

Yes. I think we need to prevent other outstanding events causing us trouble.

Is it useful to support the case where we have more than one
group of extents outstanding?  If not we could simply fail the add whenever
that happens.  Maybe that is a reasonable stop gap until we have a reason
to care about that case. We probably care when we have FM-API hooked up
to this and want to test more advanced fabric management stuff, or poke
a corner of the kernel code perhaps?

I guess from a 'would it be right if a device did this' the answer may be
yes, but that doesn't mean Linux is going to support such a device
(at least not until we know they really exist).  Ira, what do you think
about this corner case?  Maybe detect and scream if we aren't already?
