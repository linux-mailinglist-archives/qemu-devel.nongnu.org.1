I agree that it requires this assumption of not moving slots around,
but I think it's intuitive to assume it when it comes to
doubling/increasing the size of an array, realloc() and g_renew() also
don't shuffle existing elements.

In addition, there already is such an assumption. If slots were moved
around, pointers returned by `return &kml->slots[i];` wouldn't point
to the same slot structure after doubling.

However, I realized there's also another problem with this return
statement. g_renew() could have moved the whole array to a new
address, making all the previously returned pointers invalid. This
could be solved by either adding another layer of indirection, so the
function returns a pointer to a single slot structure that never moves
and the array contains pointers to these structures, or the slots need
to be always accessed through an up-to-date pointer to the array,
probably from another structure or through a getter function. With the
first approach, pointers in the array could shuffle, but with the
second one, the index of a slot must not change during the lifetime of
the slot, keeping the assumption correct.
