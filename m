I agree that we might need to deprecate extensions.

I'm not sure the debug extension is there though. The debug extension
is used in current shipping hardware and has been ratified. The Sdtrig
isn't even ratified yet
(https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-announce/message/320)

Right now I feel that we should at least wait for hardware that
supports Sdtrig to start to come out. Then we can look at deprecating
debug. Deprecating it now seems a bit premature.
