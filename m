Thank you! I should pass NonNull type other than `*mut HPETState` for now :-)

That's the right and ideal way, and I like it.

Yes, I agree. In the next version, I can follow your suggestion and put
these embedded items into instance_init(), to be better prepared for the
next step.

Thank you! I understand your intention. A similar implementation would
also be quite natural in rust_instance_init.

With your help and through our discussions, I have gained a clearer
understanding of this intention.

Thanks for sharing!

Yes, I agree with this idea. It's what we need.
