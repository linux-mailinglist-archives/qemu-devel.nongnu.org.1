Yes, I think it is a replay point. And I don't really know what replay
does when the log has an event that doesn't appear in the code (or the
other way around).

I just don't expect that compatibility of replay logs across QEMU
versions is important (and even if it were important, that it is
achieved, because we probably change the control flow leading to replay
points all the time without even noticing). As far as I understand the
idea is that you want to debug a guest, and during that single debug
session you record a guest and then replay it multiple times. I don't
think it's expected that you keep the replay logs for a long time and
across QEMU updates.
