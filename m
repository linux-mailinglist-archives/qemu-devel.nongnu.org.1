Is this an orthogonal question?

What I meant above is it looks fine to me to keep "device state" in
multifd.c, as long as it is not only about VFIO.

What you were saying seems to be about how to identify this is a device
state, then I just hope VFIO shares the same flag with any future device
that would also like to send its state via multifd, like:

#define MULTIFD_FLAG_DEVICE_STATE (32 << 1)

Then set it in MultiFDPacket_t.flags.  The dest qemu should route that
packet to the device vmsd / save_entry for parsing.

I think as long as the one to enqueue will always setup the fields, we
don't need to do memset.  I am not sure if it's a major concern to always
set all the relevant fields in the multifd enqueue threads.  It sounds like
the thing we should always better do.

I don't think I followed here.

What I meant: QEMU maintains SendData[8], now a bunch of pages arrives, it
enqueues "pages" into a free slot index 2 (set type=pages), then before
thread 2 finished sending the bunch of pages, SendData[2] will always
represent those pages without being used by anything else. What did I miss?

I meant the wire protocol looks great from that POV.  We may need similar
thing for the type==device_state slots just to be generic.
