Oh, yes, there were error messages in the output of dmesg related to
ctrl_vq. After adding the following args, there were no error messages
in dmesg.

-device virtio-net-pci,ctrl_vq=off,ctrl_rx=off,ctrl_vlan=off,ctrl_mac_addr=off

I see that the eth0 interface is also created. I am able to ping L0
from L2 and vice versa as well (even with x-svq=true). This is because
n->promisc is set when these features are disabled and receive_filter() [1]
always returns 1.

I didn't have to set the same mac address in this case since promiscuous
mode seems to be getting enabled which allows pinging to work.

There is another concept that I am a little confused about. In the case
where L2 is booted with x-svq=false (and all ctrl features such as ctrl_vq,
ctrl_rx, etc. are on), I am able to ping L0 from L2. When tracing
receive_filter() in L0-QEMU, I see the values of n->mac and the destination
mac address in the ICMP packet match [2].

I haven't understood what n->mac refers to over here. MAC addresses are
globally unique and so the mac address of the device in L1 should be
different from that in L2. But I see L0-QEMU's n->mac is set to the mac
address of the device in L2 (allowing receive_filter to accept the packet).
