Right, IMHO, this is the terminology that QEMU must use in user
facing APIs.

On x86 we have a conversion tables for named features to register
bits

  https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/blob/master/target/i386/cpu.c#L914

and libvirt does similar

  https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/blob/master/src/cpu_map/x86_features.xml

Yep, it is more work, but it is also much better for humans IMHO.

What I mean is can we define  named models for various different
vendor's Cortex-A silicon and just use that without needing to
toggle features, except in rare cases.
