Google Gemini has the following question. If it can be trusted, it should be
set when @num_of_addresses is larger than 1.

Quota from Google Gemini:

The system firmware sets this bit to indicate to the Operating System Power Management (OSPM)
that more than one correctable error condition has been detected and logged for the associated
hardware component since the last time the status was cleared by the software. This is crucial
because a high frequency of correctable errors often indicates a potential underlying hardware
issue that could lead to uncorrectable (and potentially fatal) errors if not addressed (e.g.,
in memory, where multiple correctable errors might trigger a spare memory operation).

Agreed, lets keep ACPI_HEST_ERROR_ENTRY_COUNT as zero in next revision.
