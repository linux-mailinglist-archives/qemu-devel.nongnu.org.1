Got it.

Would the following comment be acceptable?

/*
 * missing: SM2/SM2_EN, CCS/CCS_EN, PARALLAX/PARALLAX_EN,
 * TM3/TM3_EN, RNG2/RNG2_EN, PHE2/PHE2_EN, RSA/RSA_EN
 */

Do you think I should also include the lore link in the commit message/cover
letter for additional context?

For the CPU model naming/versioning, my plan is:
The current Shijidadao will be equivalent to the old Shijidadao-Client-v2, drop
the old Shijidadao-Client-v1 according to your advice, Shijidadao-v1 will have
the alias Shijidadao-Client, and Shijidadao-v2 will have the alias
Shijidadao-Server.

A key code sketch would look like:

    {
        .name = "Shijidadao",
        .level = 0x1f,
        .vendor = CPUID_VENDOR_ZHAOXIN1,
        .family = 7,
        .model = 0x6b,
        .stepping = 1,
...

        .model_id = "Zhaoxin Shijidadao-Client Processor",
        .cache_info = &shijidadao_cache_info,
        .versions = (X86CPUVersionDefinition[]) {
            { .version = 1, .alias = "Shijidadao-Client" },
            {
                .version = 2,
                .alias = "Shijidadao-Server",
                .note = "server variant",
                .props = (PropValue[]) {
                    { "model", "0x7b" },
                    { "stepping", "0" },
                    { "core-capability", "on" },
                    { "split-lock-detect", "on" },
                    { "model-id",
                      "Zhaoxin Shijidadao-Server Processor" },
                    { /* end of list */ }
                },
            },
            { /* end of list */ }
        }
    },

Does this mapping look acceptable to you?


Best wishes,
Ewan.
