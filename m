Thanks Philippe,

I would like to highlight to the QEMU community here how important this is for SUSE,

to see progress for all the series in the migration area that are currently still waiting and competing for attention.

The specific features and improvements we are developing or helping to review are a priority for us,
and we are concerned about the rate of progress with the existing governance processes.

Fabiano is investing a lot of his attention to this area, with features, bugfixes and reviews,
but of course it is up to the community as a whole to address the issue so that reviewed work is merged.

My attempt here is to make sure that it is recognized as a problem, so it can be hopefully be addressed by the community in a timely fashion,
and we can all benefit from the already developed and reviewed work that is pending.

Thanks!

CLaudio
