Format of the command line; number of entries is something we can change
later.

It probably should also have aidr, just to be safe. (Even if triplets on
the command line will be a bit ugly.)

My question was more along the line of "if the user configures MIDR to
something different from the actual host values, do they need to include
that modified value in the list of target cpus as well?" If we disallow
changing MIDR, we'd naturally sidestep that issue.

That's an interesting question :) I think we can keep it with the
machine state for now until we figure out more details -- it's more
important to actually test it out with real life scenarios.

I think the target ids always need to be figured out and provided by the
user (as only they can possibly have an idea on where that guest might
end up running.) The question is more whether we should give the user
the means to directly configure the regs for a certain instance.
