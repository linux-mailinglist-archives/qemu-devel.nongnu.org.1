I'll just note that I'm only forwarding on the patch from Jakub.
I didn't write it.

I did lightly test it, and it seems to work.  However it seems also
likely that it is causing qemu to block internally.  Probably not
noticable for light use, but not something that we'd want for serious
use.  However if libssh doesn't support non-blocking SFTP there's not
much we can do about that in qemu.

I would recommend using nbdkit-ssh-plugin instead anyway as it is much
more featureful and doesn't have this problem as we use real threads
instead of coroutines.

I posted a v2 which removes the blank line but is otherwise the same.
