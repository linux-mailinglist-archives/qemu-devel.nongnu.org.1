I also work for Kepler project. I use it to monitor my VM has a black=20
box and I used it inside my VM with this feature enable. Thanks to that=20
I can optimize the workloads (dpdk application,database,..) inside my VM.=
=20

This is the use-case in NFV deployment and I'm pretty sure this could be=20
the use-case of many others.

I'm confused about your statement. Like every software power metering=20
tools out is using RAPL (Kepler, Scaphandre, PowerMon, etc) and custom=20
sensors would be better than a what everyone is using ?
The goal is not to be accurate. The goal is to be able to compare=20
A against B in the same environment and RAPL is given reproducible=20
values to do so.
Adding RAPL inside VM makes total sens because you can use tools that=20
are already out in the market.

The other possibility that I've think of is using a 3rd party tool to=20
give maybe more "accurate value" to QEMU.=20
For example, Kepler could be used to give value for each thread=20
of QEMU and so instead of calculating and using the qemu-vmsr-helper,=20
each values is transfered on request by QEMU via the UNIX thread that is=20
used today between the daemon and QEMU. It's just an idea that I have=20
and I don't know if that is acceptable for each project (QEMU and=20
Kepler) that would really solve few issues.
