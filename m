Paolo, first please tone down your condescending tone, it's incredibly 
offensive. I'm honestly certain this is not on purpose otherwise I'd not 
engage at all.

Secondly, are you implying that these callbacks are not operated under 
the BQL? I'm not seeing the C UART devices using mutexes. If they are 
not running under the BQL, then gladly we add mutexes, big deal. Just 
say this directly instead of writing all these amounts of text. If it's 
true I'd just accept it and move on with a new iteration. Isn't that the 
point of code review? It is really that simple. Why not do this right 
away? I'm frankly puzzled.

Finally, this is Rust code. You cannot turn off the type system, you 
cannot turn off the borrow checker, you can only go around creating new 
types and references out of raw memory addresses and tell the compiler 
'trust me on this'. Ignoring that misses the entire point of Rust. The 
statement 'this is not Rust code but as good as C' is dishonest and 
misguided. Check for example the source code of the nix crate, which 
exposes libc and various POSIX/*nix APIs. Is it the same as C and not 
Rust code?

If you have specific scenarios in mind where such things exist in the 
code and end up doing invalid behavior please be kind and write them 
down explicitly and demonstrate them on code review. This approach of 
'yes but no' is not constructive because it is not addressing any 
specific problems directly. Instead it comes out as vague dismissive FUD 
and I'm sure that is not what you or anyone else wants.

Please take some time to understand my POV here, it'd help both of us 
immensely.

Sincerely thank you in advance,
Manos
