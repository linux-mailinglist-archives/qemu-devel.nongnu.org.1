I see what you meant.  It's not called indeed. We may need to process it
the same as what migrate_fd_cleanup() does.

So far the snapshot code reuses migration code in a partial way, so it's
not crystal clear where the line is, e.g., obviously it still moves the
migration state machine but it never shows "active" phase at all (even if
it has a major chunk of duration that it's actively migrating the data to
the snapshot files).  Here the state machine only goes from SETUP to either
FAILED or COMPLETED.

From that POV looks like we should duplicate such s->error detection logic
here on deciding whether to switch to FAILED, if we treat s->error as the
internal "single failure point" for migration.

Yeah you got a point, but I see no good reason to cancel any postcopy
migration, no matter which error it is - either a qemufile error or another
- simply because postcopy cancel means VM crash.  There's nothing worse
that that..

So IMHO we could treat it the same as EIO errors in this case as of now,
and we always pause postcopy no matter which kind of error it hits.  At
least for non-recoverable errors we can have some active process to look
at on src QEMU instance, OTOH there's no direct benefit for us to
differenciate different error cases to crash VM earlier.

Thanks,
