The sam360ex u-boot is changed from upstream U-Boot by the vendor of the 
machine and they did not upstream it, that's why we can't use the same 
u-boot that's used for e500 and need a separate version. The repo for 
sam460ex is mirrored from my repo so I could change it but maybe better 
postpone it after the release and then look at updating to the latest 
firmware version and then fix bugs in that.
