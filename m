Why used_length can change?  I'm looking at ram_mig_ram_block_resized():

    if (!migration_is_idle()) {
        /*
         * Precopy code on the source cannot deal with the size of RAM blocks
         * changing at random points in time - especially after sending the
         * RAM block sizes in the migration stream, they must no longer change.
         * Abort and indicate a proper reason.
         */
        error_setg(&err, "RAM block '%s' resized during precopy.", rb->idstr);
        migration_cancel(err);
        error_free(err);
    }

We sent used_length upfront of a migration during SETUP phase.  Looks like
what you're describing can be something different, though?

Regarding to rb->align: isn't that mostly a constant, reflecting the MR's
alignment?  It's set when ramblock is created IIUC:

    rb->align = mr->align;

When will the alignment change?

I meant I'm thinking whether the new ramblock vmsd may not be required for
the initial implementation.

E.g., IIUC vaddr is required by iommufd, and so far that's not part of the
initial support.

Then I think a major thing is about the fds to be managed that will need to
be shared.  If we put guest_memfd aside, it can be really, mostly, about
VFIO fds.  For that, I'm wondering whether you looked into something like
this:

    vfio/pci: Make vfio cdev pre-openable by passing a file handle

I just notice this when I was thinking of a way where it might be possible
to avoid QEMU vfio-pci open the device at all, then I found we have
something like that already..

Then if the mgmt wants, IIUC that fd can be passed down from Libvirt
cleanly to dest qemu in a no-exec context.  Would this work too, and
cleaner / reusing existing infrastructures?

I think it's nice to always have libvirt managing most, or possible, all
fds that qemu uses, then we don't even need scm_rights.  But I didn't look
deeper into this, just a thought.

When thinking about this, I also wonder how cpr-exec handles the limited
environments like cgroups and especially seccomps.  I'm not sure what's the
status of that in most cloud environments, but I think exec() / fork() is
definitely not always on the seccomp whitelist, and I think that's also
another reason why we can think about avoid using them.
