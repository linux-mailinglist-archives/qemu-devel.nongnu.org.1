I'm definitely supportive of KVM passing on accurate information, so long a=
s KVM's
ABI isn't too crazy.

That said, I'm starting to agree with Rick's assessment that trying to enum=
erate
fixed CPUID feature bits is becoming a fool's errand as the TDX architectur=
e gets
more and more complex.

But _that_ said, if userspace ever needs to pivot on the TDX Module *versio=
n*,
then IMO that's a non-starter.  E.g. QEMU shouldn't have to hardcode fixed0=
/fixed1
bits based on TDX 1.5.whatever vs. TDX 2.0.whatever.

One alternative idea to trying to enumerate every fixed bit would be to mim=
ic what
the VMX architecture does for fixed CR0 bits.  Use TDX Module spec 1.5.06 (=
or whatever
version makes the most sense) as the base, and then adjust fixed/configurab=
le
information based on *features*.  E.g. when unrestricted guest is enabled, =
CR0.PG
and CR0.PE switch from fixed0 to configurable.  At a glance, I think the wh=
ole #VE
reduction madness could follow a similar path.

And then if the TDX tries to add fixed bits in the future that aren't expli=
citly
and clearly tied to some feature enablement, we collectively reject that TD=
X spec.
