Hmm, I wonder why the address space changed during switchover.  I was
expecting the whole address space is updated on qemu boots up, and should
keep as is during migration.  Especially why that matters with mulitifd at
all..  I could have overlooked something.

That's probably the other side of the change when slots grow, comparing to
the pure win where the series definitely should speedup the dirty track
operations quite a bit.

It seems to me we're not far away from the truth.  Anyway, feel free to
update if you figure out the reason, or got some news on profiling.
