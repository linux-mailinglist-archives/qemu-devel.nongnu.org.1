Yep. We can get into it on the pseudofeatures patch. Your analysis here
matches my understanding.

&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi!<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; This series is a very, very barebones implementation for the =
new QAPI<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; doc generator. It does not have many features that I presente=
d on at KVM<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Forum; the point of this patch set is instead to present a st=
ripped down<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; basis for ongoing work so we can discuss on-list with full co=
ntext of<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; the code available to do so.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; The documentation this series generates is *not suitable* for=
 replacing<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; the current document generator, it has a few glaring omission=
s - on<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; purpose - those features have been factored out intentionally=
 so they<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; can be reviewed with fuller context and more careful review.<=
br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; What this series does:<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; - Adds the new &quot;Transmogrifier&quot; rST generator to qa=
pidoc.py, which<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0generates an in-memory rST document using qapi-do=
main directives.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; - Adds a test document that showcases this new transmogrifier=
.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Note to other reviewers: transmogrifier output is<br>
&gt;&gt; docs/manual/qapi/index.html.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; What this series very notably does not do (yet):<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; - &quot;ifcond&quot; data for anything other than top-level e=
ntities is not<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0considered or rendered. This means &quot;if&quot;=
 statements for features and<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0members are entirely absent.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; - The inliner is not present at all. This series renders only=
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0documentation exactly as it is exists in the sour=
ce files.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; This item is not even a regression.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; No; but the version of this series as sent also does not add &quot;The=
 members<br>
&gt; of ...&quot; stubs, which would be a regression.<br>
<br>
Right.<br>
<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =

&gt; elements that require more careful thought isolated into separate patc=

&gt; for later&quot;.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; where &quot;later&quot; means &quot;in v2&quot; or &quot;as a follow-u=
p series as we stage things in<br>
&gt; a development branch before final submission for inclusion to<br>
&gt; origin/master&quot; or whatever the actual mechanism is. I don&#39;t h=
ave a strong<br>
&gt; vision there, really; I just wanted to nail down the basics out in the=

&gt; even if that was just between you (Markus) and I and we have a gentlem=

<br>

<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; - *branches* are themselves not considered at all; they&#39;r=

&gt;&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 entirely for now. They will be included alongsid=

&gt;&gt; What exactly are &quot;pseudofeatures&quot;?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; What I&#39;ve named things like allow-oob that aren&#39;t features, bu=
t ought to be<br>
&gt; documented. We may well decide to promote them to real-deal special<br=
>
&gt; features, or maybe not. My work-in-progress branch currently just adds=
<br>
&gt; &quot;dummy&quot; features to document them. We can discuss this later=
 alongside the<br>
&gt; patch that implements this.<br>
<br>
I agree this is a digression, so feel free to ignore the remainder of my<br=
>
reply for now.<br>
<br>
We have two kinds of flags in the QAPI schema language: features and ad<br>
hoc flags.=C2=A0 The ad hoc flags are &#39;boxed&#39; (commands and events)=
, &#39;gen&#39;,<br>
&#39;success-response&#39;, &#39;allow-oob&#39;, &#39;allow-preconfig&#39;,=
 &#39;coroutine&#39;<br>
(commands only).<br>
<br>
The flags sort into three buckets:<br>
<br>
1. Code generation directives that do not affect the external interface,<br=
>
and thus should not be visible in introspection: &#39;boxed&#39;, &#39;gen&=
#39;,<br>
&#39;coroutine&#39;.<br>
<br>
2. Flags that are visible at the external interface, but don&#39;t affect<b=
r>
code generation beyond making them visible in introspection: the<br>
non-special features.<br>
<br>
3. Code generation directives that affect the external interface, and<br>
thus are (or should be) visible in introspection.<br>
<br>
3a. The special features: are visible.<br>
<br>
3b. &#39;allow-oob&#39;: is visible, but differently, because it predates<b=
r>
special features.<br>
<br>
3c. &#39;allow-preconfig&#39;: not visible.<br>
<br>
3d. &#39;success-response&#39;: not visible, because we use it for QGA only=
,<br>
which doesn&#39;t provide introspection.<br>
