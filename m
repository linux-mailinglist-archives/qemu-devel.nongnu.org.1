When using machine properties, these things should already be set by the
machine types.

E.g. if this is a new QEMU with an old machine type, we should have this
per-device property set to OFF forever when booting the VM, and should keep
it like that after any rounds of migrations.  Because any VM using the old
machine type _might_ be migrated back to an older QEMU that won't support
it.  So IIUC that strictly follows how we use versioned machine types.

What Vladimir mentioned previously would be something very special, but
indeed when there's no machine type versioning we may need to toggle this
before each migration.  However since upstream is following the machine
type properties way of doing this since N years ago, do we need to worry
about that?

Right, this might be a real need if it exists.  Said that, it's so special
that I'm not sure whether the admin can easily migrate with global
backend-transfer to OFF in this rare case.

In general, I would prefer avoiding to introduce any form of list of
devices into the migration system if ever possible.  I agree if we must
introduce that it should at least be a list of IDs rather than adhoc array
of strings.  However I still want to see whether we can completely avoid
it.

Thanks,
