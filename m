The argument for inlining the arguments equally applies to results:
"users will not have to grep around the page".

102 out of 236 commands return something, usually some object type or an
array of some object type.  Most of these types are used for exactly one
command's return and nothing else.

Regardless, it's fine to explore inlining just for arguments.  If we can
make that work, extending it to return results shouldn't be too hard.

From (hazy) memory: when full QMP and storage daemon QMP both include a
sub-module for its types, but full QMP uses more of its types than
storage daemon QMP does, the storage daemon manual elides more of its
types than the QMP manual does.  However, sphinx-build's caching uses
whatever got built first for *both* manuals.  When we happen to build
the full QMP manual first, we end up with extra types in the storage
daemon manual.  When we happen to build the storage daemon manual first,
the full manual is missing types.

Is it worth it?  How useful is the separate QEMU Storage Daemon QMP
Reference Manual?  It's an exact duplicate of selected chapters of the
QEMU QMP Reference Manual...  Could we instead document "QMP, but only
these chapters"?

Diversion: can we come up with a better way of subsetting the full QAPI
schema for the storage daemon?

We currently subset by having storage-daemon/qapi/qapi-schema.json a
subset of the submodules qapi/qapi-schema.json includes.  The code
generated for the entire schema differs (basically qapi-init-commands.c,
qapi-emit-events.[ch], and qapi-introspect.c).  The code generated for
the submodules should be identical (modulo unused array types, but
that's harmless detail).  So we ignore the code generated for the
storage daemon's submodules.

End of diversion.

I'm not disputing the idea that documenting the arguments right with the
command is good.  I'm merely pointing out obstacles to pulling that off.

Adjusting existing documentation is only half the battle.  The other
half is making sure documentation stays adjusted.  We may have to come
up with new documentation rules, and ways to enforce them.
