This commit also seems to break display with some VGA ROMs as can be 
reproduced with:

qemu-system-ppc -machine pegasos2 -bios pegasos2.rom -serial stdio -vga none -device ati-vga,romfile=ati-rage128progl16mb.VBI

where the romfile is something from 
http://vgamuseum.info/index.php/companies/item/111-ati-rage-128-pro for 
example). Until commit 35a6380b4ed27f^ you get picture on emulated VGA but 
not after (although I have no idea what a VGA BIOS has to do with the 
parallel port). Any idea how to fix this?
