I'll go ahead and remove it.  The current plan is I'll skip the deprecation
procedure for this one because I don't expect anyone would read the
deprecation notification at all... aka, no real user I can ever think of,
who only cares about source pinning not dest.

I'll pick patch 2 out and send separately, which is still a cleanup without
the query-migrationthreads API.

We can keep the discussion going in the new patch.
