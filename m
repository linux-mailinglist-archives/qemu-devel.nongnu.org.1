For the TIMEOUT part on cross-i686-tci I plan to try this patch:
https://patchew.org/QEMU/20240912151003.2045031-1-peter.maydell@linaro.org/
which makes 'make check' single-threaded; that will help to see
if the parallelism is a problem. (If it is then we might want
to do a more generalised approach rather than just for that one
CI job.)

If you think that specific test is flaky then I think that's
probably a good idea. As usual with this kind of thing,
probably best to have a comment next to the test noting
why and with a URL to a gitlab issue for it, so we don't
forget why we disabled the test.
