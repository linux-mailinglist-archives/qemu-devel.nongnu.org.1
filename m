Let's do it this way: As explained in

"Re: [PATCH v2 07/20] mcd: Implement target initialization API"
<a71a747f-d8c3-40ac-ab61-0628dffbb2f6@lauterbach.com>

there are reasons to deviate from mcd/mcd_api.h in mcd/qapi-schema.json.
In v3, I can highlight those changes briefly in the relevant commit
messages. That way, you have the option to focus on the non-trivial parts.
