Sigh, I made a mistake here, this should read:
 
  * 'make check' / 'make check-block'
 
     => runs only 'auto' qcow2 tests  (unchanged)

The 'make check-block SPEED=thorough/slow' feature was removed
on the basis that running all targets at once is not that
useful, instead the 'check-block-$FORMAT' targets are
replacing it. IOW the meson 'block-slow' and 'block-through'
suites are gone.
