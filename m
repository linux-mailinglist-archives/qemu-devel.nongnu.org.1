AFAICT, all accesses are either in a function with GLOBAL_STATE_CODE()
directly or in a function with GRAPH_WRLOCK (in the cases of
bdrv_replace_child_tran() and bdrv_replace_child_noperm()).

This does not change for the new accesses added by the series here.

Back then, there was no GLOBAL_STATE_CODE() macro yet, so I suppose this
wasn't easy to verify.

I'd add a patch dropping the atomic accesses and document that
quiesce_counter can only be accessed in the main thread.
