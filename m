For this R100 card APER_SIZE matches MEMSIZE but the BAR length is twice 
that. Maybe the other card you get will shed some light on what's going on 
with Radeon. I've looked up what the FCode ROM I've tested was doing. This 
is from a Card#109-85500-00 Rom#113-85501-226 according to the IDs it sets 
in the device tree, probably from a PowerMac but I don't have the card 
just found this ROM. The detokenized part of this Radeon 7000/RV100 ROM 
that accesses CONFIG_APER_SIZE looks like this:

   7321: const_REG_CONFIG_APER_SIZE
   7323: ati-reg-l@
   7325: dup
   7326: b(to) var_aper_size
   7329: 2*
   7330: b(to) var_ram_size
   7333: const_REG_CONFIG_REG_APER_SIZE
   7335: ati-reg-l@
   7337: 2*
   7338: b(to) var_mmio_size

The variable names were invented by me so it's possible that it actually 
means vram and mmio BAR size but it does 2* for both the VRAM and REG 
APERS and this is the size it then uses for map-in and map-out calls so 
this suggests these registers are half of the BAR size at least for this 
card.

I only have a Rage Mobility M6 Design Guide (M6 is another name for RV100) 
that talks about memory size and it says that it's minimum 8MB maximum 
64MB but could be R100 supported more. It's still possible that the BAR 
size is twice the VRAM size for some reason but we don't have enough 
evidence for that.
