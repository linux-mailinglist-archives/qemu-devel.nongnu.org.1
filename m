We've been waffling on this since forever.  QOM is not a public
interface except when it is, and it is when somebody says so, and it
isn't when somebody says so, resulting in a wave function that wobbles
like an underdone souffle, but never quite collapses.

Plenty of commands take QOM paths as arguments: eject,
blockdev-open-tray, blockdev-close-tray, blockdev-remove-medium,
blockdev-insert-medium, blockdev-change-medium,
block-latency-histogram-set, cxl-inject-general-media-event,
cxl-inject-dram-event, cxl-inject-memory-module-event,
cxl-inject-poison, cxl-inject-uncorrectable-errors,
cxl-inject-correctable-error, device_del, device-sync-config,
query-stats, x-query-virtio-status, x-query-virtio-queue-status,
x-query-virtio-vhost-queue-status, x-query-virtio-queue-element, and
possibly more.

The only way their QOM path arguments can be used without relying on QOM
paths being ABI would be obtaining the argument value with a command or
from an event.  I doubt that would be possible even if we tried it,
which we haven't.

/machine/unattached was a lazy mistake.

Can you suggest a better, workable naming scheme?

Yes, but users can avoid that by passing an @id argument.
