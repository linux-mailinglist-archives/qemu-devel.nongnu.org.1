That's when your VM instance only runs on demand for a few seconds 
before going to sleep again
until the next user request comes in.

This isn't really related to migration though. Serverless is based on 
constantly stopping and resuming the VM on e.g. every HTTP request to an 
endpoint.

As far as Markus' comment goes, I propose we go the broadcast route, and 
just add the -broadcast suffix to the current command name.

If everyone is okay with that, I will submit a v3.
