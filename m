============
(I) Prologue
============

This patch series adds support for a virtual CPU hotplug-like feature (in terms
of usage) to Armv8+ platforms. Administrators are able to dynamically scale the
compute capacity on demand by adding or removing vCPUs. The interface is similar
in look-and-feel to the vCPU hotplug feature supported on x86 platforms. While
this series for Arm platforms shares the end goal with x86, it is implemented
differently because of inherent differences in the CPU architecture and the
constraints it imposes.

In this implementation, the meaning of "CPU hotplug" is as described in the Arm
Power State Coordination Interface (PSCI) specification (DEN0022F.b, ยง4.3 "CPU
hotplug and secondary CPU boot", ยง5.5, 5.6). This definition has not changed.
On Arm platforms, the guest kernel itself can request CPU onlining or offlining
using PSCI calls (via SMC/HVC), since the CPU_ON and CPU_OFF functions are part
of the standard PSCI interface exposed to the non-secure world.

This patch series instead adds the infrastructure required to implement
administrative policy control in QEMU/VMM (as privileged software) along with
the ability to convey changes via ACPI to the guest kernel. This ensures the
guest is notified of compute capacity changes that result from per-vCPU
administrative policy. This is conceptually similar to the traditional CPU
hotplug mechanism that x86 follows. It allows or denies guest-initiated PSCI
CPU_ON/OFF requests by enabling or disabling an already ACPI-described and
present vCPU via HMP/QMP 'device_set' (a new interface), making it (un)available
to the guest kernel. This provides the look-and-feel of vCPU hotplug through
ACPI _STA.Enabled toggling, while keeping all vCPUs enumerated in ACPI tables at
boot.

Unlike x86, where vCPUs can become not-present after boot and the kernel (maybe
because architecture allows this?) tolerates some level of dynamic topology
changes, the Arm CPU Architecture requires that the number of vCPUs and their
associated redistributors remain fixed once the system has booted. Consequently,
the Arm host kernel and guest kernel do not tolerate removal or addition of CPU
objects after boot.

Offline vCPUs remain described to guest firmware and OSPM, and can be brought
online later by toggling the ACPI _STA Enabled bit. This model aligns with
ACPI 6.5 (Table 5.37, GICC CPU Interface Flags), which introduced the "Online
Capable" bit to signal processors that can be enabled at runtime. It is also
consistent with the Arm GIC Architecture Specification (IHI0069H, ยง11.1), which
defines CPU interface power domain behavior.

Corresponding kernel changes from James Morse (ARM) have already been accepted
and are part of the mainline Linux kernel since 6.11 release.

---------------------------------
[!] Expectations From This RFC v6
---------------------------------

Please refer to the DISCLAIMER in Section (XI) for the correct expectations from
this version of the RFC

===============
(II) Motivation
===============

Adds virtual CPU hot-plug-like support for ARMv8+ Arch in QEMU. Allows vCPUs to
be brought online or offline after VM boot, similar to x86 arch, while keeping
all CPU resources provisioned and described at startup. Enables scaling guest VM
compute capacity on demand, useful in several scenarios:

1. Vertical Pod Autoscaling [9][10] in the cloud: As part of an orchestration
   framework, resource requests (CPU and memory) for containers in a pod can be
   adjusted dynamically based on usage.

2. Pay-as-you-grow business model: Infrastructure providers may allocate and
   restrict the total compute resources available to a guest VM according to
   the SLA (Service Level Agreement). VM owners can then request additional
   CPUs to be hot-plugged at extra cost.

In Kubernetes environments, workloads such as Kata Container VMs often adopt
a "hot-plug everything" model: start with the minimum resources and add vCPUs
later as needed. For example, a VM may boot with just one vCPU, then scale up
once the workload is provisioned. This approach provides:

1. Faster boot times, and
2. Lower memory footprint.

vCPU hot-plug is therefore one of the steps toward realizing the broader
"hot-plug everything" objective. Other hot-plug mechanisms already exist on ARM,
such as ACPI-based memory hot-plug and PCIe device hot-plug, and are supported
in both QEMU and the Linux guest. Extending vCPU hot-plug in this series aligns
with those efforts and fills the remaining gap.

================
(III) Background
================

The ARM architecture does not support physical CPU hot-plug and lacks a
specification describing the behavior of per-CPU components (e.g. GIC CPU
interface, redistributors, PMUs, timers) when such events occur. As a result,
both host and guest kernels are intolerant to changes in the number of CPUs
enumerated by firmware and described by ACPI at boot time.

We need to respect these architectural constraints and the kernel limitations
they impose, namely the inability to tolerate changes in the number of CPUs
enumerated by firmware once the system has booted, and create a practical
solution with workarounds in the VMM/QEMU.

This patch set implements a non-intrusive solution by provisioning all vCPU
resources during VM initialization and exposing them via ACPI to the guest
kernel. The resources remain fixed, while the effect of hot-plug is achieved by
toggling ACPI CPU status (enabled) bits to bring vCPUs online or offline.

-----------
Terminology
-----------

(*) Possible CPUs: Total vCPUs that could ever exist in the VM. This includes
                   any 'present' & 'enabled' CPUs plus any CPUs that are
                   'present' but are 'disabled' at boottime.
                   - Qemu parameter (-smp cpus=N1, disabled=N2)
                   - Possible vCPUs = N1 + N2
(*) Present CPUs:  Possible CPUs that are ACPI 'present'. These might or might
                   not be ACPI 'enabled'. 
(*) Enabled CPUs:  Possible CPUs that are ACPI 'present' and 'enabled' and can
                   now be โonlinedโ (PSCI) for use by the Guest Kernel. All cold-
                   booted vCPUs are ACPI 'enabled' at boot. Later, using
                   'device_set/-deviceset', more vCPUs can be ACPI 'enabled'.


Below are further details of the constraints:

===============================================
(IV) Constraints Due to ARMv8+ CPU Architecture
===============================================

A. Physical Limitation to Support CPU Hotplug: (Architectural Constraint)

   1. ARMv8 CPU architecture does not support the concept of the physical CPU
      hotplug. 
      a. There are many per-CPU components like PMU, SVE, MTE, Arch timers, etc.,
         whose behavior needs to be clearly defined when the CPU is
         hot(un)plugged. Current specification does not define this nor are any
         immediate plans from ARM to extend support for such a feature.
   2. Other ARM components like GIC, etc., have not been designed to realize
      physical CPU hotplug capability as of now. For example,
      a. Every physical CPU has a unique GICC (GIC CPU Interface) by construct.
         Architecture does not specify what CPU hot(un)plug would mean in
         context to any of these.
      b. CPUs/GICC are physically connected to unique GICR (GIC Redistributor).
         GIC Redistributors are always part of the always-on power domain. Hence,
         they cannot be powered off as per specification.

B. Limitation in Firmware/ACPI (Architectural Constraint)

   1. Firmware has to expose GICC, GICR, and other per-CPU features like PMU,
      SVE, MTE, Arch Timers, etc., to the OS. Due to the architectural constraint
      stated in section A1(a), all interrupt controller structures of
      MADT describing GIC CPU Interfaces and the GIC Redistributors MUST be
      presented by firmware to the OSPM during boot time.
   2. Architectures that support CPU hotplug can evaluate the ACPI _MAT method
      to get this kind of information from the firmware even after boot, and the
      OSPM has the capability to process these. ARM kernel uses information in
      MADT interrupt controller structures to identify the number of present CPUs
      during boot and hence does not allow to change these after boot. The number
      of present CPUs cannot be changed. It is an architectural constraint!

C. Limitations in KVM to Support Virtual CPU Hotplug (Architectural Constraint)

   1. KVM VGIC:
      a. Sizing of various VGIC resources like memory regions, etc., related to
         the redistributor happens only once and is fixed at the VM init time
         and cannot be changed later after initialization has happened.
         KVM statically configures these resources based on the number of vCPUs
         and the number/size of redistributor ranges.
      b. Association between vCPU and its VGIC redistributor is fixed at the
         VM init time within the KVM, i.e., when redistributor iodevs gets
         registered. VGIC does not allow to setup/change this association
         after VM initialization has happened. Physically, every CPU/GICC is
         uniquely connected with its redistributor, and there is no
         architectural way to set this up.
   2. KVM vCPUs:
      a. Lack of specification means destruction of KVM vCPUs does not exist as
         there is no reference to tell what to do with other per-vCPU
         components like redistributors, arch timer, etc.
      b. In fact, KVM does not implement the destruction of vCPUs for any
         architecture. This is independent of whether the architecture
         actually supports CPU Hotplug feature. For example, even for x86 KVM
         does not implement the destruction of vCPUs.

D. Considerations in Qemu due to ARM CPU Architecture & related KVM Constraints:

   1. Qemu CPU Objects MUST be created to initialize all the Host KVM vCPUs to
      overcome the KVM constraint. KVM vCPUs are created and initialized when
      Qemu CPU Objects are realized.
   2. The 'GICV3State' and 'GICV3CPUState' objects must be sized for all possible
      vCPUs at VM initialization, when the QOM GICv3 object is realized. This is
      required because the KVM VGIC can only be initialized once, and the number
      of redistributors, their per-vCPU interfaces, and associated data
      structures or I/O device regions are all fixed at VM init time.
   3. How should new QOM CPU objects be connected back to the 'GICV3CPUState'
      objects and disconnected from it in case the CPU is being hot(un)plugged?
   4. How should 'unplugged' or 'yet-to-be-plugged' vCPUs be represented in the
      QOM for which KVM vCPU already exists? For example, whether to keep,
       a. No QOM CPU objects Or
       b. Unrealized CPU Objects
   5. How should vCPU state be exposed via ACPI to the Guest? Especially for
      the unplugged/yet-to-be-plugged vCPUs whose CPU objects might not exist
      within the QOM but the Guest always expects all possible vCPUs to be
      identified as ACPI *present* during boot.
   6. How should Qemu expose GIC CPU interfaces for the unplugged or
      yet-to-be-plugged vCPUs using ACPI MADT Table to the Guest?

E. How are the above questions addressed in this QEMU implementation?

   1. Respect the limitations imposed by the Arm architecture in KVM, ACPI, and
      the guest kernel. This requires always keeping the vCPU count constant.
   2. Implement a workaround in QEMU by keeping all vCPUs present and toggling
      the ACPI _STA.Enabled bit to realize a vCPU hotplug-like effect.
   3. Never destroy vCPU objects once initialized, since they hold the ARMCPU
      state that is set up once during VM initialization.
   4. Size other per-vCPU components, such as the VGIC CPU interface and
      redistributors, for the maximum number of vCPUs possible during the VMโs
      lifetime.
   5. Exit HVC/SMC KVM hypercalls (triggered by PSCI CPU_ON/OFF) to user space
      for policy checks that allow or deny the guest kernelโs power-on/off
      request.
   6. Disabled vCPUs remain parked in user space and are never migrated.

===================  
(V) Summary of Flow  
===================  

-------------------  
vCPU Initialization  
-------------------  
   1. Keep all vCPUs always enumerated and present (enabled/disabled) in the
      guest kernel, host KVM, and QEMU with topology fixed.  
   2. Realize hotplug-like functionality by toggling the ACPI _STA.Enabled bit
      for each vCPU.  
   3. Never destroy a vCPU. vCPU objects and threads remain alive throughout the
      VM lifetime once created. No un-realization handling code is required.
      Threads may be realized lazily for disabled vCPUs.  
   4. At VM init, pre-create all possible vCPUs in KVM, including those not yet
      enabled in QEMU, but keep them in the PSCI powered-off state.  
   5. Park disabled vCPU threads in user space to avoid KVM lock contention.
      This means 'CPUState::halted=1'; 'CPUState::stopped=1'; and 'CPUState::parked=1' (new).  
-------------------  
VGIC Initialization  
-------------------  
   6. Size 'GICv3State' and 'GICv3CPUState' objects over possible vCPUs at VM
      init time when the QEMU GIC is realized. This also sizes KVM VGIC
      resources such  as redistributor regions. This sizing never changes after
      VM init.
-------------------  
ACPI Initialization  
-------------------  
   7. Build the ACPI MADT table with updates:  
      a. Number of GIC CPU interface entries = possible vCPUs.  
      b. Boot vCPU as MADT.GICC.Enabled=1 (not hot[un]pluggable).  
      c. Hot[un]pluggable vCPUs as MADT.GICC.online-capable=1 and  
         MADT.GICC.Enabled=0 (mutually exclusive). These vCPUs can be enabled
         and onlined after guest boot (firmware policy).  
   8. Expose ACPI _STA status to the guest kernel:  
      a. Always _STA.Present=1 (all possible vCPUs).  
      b. _STA.Enabled=1 (enabled vCPUs = plugged).  
      c. _STA.Enabled=0 (disabled vCPUs = unplugged).  
---------------------------------------------------------------  
vCPU Administrative *First* Enable [= vCPU Hotplug-like Action]  
---------------------------------------------------------------  
   9. The first administrative enable of a vCPU leads to deferred realization of
      the QEMU vCPU object initialized at VM init:  
      a. Realizes the vCPU object and spawns the QEMU vCPU thread.  
      b. Unparks the existing KVM vCPU ("kvm_parked_vcpus" list).  
      c. Reinitializes the KVM vCPU in the host (reset core/sys regs, set
         defaults). 
      d. Runs the KVM vCPU (created with 'start-powered-off'). Thread waits for
         PSCI.
      e. Marks QEMU 'GICv3CPUState' interface accessible.  
      f. Updates ACPI _STA.Enabled=1.  
      g. Notifies guest (GED Device-Check). Guest sees Enabled=1 and registers
         CPU. 
      h. Guest onlines vCPU (PSCI CPU_ON over HVC/SMC).  
         - KVM exits to QEMU (policy check).  
         - If allowed, QEMU calls `cpu_reset()` and powers on the vCPU in KVM.
	 - KVM wakes vCPU thread out of sleep and puts vCPUMP state to RUNNABLE 
-----------------------------------------------------------  
vCPU Administrative Disable [= vCPU Hot-unplug-like Action]  
-----------------------------------------------------------  
  10. Administrative disable does not un-realize the QOM CPU object or destroy
      the vCPU thread. Instead:  
      a. Notifies guest (GED Eject Request). Guest offlines vCPU (CPU_OFF PSCI).
      b. KVM exits to QEMU (policy check). 
         - QEMU powers off vCPU in KVM and
	 - KVM puts vCPUMP state to STOPPED & sleeps on RCUWait
      c. Guest signals eject after quiescing vCPU.  
      d. QEMU updates ACPI _STA.Enabled=0.  
      e. Marks QEMU 'GICv3CPUState' interface inaccessible.  
      f. Parks the vCPU thread in user space (unblocks from KVM to avoid vCPU
         lock contention):  
         - Unregisters VMSD from migration.  
         - Removes vCPU from present/active lists.  
         - Pauses the vCPU (`cpu_pause`).  
         - Kicks vCPU thread to user space ('CPUState::parked=1').  
      g. Guest sees ACPI _STA.Enabled=0 and removes CPU (unregisters from LDM).
--------------------------------------------------------------------  
vCPU Administrative *Subsequent* Enable [= vCPU Hotplug-like Action]  
--------------------------------------------------------------------  
  11. A subsequent administrative enable does not realize objects or spawn a new
      thread. Instead:  
      a. Unparks the vCPU thread in user space:  
         - Re-registers VMSD for migration.  
         - Adds back to present/active lists.  
         - Resumes the vCPU (`cpu_resume`).  
         - Clears parked flag ('CPUState::parked=0').  
      b. Marks QEMU 'GICv3CPUState' interface accessible again.  
      c. Updates ACPI _STA.Enabled=1.  
      d. Notifies guest (GED Device-Check). Guest sees Enabled=1 and registers
         CPU.
      e. Guest onlines vCPU (PSCI CPU_ON over HVC/SMC).  
         - KVM exits to QEMU (policy check).  
         - QEMU sets power-state=PSCI_ON, calls `cpu_reset()`, and powers on
	   vCPU.  
         - KVM changes MP state to RUNNABLE.

===================
(VII) Commands Used
===================

A. Qemu launch commands to init the machine (with 6 possible vCPUs):

$ qemu-system-aarch64 --enable-kvm -machine virt,gic-version=3 \
-cpu host -smp cpus=4,disabled=2 \
-m 300M \
-kernel Image \
-initrd rootfs.cpio.gz \
-append "console=ttyAMA0 root=/dev/ram rdinit=/init maxcpus=2 acpi=force" \
-nographic \
-bios QEMU_EFI.fd \

B. Administrative '[En,Dis]able' [akin to 'Hot-(un)plug'] related commands:

# Hot(un)plug a host vCPU (accel=kvm):
(qemu) device_set host-arm-cpu,id=core4,core-id=4,admin-state=enable
(qemu) device_set host-arm-cpu,id=core4,core-id=4,admin-state=disable

# Hot(un)plug a vCPU (accel=tcg):
(qemu) device_set cortex-a57-arm-cpu,id=core4,core-id=4,admin-state=enable
(qemu) device_set cortex-a57-arm-cpu,id=core4,core-id=4,admin-state=disable

Sample output on guest after boot:

    $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/possible
    0-5
    $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/present
    0-5
    $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/enabled
    0-3
    $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/online
    0-1
    $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/offline
    2-5

Sample output on guest after 'enabling'[='hotplug'] & 'online' of vCPU=4:

    $ echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu4/online

    $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/possible
    0-5
    $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/present
    0-5
    $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/enabled
    0-4
    $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/online
    0-1,4
    $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/offline
    2-3,5

(VIII) Repositories
===================

(*) Latest Qemu RFC V6 (Architecture Specific) patch set:

================================
(IX) KNOWN ISSUES & THINGS TO DO
================================

1. TCG currently faces some hang issues due to unhandled cases. We aim to fix
   these within the next one to two weeks.
2. Comprehensive testing is ongoing. This is fresh code, and we expect to
   complete testing within two weeks.
3. QEMU documentation (.rst) still needs to be updated.
4. Migration has been lightly tested but is working as expected.
5. Mitigation to avoid `pause_all_vcpus` needs broader community discussion. An
   alternative change has been prepared in KVM, which maintains a shadow of
   `ICC_CTLR_EL1` to reduce lock contention when using KVM device IOCTLs. This
   avoids synchronization issues if the register value changes during VM runtime.
   While not mandatory, this enhancement would provide a more comprehensive fix
   than the current QEMU assumption that the relevant fields are invariant or
   pseudo-static. An RFC for this KVM change will be floated within a week.
6. Mitigation of parking disabled vCPU threads in user space, to avoid blocking
   them inside KVM, needs review by the wider community to ensure no hidden
   issues are introduced.
7. A discussion (if needed) on why `device_set` was chosen instead of `qom-set`
   for administrative state control.
8. CPU_SUSPEND/Standy related handling (if required)
9. HVF and qtest are not supported or done yet.

===============
(XI) DISCLAIMER
===============

This patch-set is the culmination of over four years of ongoing effort to bring
a vCPU hotplug-like feature to the Arm platform. The work has already led to
changes in the ACPI specification and the Linux kernel, and this series now
introduces the missing piece within QEMU.

The transition from RFC v5 to RFC v6 resulted in a shift of approach, based on
maintainer feedback, and required substantial code to be re-written. This is
*not* production-level code and may still contain bugs. Comprehensive testing is
in progress on HiSilicon Kunpeng920 SoCs, Oracle servers, and Ampere platforms.
We expect to fix outstanding issues in the coming month and, subject to no major
concerns from maintainers about the chosen approach, a near-stable, non-RFC
version will be posted soon.

This work largely follows the direction of prior community discussions over the
years [see refs below], including mailing list threads, Linaro Open Discussions,
and sessions at KVM Forum. This RFC is intended to validate the overall approach
outlined here and to gather community feedback before moving forward with a
formal patch series.

[The concept being presented has been found to work!]
