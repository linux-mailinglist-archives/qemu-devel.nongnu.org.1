The benefit is that QEMU would not have to maintain 10 backends and
all the audio mixing/resampling. The QEMU code would be simpler and
more maintainable overall. GStreamer has a clear pipeline design,
better suited (optimized code etc) and you can easily modify the
pipeline settings.

That's indeed a complicated subject and hard to test & measure. Adding
some testing to our audio infra should help identify this better. Not
sure when time permits though.

It seems to me that the current QEMU audio code is using the
virtual/system clock timer to pull the data at a regular pace, which
is not in sync with the actual audio sink clock. The GStreamer
pipeline, otoh, uses the audio sink clock. But there are other
emulated devices related issues (like hda not sending data when asked,
or later, it has to be pulled regularly etc). I need to study this in
more detail, this GStreamer implementation is a bit naive there.

Yes, I think synchronization of audio/video playback for remoting is
another issue, if QEMU has the audio & video frames in sync which can
provide correct timestamps.

(by default QEMU is still doing resampling & mixing, and adds extra bufferi=
ng)

A GStreamer backend should not be incompatible with those use cases.

I agree with the goal that we should leave most of the work to the
host, and not have to do audio mixing resampling ourself whenever
possible. Imho, GStreamer allows us to do that in less and cleaner
code.
