+CC OpenSBI Mailing list

I've not yet had the chance to bisect this, so adding the OpenSBI folks
to CC in case they might have an idea for what to try.

And a question for you below Daniel.

Why am I seeing these warnings? Does the mpfs machine type need to
disable some things? It only supports rv64imafdc per the DT, and
predates things like Zca existing, so emitting warnings does not seem
fair at all to me!
