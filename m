Thanks!

Yes, and/or "why isn't the test forcing a pylint version?"
and/or "why is the test run by default if it depends on
the pylint version?" :-)

> Very likely: pylint version differences. I've been meaning to remove iote=
st 297 for a long time, but when you run it directly through iotests (i.e. =
not through the python directory tests, the ones that run on gitlab ci), th=
e linter versions are not controlled for. It's a remaining ugly spot of the=
 python consistency work. (sparing you the details on why but it's a known =
thing I need to fix.)

I kicked off a job by hand, and yes, it fails, but apparently
not for the same set of errors as the above...

 linter versions, and delete iotest 297.

(pyvenv) e104462:jammy:x86-tgts$ pylint --version
pylint 2.12.2
astroid 2.9.3
Python 3.10.12 (main, Sep 11 2024, 15:47:36) [GCC 11.4.0]
