This raises the question if the better interface wouldn't be to change
the BlockExportOptions.iothread from 'str' to an alternate between 'str'
and ['str'], allowing the user to specify multiple iothreads in the
already existing related option without creating conflicting options.

In the long run, I would be surprised if FUSE remained the only export
supporting multiple iothreads. At least the virtio based ones
(vhost-user-blk and VDUSE) even have precedence in the virtio-blk device
itself, so while I don't know how much interest there is in actually
implementing it, in theory we know it makes sense.
