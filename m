I think that is what caught me off guard. I'm learning how to submit the
correctly formatted patch. I would very much like to disconnect the patch
From: from the email From: line.

Good catch. I have no problem modifying the patch with better logic for a
zero length packet.

I&#39;m asking because our basic expected position is &quot;commits<br>

br>
we can&#39;t tell if people use a consistent plausible looking<br>
pseudonym whether that corresponds to their real-world name<br>
or not, but if you have a real name you&#39;re happy to attach<br>
to this patch and are merely using a pseudonym for Google<br>
email, then the resubmit of this patch didn&#39;t seem to me<br>
