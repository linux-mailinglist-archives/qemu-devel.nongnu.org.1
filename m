If another thread opens a new file descriptor, the kernel will hand out
the lowest numbered available file descriptor. That fd could be the
FUSE-over-io_uring fd that was just closed by the main loop thread while
the IOThread is still waiting for CQEs or in the middle of processing a
FUSE-over-io_uring request. An IOThread must not use the stale fd (e.g.
as part of an io_uring SQE) thinking it is a FUSE fd.

Yes. I would refine the FUSE-over-io_uring part like this:

I remember we discussed scheduling a BH in the IOThreads so they can
call close(2). That way there's no race between the IOThreads, which are
still using the fds, and the main loop thread, which is in shutdown().

It sounds like the main loop thread should only umount once all
IOThreads have closed their fds. The IOThreads will need to notify the
main loop thread when they are done. An async callback in the main loop
thread will invoke umount and drop the reference to the export. Then
delete() will finally be called.

If someone can think of a way to achieve the same thing with less
synchronization, that would be simpler. But if not, then I think we need
this for correctness (to avoid the race with IOThreads still using the
fd).
