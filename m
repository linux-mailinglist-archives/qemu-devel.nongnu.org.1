It's interesting as an experiment, to prove that Windows is riddled with bugs.
(well, and it could serve as starting point to report issue to MS)
But I'd rather Microsoft fix bugs on their side, instead of putting hacks in
QEMU.

PS:
Given it's AMD cpu, I doubt very much that using intel_iommu would be
accepted by Microsoft as valid complaint though.
