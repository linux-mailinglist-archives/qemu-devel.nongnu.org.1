Yes, migration with vhost devices implies that the destination host 
supports at least the same features as the source host. We should 
consider how migration between 2 QEMUs and the destination doesn't 
support a required feature, I guess migration can't happen or the device 
has to be removed and then re-added without that feature.

Yep, I agree!

I see.
