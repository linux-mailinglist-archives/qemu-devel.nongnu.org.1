Great, thanks for finding those. I'll add it to my little "lore"

Being fully honest, at the time I got the impression the situation was
"random person inside RH decided to measure performance of random thing
and upstream maintainer felt pressure to push a fix".

Whether that was the case or not, it doesn't matter now, but we can't
deny that this _has_ generated some headache, just look at how many
issues arose from the introduction of that flag.

My rant aside, I really want to avoid any readers having to think too
much about this flush thing. We're already seeing some confusion when
discussing it with Prasad in the other thread. The code itself and the
git log are more reliable to explain the compat situation IMO.

Yep, that as well.

All good points, but I was talking of something else:

I was just throwing an example of how it could be done differently to
make the point clear that the recv_sync has nothing to do with the ram
flag, that's just implementation detail. I was thinking specifically
about the multifd+postcopy work where we might need syncs but there is
no RAM_FLAGS there.

We don't actually _need_ to sync with the migration thread on the
destination like that. The client could send control information in it's
opaque packet (instead of in the migration thread) or in a completely
separate channel if it wanted. That sync is also not necessary if there
is no dependency around the data being transferred (i.e. mapped-ram just
takes data form the file and writes to guest memory)

To be clear I'm not suggesting we change anything, I'm only trying to
reflect in the docs some level of separation between multifd.c and ram.c
(or whatever else) because we've seen that mixing the two makes the
design less clean. We've already cleared much of the "p->pages" kind of
issues and the packet definition is more versatile after Maciej's work,
but I still think the separation should be more strict (hence all the
"client" talk in this doc).

(I realise I'm hijacking the documentation thread to talk about high
level design, my apologies).
