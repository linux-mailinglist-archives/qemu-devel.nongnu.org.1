Right, and that's also my major purpose of such request to consider both
issues.

If supporting iterators can be easy on top of this, I am thinking whether
we should do this in one shot.  The problem is even if the flag type can be
reused, old/new qemu binaries may not be compatible and may not migrate
well when:

  - The old qemu only supports the downtime optimizations
  - The new qemu supports both downtime + iteration optimizations

IIUC, at least the device threads are currently created only at the end of
migration when switching over for the downtime-only optimization (aka, this
series).  Then it means it won't be compatible with a new QEMU as the
threads there will need to be created before iteration starts to take
iteration data.  So I believe we'll need yet another flag to tune the
behavior of such, one for each optimizations (downtime v.s. data during
iterations).  If they work mostly similarly, I want to avoid two flags.
It'll be chaos for user to see such similar flags and they'll be pretty
confusing.

If possible, I wish we can spend some time looking into that if they're so
close, and if it's low hanging fruit when on top of this series, maybe we
can consider doing that in one shot.

Thanks,
