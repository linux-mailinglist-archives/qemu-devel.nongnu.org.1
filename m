If minor degradations are the price of major improvement, we pay.

Can we make do with just ReST?  Footnotes?  Best if we can control their
placement somehow.

Yes, please, with the understanding that this is *not* a blocker for
getting the new doc generator accepted.

Prior art:

                raise QAPISemError(
                    info, "duplicated '%s' section" % kind)

                raise QAPISemError(
                    self.returns.info,
                    "'Returns' section, but command doesn't return anything=
")

                raise QAPISemError(
                    self.returns.info,
                    "'Returns' section is only valid for commands")

                raise QAPISemError(
                    self.errors.info,
                    "'Errors' section is only valid for commands")

Let's stick to this style.

Good strategy.  I'd appreciate notes on known gaps in the commit message
and/or the cover letter, though.  Don't go out of your way to find gaps,
just make a reasonable effort to write down the ones you already know.
