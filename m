Hi David,

A couple of drive by comments (as we all love those!)

Nice _HID :)

It's static so you should be able to do:
aml_append(dev, aml_name_decl("_STA", aml_int(0xf)));

Probably a silly question but why register no properties?
Is that any different to not registering them?
+ a quick look suggests not all class_init functions
set them.
