I'm not in favor of the change. There was a long discussion in the past, 
but I think the following email is the most comprehensive description of 
my point and includes comparison between the two approaches:
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/2fe8b128-dda1-40af-89ac-e86ba53138f5@daynix.com/

So please check the email and reply it.
