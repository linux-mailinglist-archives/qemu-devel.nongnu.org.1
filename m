why not just require the same: bitmap granularity must be >= target granularity

There is another approach: consider and unaligned part of the request, fit in one cluster (we can always split any request to "aligned" middle part, and at most two small "unligned" parts, each fit into one cluster).

We have two possibilities:

1. the cluster is dirty (marked dirty in the bitmap used by background process)

We can simply ignore this part and rely on background process. This will not affect the convergence of the mirror job.

2. the cluster is clear (i.e. background process, or some previous write already copied it)

In this case, we are safe to do unaligned write, as target cluster must be allocated.

(for bitmap-mode, I don't consider here clusters that are clear from the start, which we shouldn't copy in any case)
