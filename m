Yes.  This series copies the concept from devices to accelerators.  But
since it clearly makes sense for any kind of object, we better move it
to objects instead.  We may not be able to get there in one step,
though.

Yes.

To be precise: we're silently ignoring any -global that fail to apply.

I agree that's wrong.

This is a fundamental QOM design decision.

Not mine, mind.  Moreover, I wasn't there, so my idea on design
rationale may well be off; keep that in mind.

QOM properties are not declared statically, they are created
dynamically.  Aside: this is, in my not particularly humble opinion, a
spectacularly bad idea.

Properties are generally created in instance_init() methods.

Fine print: we later added "class properties", which are created
dynamically within the class, and cloned into the instance before=20
its instance_init() method runs.

Object creation doesn't take arguments, and cannot fail.  An
instance_init() method doesn't take arguments, and cannot fail.

Objects are configured via properties.  Property setters take an
argument (the property value), and can fail.

Any part of object creation + configuration that could fail must be done
in property setters.

Common usage is create object, configure by setting properties, operate.

The state transition between "configuring" and "operating" is important.
For devices, this state transition happens when property "realized" is
set to true.  For user-creatable objects it happens when method
complete() is called.  Both can fail.  For everything else, the
transition is implicit / ad hoc / unclear.

For more on this (and other QOM design issues), see my memo "Dynamic &
heterogeneous machines, initial configuration: problems", in particular
section "Problem 5: QOM lacks a clear life cycle".
Message-ID: <87o7d1i7ky.fsf@pond.sub.org>
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/87o7d1i7ky.fsf@pond.sub.org/

To introspect properties, you need an object.  You can always create one
for that (can't fail).  Properties created outside object initialization
cannot be introspected that way.  This is how qom-list-properties works.

Yes, because they combine object creation, which cannot fail, with
setting properties, which can fail.

Beyond painful.  Possibly infeasible.

Object creation cannot fail.  If we revise this fundamental QOM design
decision, we get to update all call chains leading to object creation.
That's a *massive* undertaking.

Can we solve the problems we have without revising QOM design?

We'd need to delay the actual failure to a point where the design admits
failure.

Here's an idea.  Formalize the life cycle, i.e. make it an explicit
state machine.  Add a "failed" state.  Any error during object creation
makes the object go to "failed".  Going from "failed" to "operating"
fails.  Which is fine, because the design admits failure there.

Thoughts?
