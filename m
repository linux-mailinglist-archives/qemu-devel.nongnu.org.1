Thanks!  I don’t mind restructuring, I just wanted to be verbose on 
what’s happening.  Honestly, I’m also not 100 % sure about my reasoning, 
which is why I put a lot of indefinite fluff in there, i.e. purposefully 
was not clear.

I wonder what exactly you find to be the problem with it, though? Too 
much fluff, too much detail, weird sentence structure?

It’s before vhost_reset_device(), not virtio_reset() (all of this is in 
virtio_reset()).  Also, the “`virtio_set_status()` for vhost devices” 
sounds a bit strange and too detail-less to me; (A) it makes it sound a 
bit like it’d be only called for vhost devices (easily solvable by 
moving “for vhost devices” back after ”false”), and (B) I would like to 
have the detail in there how vhost_started is cleared by the set_status 
call, because it doesn’t seem obvious to me.  Also, I find the “never 
reached during a reset” strangely abstract; we can be very concrete 
here, so why not be?

Maybe

When a vhost device is reset, we want `virtio_reset()` to call 
`vhost_reset_device()`.  However, `virtio_reset()` begins with 
`virtio_set_status(vdev, 0)`, which, for vhost devices, will end up in 
`vhost_dev_stop()`, clearing `vhost_started`.  This makes the subsequent 
`vhost_reset_device()` call unreachable.

I find this unclear on how vhost_dev_start()/stop() indicate what 
vhost_started means (it’s because they set/clear it).  I cannot stand 
behind “reset must happen if there is no processing request”, because I 
don’t know for sure.  I just feel like it makes more sense this way, 
hence me saying “probably”.  I miss context to “it stops the backend”, I 
would like to be clear that it’s through virtio_set_status(0) that the 
back-end is stopped.  I find it important to be concrete here because I 
asked myself whether e could pull vhost_reset_device() up before 
virtio_set_status(0), and this paragraph is intended to convey that that 
would be wrong; I want to be clear that the concrete call order in that 
function makes sense to me.

I also miss a connection to why this paragraph is focussing on 
vhost_started now.  Maybe I’m a bit slow at making connections, but in 
this rephrased version, it is not 100 % clear that vhost_started is a 
condition for vhost_reset_device() (unless one looks at the code 
simultaneously), so its importance and why we need to know what it does 
isn’t clear here.  The very start of the original message however did 
stress that the vhost_started condition seems wrong, so it’s clear why 
it’s important at this point.

So maybe

Requiring `vhost_started` as a precondition for `vhost_reset_device()` 
is also semantically questionable: While undocumented, it being 
set/cleared by `vhost_dev_{start,stop}()` indicates that it shows 
whether there is a vhost back-end, and whether that back-end is running 
and processing virtio requests. The latter should not be a condition for 
doing a reset, on the contrary: A reset should preferably happen when 
the back-end is stopped.  Thus, the order that we have in 
`virtio_reset()` (stop the back-end via `virtio_set_status(vdev, 0)`, 
then reset it) makes perfect sense, but checking `vhost_started` does not.

This seems incorrect: First, we decidedly no longer check that the 
device is running, that was the point of the previous paragraph. Second, 
no such check has been introduced by commit 95e1019a4a9. That commit 
just introduced a check of `k->get_vhost != NULL`, i.e. whether this 
could even theoretically be a vhost device.

So I’d just keep the final paragraph as-is from the original patch. It 
isn’t much longer, just quotes more code.
