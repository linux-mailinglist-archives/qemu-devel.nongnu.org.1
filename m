Hi Fabiano,

Your current refactoring assumes that compression ops and multifd
socket ops are mutually exclusive. Both of them need to implement the
entire MultiFDMethods interface. I think this works fine for now. Once
we introduce multifd zero page checking and we add a new interface for
that, we are adding a new method zero_page_detect() on the
MultiFDMethods interface. If we do that, zero_page_detect() needs to
be implemented in multifd_socket_ops and it also needs to be
implemented in zlib and zstd. On top of that, if we add an accelerator
to offload zero_page_detect(), that accelerator configuration can
co-exist with compression or socket. That makes things quite
complicated in my opinion.

Can we create an instance of MultiFDMethods at runtime and fill each
method depending on the configuration? If methods are not filled, we
fallback to fill it with the default implementation (like what
socket.c provides) For instance, if zstd is enabled and zero page
checking using CPU, the interface will be filled with all the
functions zstd currently implements and since zstd doesn't implement
zero_page_detect(), we will fallback to fill zero_page_detect() with
the default multifd zero page checking implementation.
