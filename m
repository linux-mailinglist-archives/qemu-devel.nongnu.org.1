Only if you stop reading before the last paragraph :)

I agree with Daniel that trying to legislate exceptions is not going to
work.  Instead, we put in this:

    This policy may evolve as AI tools mature and the legal situation is
    clarifed. In the meanwhile, requests for exceptions to this policy will=
 be
    evaluated by the QEMU project on a case by case basis. To be granted an
    exception, a contributor will need to demonstrate clarity of the licens=
e and
    copyright status for the tool's output in relation to its training mode=
l and
    code, to the satisfaction of the project maintainers.

Last paragraph, i.e. a fairly prominent spot.

If you can make a convinving case that the tool's output is not
copyrightable, I like your chances of being granted an exception.

As always, if you think doc text is insufficiently clear, let's work on
improving it.
