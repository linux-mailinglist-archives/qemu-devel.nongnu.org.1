So one problem with this is that it immediately puts all of TCG onto
the security boundary with the VM. We don't claim any kind of security
or can't-escape guarantees for TCG, and it's a lot of code, some of
which is old and some of which wasn't written with security as
a top-of-mind concern.

Our approach to these instructions with KVM on Arm is to say "don't
do those in the guest to MMIO regions". Most sensible guest code
doesn't do weird instruction forms for device accesses, and the
performance is going to be bad anyway if you need to fully emulate them.
(This includes in the past that Windows got fixed to not do this
kind of insn to a device in at least one case.)

It's not really a good idea to use virtio-vga in an Arm VM,
because it requires FEAT_S2FWB in the host CPU to make it
work properly, and not every CPU has that, at least in the
KVM world. So you need to use virtio-gpu anyhow.
