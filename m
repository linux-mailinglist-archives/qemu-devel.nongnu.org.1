To expand on this...

Bear in mind that when stuff breaks, users file bugs, and the QEMU
maintainers are on the receiving end of user demands to investigate
and fix the problem.

These kind of issues have the potential to be very hard to debug
and diagnose. Maintainer time is precious, which is why we're
conservative at making decisions that expose us to potential long
term negative consequences / increased workload. Compiling with
flags that were known to be incompatible with our code historically
is a reasonable thing to reject. It should not be unexpected that
when a request to change this has a higher burden of proof that
other proposals.

IMHO we need to have confidence not only in the current state of the code,
but also that we're not going to accidentally regresss it in the future.
This is what the gcc_struct attribute gives us confidence in.

If we can do an assert with a 'sizeof' check, that would give us similar,
but I presume any sizeof checks need to be manually written to specify
the expected size ? A manual check for pahole output by comparison only
tells us about the current point in time of QEMU code.

As an alternative is it practical for us to eliminate all bitfields
from our structs ? IIUC, we already have the preference that we use
the 'BIT(n)' and 'BIT_ULL(n)' macros for accessing bits from full
sized int32/int64 fields which avoids the semantic layout problems.

With regards,
Daniel
