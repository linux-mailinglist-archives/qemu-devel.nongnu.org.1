I see.

Maybe there's an argument for supporting arch=ISA_STR in its entirely instead of
cherry-picking what we want.

In the end the discussion you're prompting here is whether do we want/need to
implement and support an alternative way of enabling extensions, and in this
case one that is more compatible with the rest of the SW stack we use in the
RISC-V land.

The implementation per se isn't the hard part: the hard part is how to deal
with the upkeep of supporting both the ISA_STR and our current extension
enable/disable code in the long run. I'm not entirely sure also whether we can
use this new arch=ISA_STR as just a superficial layer to do what we already
do or if this would require additional changes in QMP and what not. Drew,
care to comment?
