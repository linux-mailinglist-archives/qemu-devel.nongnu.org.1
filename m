At least for the main channel probably yes.  I think Dan has had the idea
of adding the buffering layer over iochannels, then replace qemufiles with
that.  Multifd channels looks ok so far to use as raw channels.

On the locked_vm part: probably yes, we'd better try to avoid using page
pinning if possible. It just looks like it becomes a more important
scenario nowadays to put VMs into containers, it means then such feature
may not be always usable there.

For the rest: I really don't know much on iouring, but I remember it can be
fast normally only in a poll model with interrupt-less context?  Not sure
whether it suites here for us, as I guess we should avoid consuming cpu
resourcess with no good reason, and polling for perf falls into that
category, I think.  Even without it, kubevirt now already has issue on
multifd eating cpus, and people observe multifd threads causing vcpu
threads to be throttled, interrupting guest workloads; they're currently
put in the same container.  I also not sure how much it'll help comparing
to when we have the multi-threading ready.  I suspect not that much.
