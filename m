"perf" would cover 4) and "compat" will cover 1). However neither of 
them will cover 2) because an enum is not enough to know about all 
hosts. I presented a design that will cover 2) in:
https://lore.kernel.org/r/2da4ebcd-2058-49c3-a4ec-8e60536e5cbb@daynix.com

I also want to point out that "perf" should be rather named like 
"nomigrate". In general, a program should expose a functional 
requirement on the interface. It can then do its best to achieve high 
performance under that requirement.

When it is named nomigrate, it is obvious that migration does not work.

It is not about whether the user is knowledgeable or not, but it is 
about what the user wants. Migration is mandatory for a user who runs 
multi-tenant platforms, but it doesn't really matter for desktop users. 
Which are more knowledgeable? Personally, I want to have higher 
expectation for users running multi-tenant platforms, but it all depends.

You asked for the next step in another email. My suggestion is to 
satisfy 1) first because it is the easiest and safest. In particular, I 
suggest disabling all platform-dependent features by default to satisfy 
1). Combined with an existing option, -only-migratable, users will get 
the maximum assurance of migratability.

4) is the second easiest to implement, but the design of 4) will depend 
on whether we will satisfy 2) or 3). In the email I cited earlier, I 
suggested an option -use-platform to specify the expectation on the 
platform. If it is ever to be implemented, that option can take a 
special value, "host" to tell QEMU that it can use any features it finds 
on the current host.
