"Big" method is probably the issue there. If it's not possible to follow 
control flow in a given function, it's a strong hint there is a problem 
with its size, independently of any standard. And even though 
goto_cleanup is a legit pattern in C, I still don't get the argument 
about declaring variable far from their definition point in this case.
It seems that we are trying to solve the consequence without really 
understanding the root cause issue.

That's right, but humanly enforced coding standard are usually a waste 
of time for everyone (reviewers and developers).

How many messages and exchanges on the mailing list could we save by 
using something like clang-format on the codebase, and force it to be 
"clean" as part of the CI? There would be no more discussion, as there 
would be only one single and objective source of truth.
