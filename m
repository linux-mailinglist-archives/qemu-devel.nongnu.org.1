I've done a bit of digging and I agree things are quite messy. Here are
my discoveries:

The debug option and the code for triggers was added in these commits:

c9711bd778 target/riscv: cpu: Enable native debug feature
38b4e781a4 target/riscv: machine: Add debug state description
b6092544fc target/riscv: csr: Hook debug CSR read/write
1acdb3b013 target/riscv: cpu: Add a config option for native debug
95799e36c1 target/riscv: Add initial support for the Sdtrig extension

In March 2022 - since the commit refers to the Sdtrig extension name
and from the date this was an implementation not of the ratified 0.13
debug spec (which did not have Sdtrig as a separate extension) but
rather a version of the in development 1.0 debug spec.

It's not trivial to tell if it's closer to the ratified 0.13 version or
the (hopefully soon to be frozen) 1.0 version.

As the only part of the debug specification to be implemented is the
triggers then effectively the debug option is x-sdtrig.

I don't think there is any way for code running on the machine to
identify what version of the debug is implemented - the appropriate
register is only available for external debug. Once 1.0 is frozen then
the presence of Sdtrig isa string would indicate 1.0 trigger support is
available.

According to JIRA - https://jira.riscv.org/browse/RVS-981 the debug
specification should freeze this month.

How about considering this as a solution:

- Add a new x-sdtrig option that defaults to false
- Deprecate debug option - but retain it with default on
- Add warning if triggers are used and x-sdtrig is not enabled
- Update the trigger implementation to match frozen spec

There is potentially a chance that some use cases will be broken but I
don't think triggers are being widely use - the SBI support only just
got merged:
https://github.com/riscv-software-src/opensbi/commit/97f234f15c9657c6ec69fa=
6ed745be8107bf6ae2

Hope this is helpful,

Rob
