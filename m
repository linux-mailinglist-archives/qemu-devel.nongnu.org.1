Converting a 4.4 GiB Windows 10 image to qcow2. It was mentioned in v1 and v2,
are you saying they did not reach your inbox?

qemu-img invokes buffer_is_zero in a fairly tight loop. Let us know if you
need numbers how much the out-of-line version loses.

Okay, but that does not make it necessary to move byte checks out of line.
I was preparing a rebase that does not expose the function pointer to the
inline wrapper. I was completely unaware that you're taking over the patchset.
