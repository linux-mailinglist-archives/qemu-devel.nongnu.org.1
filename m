I understand your point, but to the opposite of registers, I think we 
should refrain from exposing all this.
For now, we can just use the current AS.

Later, we could consider to add a new architecture specific parameter 
for that need (being a union, with fields per base architecture). So 
people writing architecture specific plugins can have a solution.

AddressSpace as = {.arm = ADDRESS_SPACE_ARM_SECURE};
qemu_plugin_read_memory_hwaddr_as(addr, data, as);

qemu_plugin_insn_haddr returns directly a pointer to instruction in 
(host) memory, which is different from hwaddr, thus the void* signature.
Name is pretty confusing though, qemu_plugin_insn_ptr could have been a 
better name.
