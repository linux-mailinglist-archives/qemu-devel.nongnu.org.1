Alex, thanks for chiming in! By "single binary", I assume you mean user
space emulation? In that case, could you elaborate whether and how it's
a concern related to MCD? Maybe I'm missing something here. MCD is
specifically designed for debugging multi-core SoCs and therefore
currently only supported in system emulation. For user-space debugging,
I don't see any reason why not to use GDB's remote serial protocol.

Like the gdbstub, the MCD implementation does not have any
target-specific dependencies. This is also a change compared to the last
patch set and something I wanted to point out with

But, again, maybe I'm missing something.

Even though MCD is a very stable API (developed in 2008, functions
haven't changed since then), as you've already pointed out, it's bold to
assume that it will never change in the future. For that reason, MCD
provides the mcd_initialize_f function which can be used to communicate
the requested and implemented API versions. As long as that function
stays serializable over the RPC layer, evolution should be possible.

If I understand you correctly, when QAPI-MCD runs on a separate socket
without using a monitor, it's still coupled to the monitor code
internally? Does this have an influence on the either the usage of a
monitor or the MCD interface or is it rather an implementation detail?
