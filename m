Thanks for clarifying. Is this described somewhere in the docs? The file 
formats are mentioned but the protocol and their relation to formats is 
not clearly described. Maybe it's worth clarifying that in the docs.

I'm still not sure I completely get this but vvfat is not backed by a raw 
image but a host directory so why is the raw file format comes into play 
here at all? Shouldn't this always assume that for fat: the format is 
vvfat (or no format) and not a raw file? Then size property then would 
also work as expected.

Does any format make sense for fat: at all considering the above that it 
does not access an image file with a format but a host directory? So maybe 
using and defaulting to format=raw is not quite right here?

It would work if it would not default to format=raw for fat: which seems 
to make more sense to me than the current default but I don't know if it's 
easy or possible to change that.

In that case maybe it's enough to give a warning in case we detect the 
wrong usage and point users to use the right way to specify size instead 
of adding another fat-size, fs-size or mbr-size option for this? 
Considering that format=vvfat,size=256M works I think either changing the 
default format for fat: or giving an error if fat: and size is specified 
without format=vvfat would solve this without a new option.
