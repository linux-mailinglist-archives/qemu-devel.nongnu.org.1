That is a technical limitation, but the problem here is bigger than
just the lack of qdev. It is a conceptual one - where a device is
implemented, its behaviour is determined exclusively by the QEMU
code. There are some rare exceptions, like host PCI device assignment
where functionality is partly in the host hardware, or external
device backends where impl is offloaded to an external process, but
most pure QEMU impls are able to be made always migratable and compat
can be easily ensured long term via machine types props.

With backends, alot of behaviour is offloaded to either the host
OS, or to external libraries or services. Certain narrow configs
may be able to transfer state, but there will always be configs
were state transfer is impossible. There can be no coarse rule
that a backend is migratable or not - it will usually be highly
dependent on the particular configuration choices of the backend
in use.  Machine types props can't magically make all backend
config scenarios migratable. We need to be able to interrogate
backends at the time migration is required.

We shouldn't need to list devices in every scenario. We need to focus on
the internal API design. We need to have suitable APIs exposed by backends
to allow us to query migratability and process vmstate a mere property
'backend-transfer' is insufficient, whether set by QEMU code, or set by
the mgmt app.

If we have proper APIs each device should be able to query whether its
backend can be transferred, and so "do the right thing" if backend
transfer is requested by migration. The ability to list devices in the
migrate command is only needed to be able to exclude some backends if
the purpose of migration is to change a backend

With regards,
Daniel
