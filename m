Hi! I didn't notice, that the series was finally merged.

About the APIs, I think, of course we should deprecate block-job-* API, because we already have jobs which are not block-jobs, so we can't deprecate job-* API.

So I suggest a plan:

1. Add job-change command simply in block-core.json, as a simple copy of block-job-change, to not care with resolving inclusion loops. (ha we could simply name our block-job-change to be job-change and place it in block-core.json, but now is too late)

2. Support changing speed in a new job-chage command. (or both in block-job-change and job-change, keeping them equal)

3. Deprecate block-job-* APIs

4. Wait 3 releases

5. Drop block-job-* APIs

6. Move all job-related stuff to job.json, drop `{ 'include': 'job.json' }` from block-core.json, and instead include block-core.json into job.json

If it's OK, I can go through the steps.
