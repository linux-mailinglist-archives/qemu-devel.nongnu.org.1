As explained, that addition was wrong, because migrate_multifd() should
always return the user option only.  Again, you can add another helper.

I'll post a version to clean it up, either we go with Fabiano's, or mine,
or a 3rd option.  We shouldn't pile up more condition check there.  It's
growing into something not maintainable.

Yes they're relevant, but I think we can cleanup the whole thing and it's
not that complicated, IMHO.  We'll see.

I assume you're working on the test cases, I hope this won't block you from
continuing your work on this series.

As mentioned above, I think we need to clean this up before moving on,
unfortunately.  And I hope things settle already before you have the test
cases ready.  I appreciate you add the test cases for multifd+postcopy.
That's very important.  Before that you can keep your patch as-is, and
leave that part for us to figure out.  Feel free to chime in anytime as
well.

So we talked about this in our meeting, but still just to keep it a record
so whoever work on migration can reference: we do require test cases and
it's not separate effort.  We request both test cases and docs to present
before mering a feature, unless there's good reason to not to.

E.g. multifd doesn't yet have doc, so doc is not required for this work
yet, however test cases are.

Another outlier is VFIO+multifd cannot easily add test case because CI
normally doesn't have available hardware environment.  However does should
apply there to be required at least from migration POV.

Thanks,
