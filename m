You're right.  However the problem is we have pretty good grasp of the
major DMA target here (guest mem), so what I feel like is some missing work
in this area, that we're not sure what this new parameter is applying to.

It's not the case where we know "OK we have a million use case of RAM, and
we're 100% sure we want to make them all fd-based, and we introduce this
flag simply because adding this to each 1-million will take years and
thousands LOC changes".

The new parameter is cheap to paper over the question being raised here,
but it definitely adds not only ambiguity (when it conflicts with -object)
and that we'll need to maintain its compatibility for all RAMs that we have
totally no idea what can be implied underneath for whatever QEMU cmdline
that can be specified.

IMHO that, OTOH, justifies that there may need some further study to
justify this parameter alone.  For example, if it's only the vRAM that is
missing, we may at least want to have a parameter nailing down to vRAM
behavior rather than affecting anything, so as to at least avoid collision
on -object parameters.

Thanks,
