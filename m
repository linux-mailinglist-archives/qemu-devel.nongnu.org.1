This problem cannot be reproduced after 
7c1f51bf38 ("nbd/server: Fix drained_poll to wake coroutine in right AioContext") 
that avoids repeatedly waking up the same coroutine.

Invoking g_main_loop_run() in the coroutine will cause that 
event completion callback function qio_channel_restart_read() is called repeatedly, 
but the coroutine is woken up only once.

The key modifications are as follows:

static void qio_channel_restart_read(void *opaque)
{
    QIOChannel *ioc = opaque;
-   Coroutine *co = ioc->read_coroutine;
+   Coroutine *co = qatomic_xchg(&ioc->read_coroutine, NULL);
+
+   if (!co) {
+       return;
+   }

    /* Assert that aio_co_wake() reenters the coroutine directly */
    assert(qemu_get_current_aio_context() ==
           qemu_coroutine_get_aio_context(co));
    aio_co_wake(co);
}

The root cause is that poll() is invoked in coroutine context.
