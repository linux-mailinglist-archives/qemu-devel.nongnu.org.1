I see, at least for HPETTimer array, I need to prepare all of them in
instance_init()...

...in realize(), also need to handle the "timers" property to enable
the timers that property requires.

make sense, thanks!

Sorry, I'm not familiar enough with this piece...I have the question
because PinInit doc said "you will need a suitable memory location that
can hold a T. This can be KBox<T>, Arc<T>, UniqueArc<T> or even the
stack (see stack_pin_init!)."

I see that the core point is ensuring that structures cannot be moved.
Given that object_new() on the C side ensures that the allocated object
will not be moved, Rust side does not need to worry about pinning, correct?

Vec seems to lack proper vmstate support. I understand that we need to
modify VMSTATE_STRUCT_VARRAY_POINTER_* to introduce a variant for Vec.

Since the array support is already available, I chose to use an array
instead (although vmstate is disabled for now).

Good idea, yes, will do.

Thanks,
