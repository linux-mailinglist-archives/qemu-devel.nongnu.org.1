Hello,

In addition to my previous mail describing the issue on different
Ubuntu releases,

I went further by testing directly qemu upstream at HEAD
(baa79455fa92984ff0f4b9ae94bed66823177a27)

As the start version for the migration, I take quite recent release
v10.0.x to make the version gap smaller.

I can reproduce the following migration failures:

v10.0.2 -> HEAD:
error: operation failed: guest CPU doesn't match specification:
missing features: pdcm,arch-capabilities

v10.0.3 -> HEAD:
error: operation failed: guest CPU doesn't match specification:
missing features: pdcm
The error arch-capabilities is no longer present because v10.0.3 also
has [2] like HEAD.

If I revert the two commits [1] and [2] in HEAD, the migration works fine:

v10.0.2 -> HEAD (+reverts):
OK

[1] Revert "i386/cpu: Move adjustment of CPUID_EXT_PDCM before
feature_dependencies[] check"
    This reverts commit e68ec2980901c8e7f948f3305770962806c53f0b.

[2] Revert "target/i386: do not expose ARCH_CAPABILITIES on AMD CPU"
    This reverts commit d3a24134e37d57abd3e7445842cda2717f49e96d.

Since this issue is blocking us for the Ubuntu 25.10 release, can you
please provide
feedback on the best path going forward ?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I was unsure if this would be better sent to lib=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; issue is somewhere between libvirt modelling CPU=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; behaving differently. I did not want to double p=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the people are on both lists - since the switch =

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is qemu 10.0 &lt;-&gt; 10.1 let me start here. I=
 beg your pardon for not yet<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; having all the answers, I&#39;m sure I could fin=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I also wanted to report early for your awareness=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; # Problem<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What I found when testing migrations in Ubuntu w=
ith qemu 10.1-rc1 was:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 error: operation failed: guest CPU =
doesn&#39;t match specification:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; missing features: pdcm<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is behaving the same with libvirt 11.4 or t=
he more recent 11.6.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But switching back to qemu 10.0 confirmed that t=
his behavior is new<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with qemu 10.1-rc.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Without yet having any hard evidence against the=
m I found a few pdcm<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; related commits between 10.0 and 10.1-rc1:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 7ff24fb65 i386/tdx: Don&#39;t mask =

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; # Caveat<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My test environment is in LXD system containers,=
 that gives me issues<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the power management detection<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 libvirtd[406]: error from service: =
GDBus.Error:System.Error.EROFS:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Read-only file system<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 libvirtd[406]: Failed to get host p=
ower management capabilities<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; That&#39;s harmless.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Yeah, it always was for me - thanks for confirming.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And the resulting host-model on a=C2=A0 rather o=
ld test server will therefore have:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 &lt;cpu mode=3D&#39;custom&#39; mat=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 &lt;model fallback=3D&#39;fo=
rbid&#39;&gt;Haswell-noTSX-IBRS&lt;/model&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 &lt;vendor&gt;Intel&lt;/vend=
or&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 &lt;feature policy=3D&#39;re=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But that was fine in the past, and the behavior =
started to break<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; save/restore or migrations just now with the new=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m soon overwhelmed by meetings for the res=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; curious if one has a suggestion about what to lo=
ok at next for<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; debugging or a theory about what might go wrong.=
 If nothing else comes<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; up I&#39;ll try to set up a bisect run tomorrow.=
<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, git bisect is what I&#39;d start with.<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Which is odd as it should only add a warning right?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; No, that commit message is misleading.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; IIUC mark_unavailable_features() actively blocks usage of th=
e feature,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; so it is a functional change, not merely a emitting warning.=
<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It makes me wonder if that commit was actually intended to b=
lock the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; feature or not, vs merely warning ?=C2=A0 CC&#39;ing those i=

&gt; &gt; &gt; commit.<br>
&gt; &gt; We can revert the commit.=C2=A0 I&#39;ll send the revert to Stefa=
n and let him<br>
&gt; &gt; decide whether to include it in 10.1-rc4 or delay to 10.2 and 10.=
1.1.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks Paolo for considering that.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; My steps to reproduce seemed really clear and are 100% reproducible<br=
>
&gt; for me, but no one so far said &quot;yeah they see it too&quot;, so I&=
#39;m getting<br>
&gt; unsure if it was not tried by anyone else or if there is more to it<br=
>
&gt; than we yet know.<br>
&gt; Further I tested more with the commit reverted, and found that at<br>
&gt; least cross version migrations (9.2 -&gt; 10.1) still have issues that=
<br>
&gt; seem related - complaining about pdcm as missing feature.<br>
&gt; But that was in a log of a test system that went away and ... you know=
<br>
&gt; how these things can sometimes be, that new result is not yet very<br>
&gt; reliable.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I intended to check the following matrix more deeply again with and<br=
>
&gt; without the reverted change and then come back to this thread:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; #1 Compare platforms<br>
&gt; - Migrating between non containerized hosts to verify if they are<br>
&gt; affected as well<br>
&gt; - Power management explicitly switched off/on (vs the auto detect of<b=
r>
&gt; host-model) in the guest XML<br>
&gt; #2 Retest the different Use-cases I&#39;ve seen this pop up<br>
&gt; - 10.1 managed save (broken unless reverting the commit that was ident=
ified)<br>
&gt; - 9.2 -&gt; 10.1 migration (seems broken even with the revert)<br>
<br>
I need to come back to this aspect of it - the cross release or cross<br>
qemu version migrations.<br>
<br>
Hector (on CC) helps me on that now - sadly we were able to confirm<br>
that migrations from older qemu versions no longer work.<br>
Yep 10.1 is released by now so it might end up as &quot;The problem is what=
<br>
happens when we detect after we have done a release that something has<br>
gone wrong&quot; from [2].<br>
But I still can&#39;t believe only we see this and therefore for now want<b=
r>
to believe I messed up on our side when merging 10.1 :-)<br>
<br>
For now this is a call if others have also seen any older release<br>
migrating to 10.1 to throw:<br>
=C2=A0 error: operation failed: guest CPU doesn&#39;t match specification:<=
br>
missing features: pdcm,arch-capabilities<br>
<br>
Hector will later today reply here with a summary of what we found so<br>
far, to provide you a more complete picture to think about, without<br>
having to read through all the messy interim steps in the Ubuntu bug.<br>
