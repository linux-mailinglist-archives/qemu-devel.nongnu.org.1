I understand the concern.
However, one argument may be that QAPI json, as perfect as we could 
expect they are, are simply known and used inside QEMU right now, which 
is written in C at the moment.
Even if that assumption should change, I'm pretty sure we can create 
functions named in the same way in C, python, Go, Rust or any other 
languages we would like to generate code for.
It's not like if we started using complex expressions that only works in 
nightly version of Rust.

Correct if I'm wrong, but it was said in previous threads that those 
json are simply used and consumed by QEMU itself, and not by any 
external projects.
I would be prudent to call this a public API definition, when it's just 
a DSL for an ad-hoc code generator internal to QEMU.

Overall, and I would like to state it again, I'm really open to any 
solution to get rid of TARGET_* compile time defines in QAPI json.
And I appreciate the solution you posted as well.

For now, it's blocking the single binary work, because any file pulling 
QAPI definitions is tainted with TARGET_* defines, so we are blocked 
waiting for them to be removed upstream, before being able to post a 
series touching those files.

I hope we can get a clear answer from QAPI maintainers, so you or I can 
take ownership of this and finish the work. From the previous thread, I 
thought (and I may be wrong) that Markus was more enclined to the 
current solution, but it was not entirely clear for me to be honest.
Let's hope that having both approaches implemented will give a good 
insight of where things should go.

Thanks,
Pierrick
