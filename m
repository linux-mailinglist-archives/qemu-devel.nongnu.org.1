[this is an early RFC, not for merge, but to collect initial feedbacks]

Background
==========

Nowadays, live migration heavily depends on threads. For example, most of
the major features that will be used nowadays in live migration (multifd,
postcopy, mapped-ram, vfio, etc.) all work with threads internally.

But still, from time to time, we'll see some coroutines floating around the
migration context.  The major one is precopy's loadvm, which is internally
a coroutine.  It is still a critical path that any live migration depends on.

A mixture of using both coroutines and threads is prone to issues.  Some
examples can refer to commit e65cec5e5d ("migration/ram: Yield periodically
to the main loop") or commit 7afbdada7e ("migration/postcopy: ensure
preempt channel is ready before loading states").

Overview
========

This series tries to move migration further into the thread-based model, by
allowing the loadvm process to happen in a thread rather than in the main
thread with a coroutine.

Luckily, since the qio channel code is always ready for both cases, IO
paths should all be fine.

Note that loadvm for postcopy already happens in a ram load thread which is
separate.  However, RAM is just the simple case here, even it has its own
challenges (on atomically update of the pgtables), its complexity lies in
the kernel.

For precopy, loadvm has quite a few operations that will need BQL.  The
question is we can't take BQL for the whole process of loadvm, because
that'll block the main thread from executions (e.g. QMP hangs).  Here, the
finer granule we can push BQL the better.  This series so far chose
somewhere in the middle, by taking BQL on majorly these two places:

  - CPU synchronizations
  - Device START/FULL sections

After this series applied, most of the rest loadvm path will run without
BQL anymore.  There is a more detailed discussion / todo in the commit
message of patch "migration: Thread-ify precopy vmstate load process"
explaning how to further split the BQL critical sections.

I was trying to split the patches into smaller ones if possible, but it's
still quite challenging so there's one major patch that does the work.

After the series applied, the only leftover pieces in migration/ that would
use a coroutine is snapshot save/load/delete jobs.

Tests
=====

Default CI passes.

RDMA unit tests pass as usual. I also tried out cancellation / failure
tests over RDMA channels, making sure nothing is stuck.

I also roughly measured how long it takes to run the whole 80+ migration
qtest suite, and see no measurable difference before / after this series.

Risks
=====

This series has the risk of breaking things.  I would be surprised if it
didn't..

I confess I didn't test anything on COLO but only from code observations
and analysis.  COLO maintainers: could you add some unit tests to QEMU's
qtests?

The current way of taking BQL during FULL section load may cause issues, it
means when the IOs are unstable we could be waiting for IO (in the new
migration incoming thread) with BQL held.  This is low possibility, though,
only happens when the network halts during flushing the device states.
However still possible.  One solution is to further breakdown the BQL
critical sections to smaller sections, as mentioned in TODO.

Anything more than welcomed: suggestions, questions, objections, tests..

Todo
====

- Test COLO?
- Finer grained BQL breakdown
- More..
