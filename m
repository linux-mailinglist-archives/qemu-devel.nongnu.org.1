I really appreciate you took the time to share that and your experience 
on the topic. The "exclusion" based approach you use is definitely a 
good option in case I get notified with too many series.

I tend to see series as an atomic change, expecting them to be pulled as 
a whole. Thus, I expect, maybe wrongly, that isolated doc patches will 
be pulled with the concerned series.

For my workflow, I use a single qemu-devel folder, with a few additional 
mechanics to follow threads:
- emails where I'm a direct cc/to are starred (Imap \Flagged keyword)
- use tags (imap keywords) for series: to review, personal, to follow up
- keep cover letter unread as long as there is an action to do on this 
thread
- mark as read all the rest so it can disappear quickly

Order of series in my client are:
[tag - to review]
[tag - personal (my series)]
[tag - follow up (was reviewed or is interesting)]
[untagged series where I'm a direct cc/to]
[all the rest]

This way, top series are the one followed, and all the bottom ones are 
the new ones, and I can focus on the "starred" ones to identify quickly 
content that concerns me.

 From this, I just expect to see more starred threads, and I can easily 
see what concerns me (doc oriented series) or not (partial doc as part 
of the series), and tag the series accordingly.

We'll see in two months how this opinion changed :)

Thanks,
Pierrick
