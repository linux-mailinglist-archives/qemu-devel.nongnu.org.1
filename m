possibly. possibly not. I don't know how much value it adds to split it 
up as one can see a logical change together in the message and diff. 
"label" to "data" essentially. splitting it splits the logical name 
change across commits and imho would be harder as a reader of history.

splitting the name change and the merging of the two functions seems a 
little complex to coordinate as I would need some intermediate names. 
they seem to be part of the same change. if I changed it to varargs 
without naming consistent with my thinking it makes less sense to me.

yes I am aware of what it is. sometimes referred to as constant islands. 
but you could also consider it as switching between .text and .data or 
maybe interleaved .sdata or "small data". and yes one needs also to be 
careful about pads. one could try to put host instruction text into them 
and use them as a piece of an emulator break out if you can find out how 
to modify the stack pointer to jump to these "constants" in RX pages.

I can revise the text. I see it as a reified text constant as the 
primary data with a label (pointer not object) and a relocation embedded 
inside the constant data object for performance. in a more conventional 
code generator one would create a TCGLabel and TCGReloc. and yes you are 
right. it's not really .data section. I am just curious about 
reconciling concepts between binary translators and more traditional 
compilers. but ideally without a loss in performance.

I actually have a VM in mind that has a constant stream with it's own 
counter that branches called IB (immediate base). IB is set in call 
procedure and we pack a vector into the link register with the relative 
offset of the program counter and immediate base register (i32,i32) 
gives call +/-2GiB reach. link register no longer has absolute address. 
and there is a branch instruction for the constant stream. return needs 
two immediate offsets displaced from the text and constant entry points 
to compute the return address.

I have a sketch for a design that does this. and constants don't come 
over the same memory port as data as it has dedicated fetch bandwidth 
with a constant prefetcher. I could build a front-end and back-end for 
it when I get time. a CPU with some GPU concepts but no fixed function 
rasterizer. also relocs are easier because a RISC using this gets more 
conventional aligned PC-relative relocs of whole words. so the linker 
would be a little faster. constants are all bonded register slot sized 
in the instruction form instead of a special immediate form. it needs 
extra bypassing for "large immediate" but the latency can be covered by 
adding pipeline stages. constant branch predictor in parallel up front.

TCGPoolData would be okay and I thought about that. the reason against 
was that it competed with TCGPool. but in some senses that might be the 
right name because it is a data constant in the pool. but we embed the 
relocation and label (as pointer) without a full TCGLabel and TCGReloc.

it's pretty good code on SysV because it goes via registers except for 
perhaps new_pool_l8 which will spill to stack and get copied unless the 
inliner can eliminate the copies. maybe windows has bad varargs. but I 
like the style better than deeper layers of wrapper functions. they 
should fix the compiler so that it produces better code.

btw I didn't run through a benchmark suite to check for performance 
regressions because I don't have one in the rig. it was more of a code 
comprehension comment expressed as a patch. it could be merged if it 
adds to the code comprehension without affecting performance.

I will refresh.
