At this point, it seems more natural to expose exactly the same 
information, instead of trying to see "potential" impact of exposing 
more. I just feel like we'll open a pandora box, and it will take a long 
time to converge anywhere.

The initial motivation is just to remove per target code in QAPI 
generated code, and not to trigger a whole refactoring in several projects.

If we expose exactly the same schema, there is no need to change 
anything. The only impact is on modifying the .json, to add new *_if 
clauses, targetting runtime, instead of compile time.

When posting my series, I was not aware of all the introspection aspect, 
and simply was focused on qemu monitor commands which are registered, so 
thanks for bringing this.

After looking at schema introspection code, I think it will not be hard 
to expose parts based on a runtime check.

It's something we might talk about later for sure.
On this thread, if possible, I would like to avoid starting talking 
about the new binary, new command line, new monitor schema, as they are 
a different topic, and I'm sure people will have a lot of different 
opinions, which won't solve the current issue of compiling QAPI 
generated code only once.
