Maybe it worked with older MacOS X releases but broke around the same time 
when commit 5588840ff77800 was needed to fix the cocoa UI? Maybe gtk needs 
a similar fix or whatever cocoa was changed to use since somewhere in gtk 
or QEMU?

Also I find it strange to require UI backends to NULL init a global. If 
the cocoa UI is the only one that needs it could that also set it instead 
of doing it in /system? That would also confine macOS specific code to 
cocoa.m and the other UIs would not need any change that way.
