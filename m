I checked what FW is doing on a QEMU ast2500-evb machine :
  
     U-Boot 2019.04-v00.04.12 (Sep 29 2022 - 10:40:37 +0000)

It seems that the R_DMA_LEN register is set by FW without taking
into account the length unit ( bit / 4 bytes). Would you know why ?

If I change the model to match 1 bit / 4 bytes unit of the R_DMA_LEN
register. Linux fails to boot. I didn't dig further and this is
something we need to understand before committing.

Is this 4 bytes alignment new for the AST2700 or is this something
you added because the mask of DMA_LENGTH is now relaxed to match
all addresses ?

#define DMA_LENGTH(val)         ((val) & 0x01FFFFFF)

Thanks,

C.
