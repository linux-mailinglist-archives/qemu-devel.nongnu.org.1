IMHO that should be reverted. The justification says

  "If an fd is added to an fd set via the command line, and it is not
   referenced by another command line option (ie. -drive), then clean
   it up after QEMU initialization is complete"

which I think is pretty weak. Why should QEMU forceably stop an app
from passing in an FD to be used by a QMP command issued just after
the VM starts running ?  While it could just use QMP to pass in the
FD set, the mgmt app might have its own reason for wanting QEMU to
own the passed FD from the very start of the process execve().

Implicitly this cleanup is attempting to "fix" a bug where the mgmt
app passes in an FD that it never needed. If any such bug were ever
found, then the mgmt app should just be fixed to not pass it in. I
don't think QEMU needs to be trying to fix mgmt app bugs.

IOW, this commit is imposing an arbitrary & unecessary usage policy
on passed in FD sets, and as your commit explains has further
unhelpful (& undocumented) side effects on the 'remove-fd' QMP command.

Just revert it IMHO.
