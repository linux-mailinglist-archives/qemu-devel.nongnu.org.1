Or at least will try.

4. In this specific case, init_fn is only used from ctor_fn and even
there only as a function pointer; it is not visible from outside. So
the "unsafe" marker's only purpose is documentation (and in fact, as
you point out in (3), it would even be harmful without
unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn).

Yes, I agree that since we're talking about a macro (not a function
which can itself be annotated with "unsafe") that lies at the C<->Rust
boundary, this is mostly a documentation issue.

In general the documentation of qemu-api and qemu-api-macros leaves
something to be desired. This is okay, but it is also the kind of
technical debt that we need to look at as soon as we can actually get
the thing to compile. :)

I'll add it shortly to https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/Rust.
