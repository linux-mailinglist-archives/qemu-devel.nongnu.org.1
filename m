Yes, we now do a reset of the whole system as a three-phase setup,
and the old pre-three-phase reset APIs like qemu_register_reset() and
device_class_set_legacy_reset() all happen during the "hold" phase.

It's certainly possible for a PCIe device to implement
a three-phase reset which does things in the exit phase. However
I think I would say that such a device which didn't cancel all
outstanding DMA operations during either 'enter' or 'hold'
phases would be broken. If it did some other things during
the 'exit' phase I don't think the ordering of those vs the
iommu 'exit' handling should matter.

(To some extent the splitting into three phases is trying
to set up a consistent model as outlined in docs/devel/reset.rst
and to some extent it's just a convenient way to get a basic
"this reset thing I need to do must happen after some other
device has done its reset things" which you can achieve
by ad-hoc putting them in different phases. Ideally we get
mostly the former and a little pragmatic dose of the latter,
but the consistent model is not very solidly nailed down
so I have a feeling the proportions may not be quite as
lopsided as we'd like :-) )

thanks
