I get that inflight is inside of struct VhostUserBlk, not in struct
vhost_user. Even if not all device types support inflight I think that
could probably be changed? If we do keep things as you have it here
patch 1 should probably bring the vhost_dev_load_inflight() and
vhost_dev_save_inflight() into vhost_user.c rather than vhost.c since
only vhost_user devices seem to use inflight.

I'm not sure about that. While it may be completely safe in your case
to avoid GET_VRING_BASE/quiescing the backend, it could introduce
corruption cases on other vhost-user-blk storage backends which work
differently. I think this would require an "opt-in" migration
parameter over and above checking that it's not a local migration.

Ideally there would be some way to have the vhost-user backends expose
support per device with a protocol feature and, if the source and
destination both advertise support, we perform the inflight migration
skipping GET_VRING_BASE. I don't know enough about the migration code
to know how that would be done or if it is practical.

Also (and I think this also applies to Vladimir's series), it should
be possible to add multiple vhost-user-blk devices to the same Qemu
instance but have the devices backed by very different backend
implementations. What happens if some of those backend implementations
support things like lightweight local migration and/or inflight
migration but others don't? Ideally you would want the API to be able
to select target vhost-user-blk devices for accelerated migration
rather than assuming they will all want to use the same features. I
don't know if anyone is doing that or if we care about such cases but
I just want to throw the concern out there.
