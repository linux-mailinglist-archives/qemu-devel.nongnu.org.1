The split of "virtualization" vs "non-virtualization" use case
in the docs was always as rather a crude hack.

"Virtualization uses cases" was more or less a code phrase to
mean "the subset of QEMU that we traditionally shipped in RHEL"
as that is approximately what we have reasonable confidence
about.

Personally I wouldn't assign strict equivalence between "machine
can use KVM" and  "virtualization use case".

Case in point - the "isapc" machine type can use KVM but I would
not consider that to be a virtualization use case, and would likely
reject a security report if it /only/ affected isapc, and not 'pc'
/ 'q35'.

We didn't want to undertake the work to annotate every QOM/QDev
impl in QEMU with info about whether we considered it in scope
for security fixes or not, which is what we really ought to do
at some point. The main challenge is someone having the time
to do the audit & annotation work.

Currently 'virtualization use case' is reasonably vague such that we can
bend its scope as we desire, at the time it is questioned in a possible
security report.

Machine types are only one aspect of this. Devices are the other, and
the area where it gets significantly more fuzzy and difficult because
essentially any device can be used with KVM, and where we draw the
line is fairly arbitrary.

Daniel
