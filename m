Isn't that a bunch of shuffling code around just to have two different
invocations of migration-test?

There's the possibility of using the gtester path like
/x86_64/migration/smoke and passing '-r' when invoking via meson. That
requires way fewer changes in the C code. It moves the complexity into
meson.build, which might be worse.

Alex's idea of full set for KVM arch + a TCG arch would probably be
trickier in meson.
