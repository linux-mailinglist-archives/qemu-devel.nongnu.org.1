by the vendor of a particular machine, and not by the simulator in =
general. Plus, I have a very real use case where it will come in handy - =
debugging perf. Support the possibility of simulating events on QEMU =
side will make the life of t perf folks much easier. I do not insist =
specifically on my implementation of this solution, but I think that the =
solution with the creation of a callback for each of the events will =
significantly complicate the porting of the PMU for machine vendors.

Yeah, it=E2=80=99s even better to do it separately, agreed. Do you want =
me to do
 general part? Or we gonna split it in some way?
