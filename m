Hello all,

Sorry, I have been a bit disconnected from this thread as I was on
vacations and then had to switch tasks for a while.

I will try to go through all comments and address them for the first
non-RFC drop of this patch series.

But I was discussing with some colleagues on this. So turns out rust-vmm's
vhost-user-gpu will potentially use
this soon, and a rust-vmm/vhost patch have been already posted:
https://github.com/rust-vmm/vhost/pull/251.
So I think it may make sense to:
1. Split the vhost-user documentation patch once settled. Since it is taken
as the official spec,
    having it upstreamed independently of the implementation will benefit
other projects to
    work/integrate their own code.
2. Split READ_/WRITE_MEM messages from SHMEM_MAP/_UNMAP patches.
    If I remember correctly, this addresses a virtio-fs specific issue,
that will not
    impact either virtio-gpu nor virtio-media, or any other. So it may make
sense
    to separate them so that one does not stall the other. I will try to
have both
    integrated in the mid term.

WDYT?

BR,
Albert.

&gt; &gt; &gt; and MEM_WRITE commands, since as far as I know crosvm doesn&=

&gt; &gt; &gt; anything like that.=C2=A0 The discussion leading to those be=

&gt; &gt; &gt; here:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href=3D"https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20240604185416=

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It would be great if this could be standardised between QEMU=
 and crosvm<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (and therefore have a clearer path toward being implemented =
in other VMMs)!<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Setting aside vhost-user for a moment, the DAX example given by S=
tefan<br>
&gt; &gt; won&#39;t work in crosvm today.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Is universal access to virtio shared memory regions actually mand=
ated<br>
&gt; &gt; by the virtio spec? Copying from virtiofs DAX to virtiofs sharing=
<br>
&gt; &gt; seems reasonable enough, but what about virtio-pmem to virtio-blk=
?<br>
&gt; &gt; What about screenshotting a framebuffer in virtio-gpu shared memo=
ry to<br>
&gt; &gt; virtio-scsi? I guess with some plumbing in the VMM, it&#39;s solv=
able in a<br>
&gt; &gt; virtualized environment. But what about when you have real hardwa=
re<br>
&gt; &gt; that speaks virtio involved? That&#39;s outside my wheelhouse, bu=
t it<br>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t seem like that would be easy to solve.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Yes, it can work for physical devices if allowed by host configuration=
.<br>
&gt; E.g. VFIO supports that I think. Don&#39;t think VDPA does.<br>
<br>
I&#39;m sure it can work, but that sounds more like a SHOULD (MAY?),<br>
rather than a MUST.<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; For what it&#39;s worth, my interpretation of the target scenario=
:<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Other backends don&#39;t see these mappings. If the guest su=
bmits a vring<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; descriptor referencing a mapping to another backend, then th=
at backend<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; won&#39;t be able to access this memory<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; is that it&#39;s omitting how the implementation is reconciled wi=
th<br>
&gt; &gt; section 2.10.1 of v1.3 of the virtio spec, which states that:<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; References into shared memory regions are represented as off=
sets from<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the beginning of the region instead of absolute memory addre=
sses. Offsets<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; are used both for references between structures stored withi=
n shared<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; memory and for requests placed in virtqueues that refer to s=
hared memory.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; My interpretation of that statement is that putting raw guest phy=
sical<br>
&gt; &gt; addresses corresponding to virtio shared memory regions into a vr=
ing<br>
&gt; &gt; is a driver spec violation.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; -David<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; This really applies within device I think. Should be clarified ...<br>
<br>
You mean that a virtio device can use absolute memory addresses for<br>
other devices&#39; shared memory regions, but it can&#39;t use absolute mem=
ory<br>
addresses for its own shared memory regions? That&#39;s a rather strange<br=
