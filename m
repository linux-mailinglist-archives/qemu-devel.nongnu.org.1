This is interesting because it would allow a test to be considered in
more than one subsystem. There are many tests that invoke migration
themselves.

Hopefully meson won't take this as a hint to construct a 1000 characters
long line when invoking the test.

Great. Looking forward to those.

Thanks for the introduction. I'll pick some self-contained part of
migration and see how far we are from being able to write unit tests.
