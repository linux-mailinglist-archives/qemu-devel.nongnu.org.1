Reasonable.

But consider also the discussion with Fabiano in v5, where he argues against fds
(reasonable too):

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/87y0qatqoa.fsf@suse.de/

(still, they were against my "fds" name for the parameter, which is
really too generic, fd-passing is not)

and the arguments for backend-transfer (to read similar with cpr-transfer)

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/87ms6qtlgf.fsf@suse.de/

I think, we can call "backend" any external object, linked by the fd.

Still, backend/frontend terminology is so misleading, when applied to
complex systems (for me, at least), that I don't really like "-backend"
word here.

fd-passing is OK for me, I can resend with it, if arguments by Fabiano
not change your mind.

Right. I rely on checking in qemu_file_get_fd() / qemu_file_set_fd()
handlers.

But of course, earlier clean failure of qmp-migrate / qmp-incoming-migate
commands would be nice, will do.

Like this, I think:

diff --git a/migration/migration.c b/migration/migration.c
