first and then updating the code to match the spec 100%. Also I heard Marti=
n has some arch compliance tests for J-ext somewhere.

The cover letter says that this implements version 1.0 of the spec,
this sounds like it doesn't.

Also, it's better to make the changes on top of the current code.
Instead of constantly removing and re-adding the code. Which is then
hard to review. Especially as I'm guessing there isn't a huge
difference between v0.8 and v1.0.

Thanks. Can you be very clear which version of the spec you have
developed and tested against as well.
