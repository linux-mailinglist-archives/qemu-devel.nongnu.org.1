I agree we shouldn't overload the meaning if deprecated.

So to this case in point. Is there anything you can do with usb/hub that
you can't do with the newer xhci based one? Is it backward compatible
enough that an old kernel would work? Or are we talking really old
kernels at this point?

Is there non-PC hardware that utilises these hubs?
