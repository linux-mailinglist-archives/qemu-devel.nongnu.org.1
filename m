Thank you for sharing your thoughts.

I agree that busy waiting is not ideal.
However, considering the timing of when target QEMU creates and begins 
listening on the socket,
I think there is currently no reliable way for the host to check the 
socket's listening state.
This also implies that FD passing is not a viable option in this case.

As for the 'defer' option in qtest,
it doesn't cause race-condition issues because the target enters the 
listening state during the option processing.

Of course, to address this issue,
I could create a wait_for_socket() function similar to wait_for_serial() 
in qtest framework.
Since the socket might already be created, I cannot simply wait for the 
file to appear using file system notification APIs like inotify,
so busy-waiting would still be necessary.

I would appreciate hearing any further thoughts you might have on this.
