Why are you removing this ? The commit above does not make any reference
to the problem being a missing URL (404 code). We want missing URLs to
be fatal so that we identify when images we rely on are deleted by their
host, as that is not a transient problem.

So is the bit that actually deals with the exception you show in the
jobs above.

Best practice would be for us to define an 'AssetException' and use that
in assert.py when raising exceptions, or to wrap other exceptions in cases
where we propagate exceptions. Then this code can be move tailored to
catch AssetException, instead of Exception.


With regards,
Daniel
