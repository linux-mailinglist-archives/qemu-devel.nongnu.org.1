Your last sentence here seems to agree with this approach, but
everything else suggests disapproval, so I don't know where you're
going here.

I have no specs for this device, nor any involvement from the device
vendor, so the idea of creating a vfio-pci variant driver to setup an
irq_domain and augment a device specific SET_IRQs ioctls not only sounds
tremendously more complicated (host and VMM), it's simply not possible
with the knowledge we have at hand.  Making this device work in a VM is
dead in the water if that's the bar to achieve.

I observe that the device configures MSI vectors and then writes that
same vector address/data elsewhere into the device.  Whether the device
can trigger those vectors based only on the MSI capability programming
and a secondary source piggybacks on those vectors or if this is just a
hack by Qualcomm to use an MSI capability to acquire some vectors which
are exclusively used by the secondary hardware, I have no idea.  Who
can even say if this is just a cost saving measure that a PCI config
space is slapped into a platform device and there's simply no hw/fw
support to push the vector data into the hardware and the driver
bridges the gap.

The solution here is arguably fragile, we're relying on having a
sufficiently unique MSI address that we can recognize writes with that
value in order to both replace it with the host value and mark the
location of the data register.  If someone with some hardware insight
wants to come along and provide a reference for static locations of
these writes, I'd certainly welcome it.  My sample size is one, which
is why this is posted as an RFT.

I do not believe that introducing a vfio device feature that disables
virtualization of the MSI address/data _only_ at the vfio interface
(not to a QEMU VM) provides some implicit support of this device
behavior.  These values are already available to a privileged user in
the host and the same is available for an MSI-X use case by directly
reading the MSI-X vector table.  The only point of the vfio device
feature is that we need a vehicle to expose the MSI phsyical
address/data values through he vfio channel, without additional host
privileges.  The virtualized values are essentially unused by QEMU, so
why not give QEMU a way to turn off the virtualization to expose the
host values.  Thanks,

Alex
