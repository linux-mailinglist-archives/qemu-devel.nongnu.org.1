I think that's the thing we need to figure out for add-fd usages.  The bad
thing is there're too many qemu_open_internal() users... so we can't easily
tell what we're looking for. May need some time reading the code or the
history.. pretty sad.  I hope someone can chim in.

That should be all fine, see:

$ git grep " syscall(" | wc -l
28

And if we want we can also do fcntl(F_GETFL) on both fds later, making sure
they have proper flags (one must have O_DIRECT, one must not).
