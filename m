Originally memory access logs were a debug define that then were
converted to log messages but were classified as guest_errors which
already logs misc errors. As invalid memory access logs can come from
accessing not emulated peripherals or memory areas, these often
generate a lot of messages that are better be controlled separately
from other errors to avoid obscuring those. As an example try
'qemu-system-ppc -d guest_errors' to see the problem. After this
series the actual guest error logs are easier to spot. I've tried to
submit this before but there were some people who liked the current
behaviour so now this series has another patch that preserves the old
optino printing a warning to allow time to get used to the new
behaviour (which actually brings back the old behaviour when mem
access logs were a debug define).

Regards,

  log: Add separate debug option for logging invalid memory accesses
