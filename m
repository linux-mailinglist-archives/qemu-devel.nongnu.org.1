Or do you expect a new e500 machine to be added? In that case I'd set above arbitrary values as default and expect a new machine to override these properties.

That one seems to use 0x0606180c for this value which I think corresponds to 0/1 Ratio both 3:1, DDR Ratio 12:1 and Plat Ratio 6:1. I think one property to set the 32 bit value without individual fields would be enough and we can put comments next to the value if needed to note what components it comes from. Or if you just need any value here maybe you could take this one then that would be good for me as well.

That's also OK with me. No need to mention any specific machine as I'm not 
sure I'll ever finish it. So far it's only an experiment and only planned 
to submit the small patches that came out of it but it's not emulating any 
machine yet.

That's the plan eventually but I don't know when will I have time to do 
that. So far I had a hard coded SPD data for testing but I wanted to 
update the generating function for a while but lacked time for it. This 
gives another reason to do that finally but may take a while.
