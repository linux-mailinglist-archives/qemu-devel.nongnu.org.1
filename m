This is more or less the handshake idea. Or at least it could be
included in that work.

I have parked the handshake idea for now because I'm not seeing an
immediate need for it and there are more pressing issues to be dealt
with first such as bugs and coordinating the new features (and their
possible outcomings) that IMO need to be looked at first.

Yes this means main channel + others.

I'm not opposed to that idea. When I started working with migration I
had the impression that was the direction and that we could put every
workload in a pool of multifd threads. Now, knowing the code better, I'm
not sure that's feasible. Specially the dependence on a "main" channel
seems difficult to do away with. It's also somewhat convenient to have a
maint thread. But we could still attempt to group extra threads, such as
what we're doing with the new thread pool in the device state series. At
least thread management could be done entirely in a separate pool, main
channel and all.
