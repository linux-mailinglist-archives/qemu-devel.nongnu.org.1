This is the first cross-host time diff, I assume the two hosts are
synchronized and the time diff is pretty low.

I guess part like this is not accounted in the switchover decision by src
QEMU, with the hope that after src QEMU sent everything with the estimated
bandwidth the dest QEMU should have (mostly) loaded everything.

It might be interesting to know when this can grow much larger than we
expect.  More below..

So have you figured out how VFIO affected this?  I thought VFIO will also
report pending information just like RAM, in ->state_pending_exact().

However I don't think such reports involves things like read()/write() over
the VFIO fds.  I assume that can be a major issue that won't be captured by
any form of pending data reports.  It might be useful to first identify /
verify this issue, then think about how to improve the estimation of
downtimes, e.g. by reporting "extra time" (in this case, the time to do
read() / write() from the device driver) needed for the final dump stage
for either iterative/non-iterative data.

I'm personally curious on whether you can nail the current issues down to
VFIO, and if so whether there can be something we can do already to improve
downtime estimation when VFIO is involved, irrelevant of the rest.

For a generic idea of improving downtime, I think as long as we stick with
downtime_limit parameter untouched (reflecting the total & max downtime),
then we can add some new ideas on top.
