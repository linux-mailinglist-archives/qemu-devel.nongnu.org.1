Yes.

We can add this into `get_cluster_count_for_direntry` loop.
I'm thinking of also converting those `abort` into `assert`, since
the line `copy_it = 1;` was confusing me, since it was after the `abort`.

I think this would be the better design (tbh, that's what I thought 
`first_mapping_index` would do), though not sure if other components
depend so much into the current design that it would be hard to change.

I'll try to implement this `prev_mapping_index` and see how it goes.

I think, I'm still confused on the whole logic there, the function
`get_cluster_count_for_direntry` is a mess, and it doesn't just
*get* the cluster count, it also schedule writeouts and may
copy clusters around.

Indeed, I did a quick change, modifying the loop to always go through
and set the `first_mapping_index` for the first mapping fixes the issue
and we can put the `abort` back in place.

I'll also modify the check to instead be 
`mapping->first_mapping_index < 0 && mapping->info.file.offset > 0`
This will make it clear that this applies only to the first mapping.
