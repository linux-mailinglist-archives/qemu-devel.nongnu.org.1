If by 'fallback' you mean the idea where we would use -accel kvm -accel tcg, where
we try to use KVM and then, if not available or failed, we use TCG, yes. That was
the reason.

To make that work I needed to homogenize all -accel options, i.e. it wouldn't be
able to have both TCG and KVM as -accel options in the command line, otherwise
something setting 'merge_lists' in a command line like this:

-accel tcg -accel kvm,propA=true -accel kvm,propB=false

would yield

-accel tcg,propA=true,propB=false

To be honest, I'm not sure. I can't talk on the motivations to have -globals
for devices, but if the same reasoning applies to all other objects, I think
it's ok.

As far as -accel goes I really thing that the elephant in the room is that
-accel is an oddball. "-accel kvm -accel tcg" being a thing is weird. Why not
-accel kvm,fallback=true if we want a fallback mechanic for KVM? Do we have
a strong use case (i.e. libvirt) to keep this mixed accel options around?

Note that this patch doesn't make things particularly better: I'm using globals
to emulate what should be regular command line behavior for -accel. It's kind
of a cope out for a more complex issue.

It does. Verified with printfs and debugs. I copied what's done for -devices and
applied to -accel, which means that the global value is applied after the command
line options, doing an overwrite on whatever was set before. You can see that
happening in accel_init_machine() in this patch.


Thanks,
