From what I've seen in other projects, S-o-B means that you accept=20
accountability for everything above. One scenario would be:

- Send original patch, which has been tested inside the company:

  Tested-by: Tester <tester@example.com>
  Signed-off-by: Developper <developper@example.com>

- Get some R-b, but need to make some requested minor changes and=20
  resend a new patch series:

  Tested-by: Tester <tester@example.com>
  Reviewed-by: Reviewer <reviewer@othercompany.com>
  Signed-off-by: Developper <developper@example.com>

  This is a way of saying "I guarantee that the R-b still applies=20
  after the new changes I made to this series"

- Then reviewed and pulled into their tree by the maintainer:

  Tested-by: Tester <tester@example.com>
  Reviewed-by: Reviewer <reviewer@othercompany.com>
  Signed-off-by: Developper <developper@example.com>
  Reviewed-by: Maintainer <maintainer@org.org>
  Signed-off-by: Maintainer <maintainer@org.org>

If, after being reviewed, the initial patch would not have needed=20
any change, the order would have been:

  Tested-by: Tester <tester@example.com>
  Signed-off-by: Developper <developper@example.com>
  Reviewed-by: Reviewer <reviewer@othercompany.com>
  Reviewed-by: Maintainer <maintainer@org.org>
  Signed-off-by: Maintainer <maintainer@org.org>

This is consistent with what software like "b4" do: if the S-o of=20
the current user is present, it is moved last, as the current user=20
is the one accepting accountability at this point.

However, this is not what QEMU has been using as far as I can see,=20
as S-o-b tend to stay in their original positions. I even opened=20
an issue on b4 a few weeks ago because of this=20
<https://github.com/mricon/b4/issues/16>, and I reverted to using=20
git-publish. But if this is ok to use an arbitrary order for=20
non-S-o-b headers, I can get back to b4.
