Thanks both.  Please keep us posted.

Just to double check, we're comparing "tcp:" v.s. "rdma:", RoCE is not
involved, am I right?

The other note is that the comparison needs to be with multifd enabled for
the "tcp:" case.  I'd suggest we start with 8 threads if it's 100Gbps.

I think I can still fetch some 100Gbps or even 200Gbps nics around our labs
without even waiting for months.  If you want I can try to see how we can
test together.  And btw I don't think we need a cluster, IIUC we simply
need two hosts, 100G nic on both sides?  IOW, it seems to me we only need
two cards just for experiments, systems that can drive the cards, and a
wire supporting 100G?
