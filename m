Sorry for the delay; too many distractions, and I needed a good think.

Second thoughts; see below.

When you need to tack a mark to one or more things for whatever purpose
*and* expose it to QMP clients, then features make sense.  This is the
case here.

Initially, features were strictly an external interface annotation, and
were not meant to be used within QEMU.  All features were user-defined.

This changed when I created configurable policy for deprecated and
unstable management interfaces: the policy engine needs to check for
features 'deprecated' and 'unstable'.  Since the policy engine is partly
implemented in generated code, these two features need to be baked into
the generator.  This makes them special.

You need less than that: a predicate "does <command> have <feature>" for
certain features, ideally without baking them into the generator.

The command registry already tracks each command's special features for
use by the policy engine.  Obvious idea: also track the features you
want to pass to the predicate.

Your series adds tracking for exactly the features you need:

* Enumerate them in the schema with new pragma command-features

  Missing: documentation for the pragma.

* Generate an extension QapiSpecialFeatureCustom of existing enum
  QapiSpecialFeature, which is not generated.  The latter is in
  qapi/util.h, the former in ${prefix}qapi-init-commands.h.

* Mark these features special for commands only, so existing registry
  machinery tracks them.  Do *not* make them special elsewhere, because
  that would break things.

  Feels like a hack.  Minor trap: if you use the same feature in
  multiple schemas, multiple generated headers will define the same enum
  constant, possibly with different values.  If you manage to include
  the wrong header *and* the value differs there, you'll likely lose
  hair.

* Missing: tests.

I think we can avoid supplying most of the missing bits.  The main QAPI
schema uses five features: deprecated, unstable,
allow-write-only-overlay, dynamic-auto-read-only, fdset.  The QGA QAPI
schema uses four, namely the four you add in this series.  Why not track
all features, and dispense with the pragma?  Like this:

* Change type of feature bitsets to uint64_t (it's unsigned now).

* Error out if a schema has more than 64 features.

* Move enum QapiSpecialFeature into a new generated header.

* Generate a member for each feature, not just the two predefined ones.

* Pass all command features to the registry, not just the special ones.

* Recommended: do the same elsewhere, i.e. replace
  gen_special_features() by gen_features().

Thoughts?


PS: I think I spotted a number of additional minor issues in your
series, but I won't describe them here, as I hope the simplification
will make most of them go away.
