Frankly I don't have a strong opinion on current patch 14 or the new
proposal, but it seems we reached a consensus.

Fabiano, would you repost with a formal patch, with the proper tags?

One thing I am still not sure is whether we should still have patch 13
altogether? Please see my other reply on whether it's possible to have
migrate_get_error() == true but qemu_file_get_error() == false.  In
postcopy_pause(), currently we constantly shutdown() so the join() should
always work:

        qemu_file_shutdown(file);
        qemu_fclose(file);

        /*
         * We're already pausing, so ignore any errors on the return
         * path and just wait for the thread to finish. It will be
         * re-created when we resume.
         */
        close_return_path_on_source(s);

If move close_return_path_on_source() upper, qemu_file_shutdown() may not
be needed? And I think we need to make sure close_return_path_on_source()
will always properly kick the other thread.

Thanks,
