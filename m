Immediate question is whether anything similar is done in other use cases
in QEMU?   There are vaguely similar things that work via a socket but
I'm not sure the mix of a shared buffer and a qmp based doorbell is done
elsewhere.  There is use of shared memory for inter VM comms but that uses
a socket for it's doorbell / interrupt path, not qmp.
https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/specs/ivshmem-spec.html

So without looking in that much detail yet, I'm not yet convinced this is
preferable to a socket over which we can send the mctp packets.

In general we need to also solve how to upstream the mctp support in
qemu or this is adding yet more stuff to my cxl staging tree.

+CC Markus for QMP part.

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250408043051.430340-1-nifan.cxl@gmail.com/
is start of thread.
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250408043051.430340-3-nifan.cxl@gmail.com/
the qmp patch adding what is more or less a doorbell pinged by a device
on a different  QEMU instance.
