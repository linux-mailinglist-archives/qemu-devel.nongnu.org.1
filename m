It doesn't appear because the list of properties that we advertise
via query-cpu-model-expansion is set in the cpu_model_advertised_features[]
array in target/arm/arm-qmp-cmds.c, and this patch doesn't add
'kvm-pmu-filter' to it. But you have a good point about all the
others being bool properties: I don't know enough about that
mechanism to know if simply adding this to the list is right.

This does raise a more general question: do we need to advertise
the existence of this property to libvirt via QMP? Eric, Sebastian:
do you know ?

If we don't care about this being visible to libvirt then the
importance of having a test case covering the command line
syntax goes down a bit.

But if the user explicitly asked for it, it's not optional
for them, it's something they want. We should fail if the user
passes us an option that we can't actually carry out.

That just says it is a per-vcpu ioctl, it doesn't say why...

No, you should check syntax and parse the string in
kvm_pmu_filter_set(), and fill in a data structure so you don't
have to do any string parsing here. kvm_pmu_filter_get()
will need to reconstitute a string from the data structure.
