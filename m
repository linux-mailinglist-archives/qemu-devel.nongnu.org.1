You can take this alternative for now:

https://patchew.org/QEMU/cover.1719690591.git.balaton@eik.bme.hu/

I think solving it the right way would need to QDev-ify i8259 and make it 
use gpio out and get rid of the legacy init function but as that's an old 
piece of code used by multiple machines, it's not easily done so maybe not 
for few days before the freeze.

For now I think either embedding the IRQ in the state struct (or 
alternatively adding an unrealize or finalize or whatever is the right 
method to free it) is better than changing all users of this device.

BALATON Zoltan
