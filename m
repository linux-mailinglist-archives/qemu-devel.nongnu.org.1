I think the idea I vaguely have in the back of my mind is that
maybe it's a nice idea to have a coding structure that enforces
"you update your own internal state, and only then do things that
might involve calling out to the outside world, and if there's
something that you need to do with the result of that callout,
there's an easy mechanism for 'this is what I will want to do
next after that' continuations".

The fact that our C device implementations don't do that is
kind of the underlying cause of all the "recursive entry back
into the device via DMA" problems that we squashed with the
big hammer of "just forbid it entirely". It's also in a way
the problem underlying the race condition segfault here:
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/CAFEAcA9odnPo2LPip295Uztri7JfoVnQbkJ=3DW=
n+k8dQneB_ynQ@mail.gmail.com/T/#u
(memory_region_snapshot_and_clear_dirty() drops the BKL, no
callers expect that, segfaults in the calling code in the
framebuffer device models if something else gets in and
e.g. resizes the framebuffer in the middle of a display update).

So I was sort of wondering if the pl011 structure was aiming
at providing that kind of separation of "internal state" and
"external interactions", such that the compiler would complain
if you tried to do an externally-interacting thing while your
internal state was not consistent.
