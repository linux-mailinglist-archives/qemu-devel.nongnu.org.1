Right, it's just that the level of care to bring everything up to that
standard is currently more effort than I'd like to spend.

Ideally everything WOULD be on the same standard, but...

Yeah, exactly. It took me long enough to do this with qmp, machine, qom and
qapi. It'll take aeons for iotests.

It's just not on my radar right now as a priority.

More tractable: protect everything used for the build to that high
standard, worry about the rest later.

It's possible I can extend a "lower standard" to everything outside of
python/ to help enforce the basics, without mandatory typing.

(I did add an iotest checker to python/ tests that enforces a lower
standard to those tests. I intend to remove iotests 297 once I get a
top-level "make check-python" instituted.)

I don't think one unified standard is something we can do in the near term.
Mechanically I think it's easy, but in practice pushing all the linting
patches through has been like pulling teeth and I've lost appetite for
pursuing it beyond whatever is *super duper important*.

In retrospect, 3.6 was too early to try adding static typing. I think I
won't bother for anything else until we have 3.9 as a minimum. After the
pushback last time, I doubt I'll make the push any time soon unless
something really urgent comes up.

Not against this in the future, I just think there are some higher priority
items to take care of first:

* Begin protecting qapi with the existing python static analysis regime
* Add a "make check-python" target to the top level makefile that can set
up the environment it needs on-demand and handles what python/'s "make
check-minreqs" currently does (incl iotest 297)
* Drop python/qemu/qmp from the tree in favor of the standalone package.
There are mkvenv changes I'm currently developing here to make this happen.
It's a little involved due to the wide spread of setuptools versions on
platforms we support.

Once I drill through these, I'm more than happy to try to support/maintain
everything else to a lower baseline of care. Maybe this winter, if you'd be
willing to volunteer some review time for the push.
