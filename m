The loop has run 3000 times by itself so that part is stable. However, 
it seems there is some other test case that the loop cannot run in 
parallel with. So, yes there is 'something'. ... ... Just having all 
CPUs in a system busy requires waiting for migration to be complete on 
the dst_qemu side as well. Can you try it with this patch:

diff --git a/tests/qtest/tpm-tests.c b/tests/qtest/tpm-tests.c

                       sizeof(tpm_pcrread_resp));


For me this fixes the issue I had seen where reading the STS register 
was done too early before all the TPM TIS state was completely restored. 
The active locality was -1 and STS return 0xffffffff and from then on 
things went bad.
