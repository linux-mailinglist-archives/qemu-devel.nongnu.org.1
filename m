Sorry to respond late, I kept getting other things interrupting me when I
wanted to look at this..

I just sent a series here, allowing TYPE_OBJECT of any kind to be able to
work with machine compat properties:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/20251209162857.857593-1-peterx@redhat.com

I still want to see if we can stick with compat properties in general
whenever it's about defining guest ABI.

What you proposed should work, but that'll involve a 2nd way of probing
"what is the guest ABI" by providing a new QMP query command and then set
them after mgmt queries both QEMUs then set the subset of both.  It will be
finer granule but as I discussed previously, I think it's re-inventing the
wheels, and it may cause mgmt over-bloated on caring too many trivial
details of per-device specific details.

Please have a look to see the feasibility.  As mentioned in the cover
letter, that will need further work to e.g. QOMify TAP first at least for
your series.  But I don't yet see it as a blocker?  After QOMified, it can
inherit directly the OBJECT_COMPAT then TAP can add compat properties.

I wonder if vhost-usr-blk can already use compat properties.
