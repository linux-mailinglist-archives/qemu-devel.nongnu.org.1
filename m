context:
This series was trying to stop savevm from crashing when arbitrary
migration capabilities are enabled. Daniel brought up the previous
discussion around unifying capabilities + parameters and passing it all
via the migrate (or snapshot in this case) command arguments. I'm
looking into that now.
