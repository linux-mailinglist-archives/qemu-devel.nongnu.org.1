We are using "conditional", but I think we don't really require any
specific mode, because we drop the bitmaps after mirroring (even in
failure case). Fabian, please correct me if I'm wrong.

I'm not sure actually. Maybe John remembers?

I see, I'll drop the 'bitmap-mode' in the next version if nobody
complains :)
