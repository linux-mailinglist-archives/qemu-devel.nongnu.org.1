Yes, QEMU should probably better be able to work on both old/new kernels,
even if this will be fixed.

I'll still put "better understand the behavior of VM" into debugging
category. :)

But I agree such can be important information.  That's also why I was
curious whether it should be something like a QMP event instead.  That's a
much formal way of sending important messages.

IMHO fixing hugetlb page is still a progress on its own, even without any
added error message, or proactive allocation during reset.

One issue is the v8 still contains patch 3 which is for ARM kvm.. You may
need to post it separately for ARM maintainers to review & collect.  I'll
be able to queue patch 1-2.
