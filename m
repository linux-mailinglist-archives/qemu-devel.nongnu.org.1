That is indeed 'novel' in a DRAM device, but maybe it could be battery
backed and have a path to say a flash device that isn't visible to CXL
and form which the DRAM is refilled on power restore?

Anyhow, doesn't make sense for persistent memory that doesn't correspond
to all the other stuff in the DRAM event.

Yes. If you can use transaction type that solves this issue I think.
