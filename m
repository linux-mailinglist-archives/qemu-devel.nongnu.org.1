U just need someone whose .og personally invested to tell youwhay needs to
go. As a third party it'd obvious..remember the kernel and drivers ate not

Also kernel was written  for free but drivers use a very high overhead..so
which system deserves world domination.

None stupid it about the people not the crap we argue over at our nightjobs
