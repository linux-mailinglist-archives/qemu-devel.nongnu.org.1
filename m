Blocking migration when enforce=false is making an assumption
that users of that setting are inherantly broken. This is NOT
the case if the user/app has already validated compatibility in
some manner outside QEMU. Blocking migration in this case will
break valid working use cases.

IMHO this patch doesn't need to exist. If users of QEMU want
strong protection they can already opt-in to that with enforce=true.

With regards,
Daniel
