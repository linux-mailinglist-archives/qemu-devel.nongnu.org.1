"As long as after a proper commit() completes" is what we are trying to 
avoid. Think of the following sequence:

memory_region_transaction_begin()
object_unparent(mr)
g_free(mr)
mr = g_new0(MemoryRegion, 1) // reuse the storage for another MR
address_space_init(as, mr, "as")
memory_region_transaction_commit()

address_space_init() will use the value keyed with the dangling pointer 
in flat_views.

Removing a dangling reference is safer than leaving it. Some code that 
assumes the reference will not be gone may get surprised and cause a 
NULL dereference, but that almost always result in SIGSEGV instead of 
memory corruptions. Such segfault is as easy to debug as SIGABRT 
triggered by assertions.
