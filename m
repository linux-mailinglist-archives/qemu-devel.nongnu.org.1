It's not very useful if you have to include all the preludes though :)

Also, prelude feels a bit too much magic and may pollute namespace. In
general, not so many crates provide them and that's usually a good thing
imho, since you can explicitly import what you need, and LSP and good error
report make that fairly trivial.

So, I am not convinced having each crate its own prelude is a good thing,
but I don't care much. Can easily be added back though.

True, I will move it

I am not sure, but I can try. Alternatively, we can have a build.rs
symlink, if we can guess the module path.
