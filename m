Normally, Sphinx will silently fall back to its standard field list
processing if it doesn't match one of your defined fields. A lot of the
time, that's not what we want - we want to be warned if we goof
something up.

For instance, the canonical argument field list form is:

:arg type name: descr

This form is captured by Sphinx and transformed so that the field label
will become "Arguments:". It's possible to omit the type name and descr
and still have it be processed correctly. However, if you omit the type
name, Sphinx no longer recognizes it:

:arg: this is not recognized.

This will turn into an arbitrary field list entry whose label is "Arg:",
and it otherwise silently fails. You may also see failures for doing
things like using :values: instead of :value:, or :errors: instead of
:error:, and so on. It's also case sensitive, and easy to trip up.

Add a validator that guarantees all field list entries that are the
direct child of an ObjectDescription use only recognized forms of field
lists, and emit a warning (treated as error by default in most build
configurations) whenever we detect one that is goofed up.

However, there's still benefit to allowing arbitrary fields -- they are
after all not a Sphinx invention, but perfectly normal docutils
syntax. Create an allow list for known spellings we don't mind letting
through, but warn against anything else.

-

RFC: Yes, this patch breaks the build! I thought it'd be helpful for you
to see the error checking in action. The next commit drops the erroneous
fields.
