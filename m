There are a bunch of reasons why you'd want the less common drivers to
be running outside qemu, and not be a part of qemu at all:

 - It's more secure, not just because it's running in a separate
   process, but because you can confine the process differently (eg
   with SELinux).

 - The command line is far simpler and more intuitive compared to,
   say, q-s-d.

 - There's a simple nbd:// URI scheme for these endpoints, and a whole
   suite of tools for querying, copying and modifying these NBD
   endpoints, like nbdinfo, nbdcopy, nbddump, nbdsh, (and more).  This
   is all based on public standards and interoperability tests, with
   clients in several programming languages.

 - You can consume NBD elsewhere than just from qemu, including over
   the network.

 - Huge array of weird and ugly plugins that wouldn't be desirable or
   even possible in qemu (because they are proprietary like VDDK, or
   written in Python or other scripting languages like our AWS
   support).  Also a much wider choice of programming languages -
   vvfat might be more tractable if written in a scripting language.

 - A number of out of tree plugins that companies develop, which we
   enable because we have hard ABI guarantees, but qemu does not (and
   I understand why qemu does not do this, and those are good reasons).

Indeed, nbdkit-floppy-plugin doesn't support writes to the backing
filesystem right now.  Some others I listed in the original email do
support writes, and you can add a COW layer on top of any of them
(which is not the same thing of course).
