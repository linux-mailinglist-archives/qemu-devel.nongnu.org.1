OK, and the broken earlycon may be masking what is going on, as we should at
least see some console output before things fail.  The earlcon fix is in 6.13
not 6.12.

I was able to test your or1k.tgz image and figure out what is wrong.  Your
run-qemu.sh script has 'console=FIXME'.  This command line argument is taken in
and is causing the boot process to not be able to find the console.

Changing it to 'console=ttyS0' allows me to see the output.

I put a branch with the qemu patches I have here:

  - https://github.com/stffrdhrn/qemu/tree/or1k-9.2.0-fixes-1

The kernel command line is injected by qemu into the qemu generated
devicetree.  I notice when I boot your kernel with the reverted FDT alignment
fix the console prints:

    Kernel command line: earlycon

This means that the qemu devicetree is not being used, hence the command line
args are not working.  The qemu device tree not being used is not good, but that
is why reverting the alignment fix 'seems' to fix the issue.  To me the revert
looks to be breaking the qemu devicetree allowing us to fall back to the kernel
supplied devicetree.

This gave me a clue as to what was going on.

Thanks for the steps.  I was just using the or1k.tgz you provided earlier.  The
above will help if I want to try some kernel fixes on my own.

As I mentioned above this is a good clue and explains why the alignment "fix"
fixes your issue.

Using -initrd should work.  But also using the statically linked initramfs
should be fine too.  The setup I use for testing uses virt with a virtio block
driver.

When using qemu with -initrd qemu will back the kernel, initrd and fdt one after
the other into memory as per.

[ kernel ] - Loads from 0x100 (based on elf layout)
[ initrd ] - page aligned
[  fdt   ] - page aligned devicetree (revert moved to 4 bytes aligned)

The fdt address gets placed into r3 which the kernel uses to find the qemu FDT.
Finding the FDT one of the first steps of the boot processes.

As mentioned, it's causing us to switch off access to the QEMU supplied
FDT which is allowing the uart to work.

If you provide command line args console=ttyS0 things will work.

Also console=ttyS0 is not used as all as it should be the default in QEMU.

It looks like I didnt need this to solve the issue.  But I will need it soon.
sigh.

It looks like the root cause of the issue was the 'console=FIXME'.

I hope it helps.
