Yes, I think this is probably on net a good idea (it's a migration
compat break but I think that's OK for 'max', right?). But in
IRC discussion it turned out that the perf loss mjt's users are
seeing is between 7.2 and 8.2, whereas we've had pauth be QARMA5
for much longer than that. So it seems like a good idea to track
down exactly what's caused it to appear as a problem now, before
we start changing the default.
