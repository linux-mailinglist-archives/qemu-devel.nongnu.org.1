Got it. I'm wondering why vBIOS still writes HPA instead of GPA when
it's in virtual machine, maybe the address is hardcoded?

Yes these patches provide a complete legacy mode passthrough solution,
from EFI DXE phase to guest OS, but the EFI part requires specific
changes in edk2.

Actually the only machine supports legacy mode is i440fx, windows driver
checks the vendor and device id of LPC bridge device at 00:1f.0, if it
doesn't match, display driver won't work [1]. On q35 machine, there is
already a emulated ICH9 LPC at 00.1f.0. Previous there was a try in
modifying the id, but it breaks functionality [2].

I had a try "Univerisal Pass-through" mode as igd-assign.txt with my
UHD 770. On linux guest, it works just as a normal gpu, except there
is no display output before i915 driver loaded. Even the device's vbdf
is not 00:02.0, and i915 log shows the DSM is 0M, it works perfectly.
intel_gpu_top shows igpu is working when I am playing a youtube video.

I also tried setting primary gpu in bios to discrete gpu, which makes
the pci class code of igpu changed from 0x030000 (VGA compatible 
controller) to 0x308000 (Display controller), it can still output to
monitor connected to it on Linux guest. All with a simple
    -device vfio-pci,host=00:02.0,id=hostdev0

But for windows guest, I never had any luck. I attached a virtio-gpu to
it, with intel grahics drivers installed in guest. If igd is not at
00:02.0 or gop driver is not provided, windows BSOD immediately on boot

I'm afraid the answer is no, these edk2 changes are not fully open
source as they were taken from inten directly [3], except the last
patch. (It seems intel uses a modified qemu as "etc/igd-dsm-base"
used in patch 5 doesn't exist in qemu, probably they are creating
a identical GPA->HPA mapping for igd?).

One of these intel edk2 patches is also included in a edk2 bug [4] and
markd as hack.

Besides these edk changes, GOP driver is also needed. Intel never
released them to public. Even acrn hypervisor developed by intel says
"Fetch the VBT and GOP drivers from the board manufacturer". The only
way for users to get it seems to be using tools like "UEFI BIOS
Updater" to extract driver from host bios image, or try the luck by
downloading the gop driver shared on internet.

After having the GOP driver, a virtual rom for igd device in qemu
can be created by
    EfiRom -f 0x8086 -i <device_id> -e IgdAssignmentDxe.efi \
    PlatformGOPPolicy.efi IntelGopDriver.efi
IgdAssignementDxe.efi and PlatformGOPPolicy.efi are built with the
edk2 changes.

I'm not sure whether this can be added to official document.
