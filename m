Sure, and no problem about that, that's welcome!
I'm not eluding the conversation, but I just feel that as long as we 
can't really build this single-binary and share this, it's impossible 
for people to try it and make a judgment based on rationale facts about it.

Opinions and taste matter, but it's even better when we all have the 
same thing and can try solutions and post facts instead.

I agree 100% with what Thomas said.

Regarding the "Rename the binary and things should work", I was thinking 
of something like:
guess_target(argv) {
   binary=argv[0];
   if (binary.contains("qemu-system-arm")) {
     set_target(&target_info_system_arm);
   } else if (binary.contains("qemu-system-aarch64") {
     set_target(&target_info_system_aarch64);
   }
   unreachable("can't guess target from " + binary);
}

In short, detect "*qemu-system-{arch}*", with arch being one of the 
available architecture we added to the single binary.

In case someone wants to stress this piece of code by doing:
$ mv qemu-system qemu-system-arm-or-qemu-system-aarch64
Well, we can take the first occurence and call it a day.

To disambiguate a target, we can provide the -target command line 
option, and provide a QEMU_TARGET env var.

With those three ways, I hope we can cover 99.999999% of the use cases.

Anyway, we'll need to have a way to identify the target, and all the 
possible solutions will have shortcomings.
The right question is "Which solution covers the widest percentage of 
use cases ?", and my opinion is that argv[0] + -target + QEMU_TARGET env 
is the best compromise for me at this point.
I'm not keen to have a default target set, but it's a personal opinion 
based on fear of "implicit smart choice hurts", so I'll be happy to 
change my mind with a good argument for it.

Regards,
Pierrick
