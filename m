I want "a block device from this file" in a generic way that works the 
same across multiple architectures regardless of the board being 
emulated, where I only have to specify the file not explicitly 
micromanage bus plumbing details, and which is easy for a human to type 
from when explained over a voice call.

What's the alternative to -hda you suggest for that?

Can I do "./run-qemu.sh -drive file=blah.img" without the rest? Perhaps 
specify all the details in the script and then optionally add an extra 
argument at the end? I couldn't get that to work:

$ root/or1k/run-qemu.sh -netdev user,id=net0 -device 
virtio-net-device,netdev=net0 -drive format=raw,id=hd0 -device 
virtio-blk-device,drive=hd0 -drive file=README
qemu-system-or1k: -drive format=raw,id=hd0: A block device must be 
specified for "file"

Also, if you say -device and -drive but do NOT specify a file, qemu 
refuses to start. So I can't set the defaults but only optionally use 
them, the way -hda has defaults built into the image that don't cause a 
problem if I DON'T add a -hda argument to the command line.

Where the knowledge of "what this board needs in order to do that" is 
built into qemu rather than provided by the caller, yes.

I'm building a kernel. It finds /dev/?da so I can mount it. That is my 
desired outcome.

I am attempting to get generic behavior out of multiple architectures, 
among other reasons so I can cross-test and package up "it fails on X, 
here's a build and test" to point package maintainers at.

"It natively builds under the emulator" is the easiest way to make that 
work, which is why https://landley.net/bin/toolchains/latest/ has a 
native.sqf for each cross.tar.xz.

wget system-image-arch.txz
wget toolchain.sqf
wget test.img

./run-emulator.sh -hda test.img -hdb toolchain.sqf

If I have to explain "-drive virtio-potato-walrus,inkpot=striated 
-device collect=striated,burbank-potato,ireland" at somebody whose 
domain expertise is xfce or something, the barrier to getting them to 
reproduce the issue I'm seeing is noticeably higher. If I have to MAKE a 
bespoke wrapper shell script for them with every bug report, the 
likelihood that it works differently for them than when I tried it is 
noticeably nonzero, and the likelihood of the issue going on my todo 
heap and never getting pursued upstream is also noticeably higher. Which 
is why I try to make generic tools...

(Making a _test_ script to demonstrate the issue is normal. If it's 
their project, usually they can tell if I typoed it and fix it up 
themselves because they know what I MEANT. But if I typo the setup for 
the virtual environment, or are missing a prerequisite package install, 
or they hit qemu version skew, or I said /bin/sh and theirs points to 
dash... Brick wall. It either works or it doesn't.)

(And when I have to set up the long version for a nightly cron job, and 
then when the test fails 6 months later and I look at it and go "huh? 
salad?" that's a bad 3am digression as well. And which is more likely to 
break from version skew during qemu version upgrades: two lines of 
micromanaging --longopts or -hda that gets adjusted by the maintainers?)

Rob

P.S. For some reason -hda grew an "I'm going to make the first block 
read-only just like loopback devices do because you can't be trusted" 
nag a few years back, but it's mostly yet more boot spam. I can tell the 
kernel to be quiet during boot, but never figured out the equivalent for 
qemu-system...
