The orignal commit f8278c7d74c6 said

[quote]
    char-pty: remove the check for connection on write
    
    This doesn't help much compared to the 1 second poll PTY
    timer. I can't think of a use case where this would help.
[/quote]

We've now identified a use case where it is actually important.

IOW, there's a justification to revert both f7ea2038bea04628 and
f8278c7d74c6, re-adding the locking and write update logic.

With regards,
Daniel
