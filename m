Maybe fixing the qcow vs. qcow2 case could be possible relatively easily
by operating only on full words, but I don't have any fundamentally
different solution without touching every script.

If touching everything is an option, maybe we could have a standardised
comment line like we have with "# group:" today. This would be easy to
parse and work in both bash and Python scripts. But I'm not sure if it's
worth it.

Yes, I just want to have potentially surprising behaviour documented.
