Good to know!  Put it into the commit message, please.

Hmm, it's good to know for management application developers, too.  So
we should also put it into documentation, I guess.  Where?  Looking...
Oh, there's a section "Using passt as the user mode network stack"in
docs/system/devices/net.rst.  That section clearly needs an update for
the new backend.


Back to the design question how to pass configuration via qemu-system to
the passt program with this new backend.

Your patch replicates passt command line options as optional members of
QAPI type NetDevPasstOptions.  Any passt options not covered are
inaccessible.

Or rather inaccessible via QMP / HMP / CLI.  You can still access them
by pointing @passt to a wrapper script.

This leads us to a possible alternative: make such a wrapper script the
*only* way to configure passt.  This is like NetdevTapOptions @script
and @downscript.  Mind, I'm not telling you it's a good idea, I'm merely
trying to map the solution space!

Instead of trying to make NetDevPasstOptions complete (so you need to
fall back to a wrapper script only when using a version of passt with
different options), we can limit it to a curated set of options.  We'd
need to decide which ones :)

You pointed out yet another alternative: pass through the passt command
line directly.  Two obvious ways: a single shell command string to be
passed to system(3), or an array of strings to be passed to execv(3).

system(3) is a terrible idea with untrusted input, but this is trusted
input.

Any other interface ideas?

Since the backend is for human user convenience: which of these ways
would be convenient for human users?
