These would be handled by doing only a prefix match with strncmp instead 
of strcmp on argv[0].

But completely renaming is not solved even by prefix match.

I proposed before that since target (or arch because target is used in 
different senses so may be confusing) is usually tied to the board it 
could be made part of the board name. Such as ppc:g3beige or x86:pc. Then 
you can search the board list and find a match for the -machine option and 
find the arch from that. There are only a few machines that are 
problematic that behave differently based on which binary they are in and 
use different default -cpu type based on that, such as mac99 and maybe pc 
and q35 (I don't know if these x86 machines use same default cpu in 
qemu-system-i386 and qemu-system-x86_64) but those could be solved by 
deprecating this behaviour and adding different machines for each variant 
then by the time we have a single binary they would fit in this scheme.

One question is what arch to use for heterogeneous machines using multiple 
archs. Those still may have one that's considered a main arch so could be 
grouped there or we may use multi:name format for those that cannot have a 
main architecture. Or we can list them with multiple names, one for each 
arch so any of them could be used and on start to select the machine and 
the binary can check that all of the listed archs are compiled in. 
Specifying the arch for -machine would also be optional anyway unless we 
have two machines with same name but different arch which is rare.
