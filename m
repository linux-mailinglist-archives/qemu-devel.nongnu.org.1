I figured that the meaning of "partitioned" is easier to understand for
a casual user than having or not having an MBR ("I don't want to boot
from this disk, why would I care about a boot record?").

But if people think that "mbr" is better, that's fine with me.

The only thing I really didn't want is the negative "no-mbr" and the
double negation in "no-mbr=off" that comes with it.

I think in this case a conditional default makes sense, not only for
compatibility reasons. Hard disks almost always have a partition, floppy
disks with partitions are basically unheard of.
