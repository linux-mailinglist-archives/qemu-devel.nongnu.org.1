That boils down to the fact that we don't know (at the kernel level) if
we're dealing with a dasd or something else, as we're operating on the
subchannel level. We certainly don't want to deal with devices whose
(Linux) drivers do funky things with ccws, or devices where we need to
support side-channel notifications, like virtio-ccw.

"Prevent crashing" is certainly the correct first step :)

I'm not sure where we would want prevent assignment of non-dasd
devices. The kernel can't (because we're dealing with a subchannel
driver.) I think maybe management software on top of QEMU?

The other direction would be supporting things like diag500, so we could
pass through virtio-ccw devices as well. But I'm not really seeing a
use case for it, or is there one?
