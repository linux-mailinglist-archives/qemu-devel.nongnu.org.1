A big part of the reason for the macros for machine type deprecation & then
skipping machine registration, was to eliminate repeated manual work that is
visible to users if forgotten. 

We still have the actual code deletion which is manual, but that's harmless
as even if forgotten, such that the code exists, the machine type will have
been entirely removed from view.

As such I'm pretty reluctant to suggest we create a new place which needs
manually updating when we remove machine types.

I wonder if its possible to get an auto-generated version number into the
documentation though ?

eg, so we can have an entry in 'deprecated.rst'

  Versioned machine types for x86_64, i386, aarch64  <other targets here>
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  In accordance with our versioned machine type deprecation policy,
  all machine types older than 7.0.0 have been deprecated.

and in 'removed-features.rst'

  Versioned machine types for x86_64, i386, aarch64  <other targets here>
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  In accordance with our versioned machine type removal policy,
  all machine types older than 4.1.0 have been removed.


where both '7.0.0' and '4.1.0' are variables substituted in by the
docs generator in some manner, so we never need touch them manually ?

NB, this auto-deletion logic is currently hacked to only come into
effect from 10.1.0 onwards, so we're 1 cycle too early currently
(see commit c9fd2d9a48ee3c195cf83cc611b87b09f02f0013)

With regards,
Daniel
