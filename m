When doing a sync=full mirroring, QMP drive-mirror requests full
zeroing if it did not just create the destination, and blockdev-mirror
requests full zeroing unconditionally.  This is because during a full
sync, we must ensure that the portions of the disk that are not
otherwise touched by the source still read as zero upon completion.

However, in mirror_dirty_init(), we were blindly assuming that if the
destination allows punching holes, we should pre-zero the entire
image; and if it does not allow punching holes, then treat the entire
source as dirty rather than mirroring just the allocated portions of
the source.  Without the ability to punch holes, this results in the
destination file being fully allocated; and even when punching holes
is supported, it causes duplicate I/O to the portions of the
destination corresponding to chunks of the source that are allocated
but read as zero.

Smarter is to avoid the pre-zeroing pass over the destination if it
can be proved the destination already reads as zero.  Note that a
later patch will then further improve things to skip writing to the
destination for parts of the image where the source is zero; but even
with just this patch, it is possible to see a difference for any BDS
that can quickly report that it already reads as zero.

Note, however, that if the destination was opened with
"detect-zeroes": "unmap", then the user wants us to punch holes where
possible for any zeroes in the source; in that case, we are better off
doing unmap up front in bulk.
