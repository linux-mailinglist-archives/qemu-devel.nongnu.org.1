It is better to look at the Metal API instead; after all, we use ANGLE's 
Metal renderer so ANGLE can only provide features Metal allows. If 
necessary, we can use the underlying MTLTexture as this series and the 
corresponding virglrenderer change does.

Searching the Web, I found partial damage is feasible with Metal, but 
there is a complication, CAMetalLayer implements double or triple 
buffering, which complicates damage calculation. Flutter's issue for 
partial damage and its corresponding pull request details the problem 
and their solution:
https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/124526

The issue also shows the CPU usage is dramatically reduced and the 
optimization is worthwhile (though I wonder why; it is mostly GPU work 
and the CPU shouldn't be affected. Perhaps the memory bandwidth shared 
between CPU and GPU may affect the accounting).

In conclusion, partial damage is worthwhile to explore, but it should be 
done with a follow-up patch as it is not so simple that we can implement 
it by just passing the damaged area to Cocoa and Metal but it requires 
an additional logic. Keeping the initial patch small is essential for 
upstreaming.

And any optimization patch should come with some benchmark. Something 
simple is sufficient; e.g., the Flutter issue tells the CPU usage is 
dropped from 40% to 16% for "the blinking cursor in flutter gallery".
