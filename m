Yah, I did check out the blame, hence directing it at you. Thanks for
the explanation.

To be honest, benign or not, this is kind of thing is only going to
lead to grief. Even though only the direct kernel boot works, we do
actually have some customers that are using the icicle target in QEMU.

I don't know, this depends on how you see things in QEMU. I would say
that it supports c, and not Zca/Zcf/Zcd, given it predates the
extensions. I have no interest in retrofitting my devicetree stuff with
them, for example.

I think you should stop warning for this? From my dumb-user perspective,
the warning only "scares" me into thinking something is wrong, when
there isn't. I can see a use case for the warning where someone tries to
enable Zca & Co. in their QEMU incantation for a CPU that does not
have the correct privilege level to support it, but I didn't try to set
any options at all in that way, so the warnings seem unfair?

Cheers,
Conor.
