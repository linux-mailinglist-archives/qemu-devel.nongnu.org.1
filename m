 and that they can't be properly simulated in QEMU at the moment, but it se=
ems to me that's not really the point here. The point is how elastic this s=
olution can be - that is, whether to do any events or not and how exactly t=
hey should be counted should be decided by the vendor of a particular machi=
ne, and not by the simulator in general. Plus, I have a very real use case =
where it will come in handy - debugging perf. Support the possibility of si=
mulating events on QEMU side will make the life of t perf folks much easier=
. I do not insist specifically on my implementation of this solution, but I=
 think that the solution with the creation of a callback for each of the ev=
ents will significantly complicate the porting of the PMU for machine vendo=

Sure, go ahead. If you can include my first few patches that modify
the key to 64 bit
and other fixes/helpers before your patches that would be great.
