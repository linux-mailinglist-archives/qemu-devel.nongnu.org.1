Hi Luzhixing,

That's a missunderstanding. It contains no memory accesible via CXL.mem (so
host managed device memory) butit may contain memory accessible via CXL.IO etc.
Such memory is out of the scope of the CXL specification but the
intent of the text written here is to make it clear that
such memory can exist.

The name part of the SoB should be your name which I'm guessing
doesn't include numbers.

There seem to be additional changes in the text below.
I'm not sure what the purpose was?

Needs to be wrapped.

Type 2 devices are accelerators such as GP-GPUs and FPGAs with device memory that can be mapped in part to the cacheable system memory. These devices also cache system memory for processing.

Why make this change? What memory do you have that is neither persistent nor volatile?
