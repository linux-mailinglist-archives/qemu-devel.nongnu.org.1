This is an architectural issue that arises from exposing VIRTIO Shared
Memory Regions in vhost-user. It was first seen with Linux virtiofs but
it could happen with other devices and/or guest operating systems.

Any VIRTIO Shared Memory Region that can be mmapped into Linux userspace
may trigger this issue. Userspace may write(2) to an O_DIRECT file with
the mmap as the source. The vhost-user-blk device will not be able to
access the source device's VIRTIO Shared Memory Region and will fail.

If READ_/WRITE_MEM is a pain to implement (I think it is in the
vhost-user back-end, even though I've been a proponent of it), then
another way to deal with this issue is to specify that upon receiving
MAP/UNMAP messages, the vhost-user front-end must update the vhost-user
memory tables of all other vhost-user devices. That way vhost-user
devices will be able to access VIRTIO Shared Memory Regions mapped by
other devices.

Implementing this in QEMU should be much easier than implementing
READ_/WRITE_MEM support in device back-ends.

This will be slow and scale poorly but performance is only a problem for
devices that frequently MAP/UNMAP like virtiofs. Will virtio-gpu and
virtio-media use MAP/UNMAP often at runtime? They might be able to get
away with this simple solution.

I'd be happy with that. If someone wants to make virtiofs DAX faster,
they can implement READ/WRITE_MEM or another solution later, but let's
at least make things correct from the start.
