Fair point, but assigning additional meanings to the existing 'deprecation'
concept will undermine the value QEMU & its consumers obtain from current
usage.

Consumers know if they see the "deprecated" marker, it has started a clock
ticking and they must immediately plan work to stop using the feature.

QEMU maintainers know if they see the 'deprecated' marker and it has been
2 releases, then we can delete it.

I don't want to loose that clear & easily understood meaning, by overloading
"deprecated" for scenarios like "it is sometimes better to use a different
device instead of this one, depending on factors X, Y & Z".

With regards,
Daniel
