Sorry, I don't understand. Isn't executing the scheduled BH the only
additional progress that the iohandler_ctx needs to make compared to
before the patch? How exactly would that cause issues when waiting for a
BlockJob?

Or do you mean something waiting for the SnapshotJob from
qemu_aio_context before snapshot_save_job_bh had the chance to run?

Fiona
