This is connex_init() and verdex_init() in hw/arm/gumstix.c.

qtest_enabled() is *not* just suppressing a warning here, it's
suppressing a fatal error.  We use it to take a different codepath,
which is what Peter called out as a bad idea.

Comes from commit bdf921d65f8 (gumstix: Don't enforce use of -pflash for
qtest).

I don't like creating infrastructure to make bad ideas look less
obviously bad.

Having tests provide the things users need to provide feels better.  It
may not always be practical.

I guess the example above is in this camp.

This is obviously fine, and if you guys want infrastructure for that,
I'll give it a sympathetic review.

This can be fine, but it's not obviously fine.
