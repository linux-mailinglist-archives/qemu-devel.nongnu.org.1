I'll report back as i can squeeze tests between meetings (there also
is an issue with riscv emulation that I try to identify at the same
time)

For now I managed to eliminate some of my concerns, which was that it
might be my system container based setup.
But I was testing different builds on bare metal x86 this morning and
it looks the same to me.

### ### ###

1:10.0.2+ds-1ubuntu2 (this is what is in the current Ubuntu, until I
started on 10.1)

...

1:10.1.0~rc2+ds-1ubuntu1 (which has 00268e0 "i386/cpu: Warn about why
CPUID_EXT_PDCM is not available" reverted)

               ^^ this detection is already different due to using
10.1 even with the revert

               ^^ with the revert it works

more like the normal RC3)

$ virsh start testguest

error: operation failed: guest CPU doesn't match specification:
missing features: pdcm

### ### ###

While I was concerned if my test environment might have been part of
this, it seems it is generally applicable and a problem on bare metal
too.
This is on 6.16.0-13-generic on a Intel Xeon Gold 5222, libvirt 11.6,
only qemu changes between the tests.
With that confirmed, I'd indeed suggest reverting it for now, even
more if someone else could reproduce the same on other platforms and
builds.

I wanted to also double down on that former comment, trying to check
logs what they say about pdcm and pmu exactly.
pmu is easy - not mentioned ever in cmdline or configs, but pdcm is
more interesting than I expected.

This is with:
1:10.1.0~rc3+ds-2ubuntu1~questingppa1 (which is WITHOUT the revert,
more like the normal RC3)

which has "pdcm=3Don" but does not mention pmu either way.

But once qemu starts we see it emit

When I do "virsh start" after "managedsave" I see this:

I still get this warning
2025-08-20T08:54:54.477469Z qemu-system-x86_64: warning: This feature

But more interestingly - in this second start, the one with a managed
save present, we see libvirt call the guest with
   pdcm=3Doff

So for a yet unknown reason this second start is setting pdcm=3Doff and
therefore all that follows is expected.
And yep, then we will get
  error: operation failed: guest CPU doesn't match specification:
missing features: pdcm

So we are partially back to my original suspicion that is is somewhere
in between qemu and libvirt, it is neither alone but their interaction
that is breaking this AFAICS.
