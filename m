Glad it helped.  The 'x-' in the name is a giveaway that the command
is not intended for public use, but for development, it makes iotests
easier to write, so I see no reason to drop it.

This seems like an independently useful option (for any image with
embedded bitmaps, get at the contents of that bitmap).  I'm not sure
how much code you could reuse from the 'qemu-img map', or if it is
better to just write the iteration loops from scratch.  More
interesting is the observation that since NBD metacontexts are NOT
visible as a local bitmap (but rather as block status information), it
may still not do what you want for NBD connections.

Again, this would work well with local qcow2 images, but I'm not sure
if it would translate nicely into NBD client images without more code
in block/nbd.c to expose a metacontext as a bitmap rather than its
current use of feeding block status.

The other two would be hard to implement for NBD, while this one is
hard to implement for qcow2.  It might be less hacky than
x-dirty-bitmap, but also starts duplicating efforts with what nbdinfo
can already do.

If you want qemu-img to treat both qcow2 bitmaps and NBD metacontexts
transparently from the same command line, we'll definitely need some
work on how to make block/nbd.c expose an NBD metacontext as a bitmap
(separately from how the existing x-dirty-bitmap just repurposes what
is plugged into the block_status callbacks).  But handling only one
metacontext at a time, rather than having to do multiple in parallel,
is probably okay.  When you start reading more than one context at
once, you have to worry about things like the two contexts returning
different lengths of information ("base:allocation" might tell you
about a 64k hole while qemu:dirty-bitmap:XXX tells you about a 1M
dirty region - but consolidating that into contiguous extents of
combined output information is tricky, especially if you don't want to
re-query status you already know about one context but not the other).
