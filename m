One thing to keep in mind here (despite me not having any hardware to 
test) was that one of the original goals here
in the RDMA implementation was not simply raw throughput nor raw 
latency, but a lack of CPU utilization in kernel
space due to the offload. While it is entirely possible that newer 
hardware w/ TCP might compete, the significant
reductions in CPU usage in the TCP/IP stack were a big win at the time.

Just something to consider while you're doing the testing........
