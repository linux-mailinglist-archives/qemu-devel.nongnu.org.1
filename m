Broadly speaking yes. Historically we have created trouble for
ourselves (and or our users) by allowing creation of "wierd"
guest CPU models, which don't resemble those which can be found
in real world silicon. Problems specifically have been around
unsual combinations of CPUID features eg user enabled X, but not Y,
where real silicon always has X + Y enabled, and guest OS assumed
this is always the case.

So if our named CPU models can more faithfully match what you might
see in terms of cache topology in the real world, that's likely to
be a good thing.

Hmm, true, if we have direct control over cache topology, the
CPU topology is less critical. I'd still be wary of suggesting
it is a good idea to use CPU topology configs that don't reflect
something the CPU vendor has concievably used in real silicon.

Historically we preferred "sockets", when filling missing topology,
then more recently we switched to prefer "cores", since high core
counts are generally more common in real world than high socket
counts.

In theory at some point, one might want to fill in 'dies > 0' for
EPYC, or 'modules > 0' for appropriate Intel CPU models, but doing
the reverse while theoretically valid, would be wierd as no such
topology would exist in real silicon.

Ultimately if you're allowing QEMU guest vCPUs threads to float
freely across host CPUs, there is little point in setting dies/
modules/threads to a value other than 1, because the guest OS
won't benefit from understanding cache differences for dies/
modules/threads/etc, if the vCPU can be moved between host CPUs
at any time by the host OS scheduler.

Fine grained control over dies/modules/threads only makes more
sense if you have strictly pinning vCPU threads 1:1 to host CPUs

IOW, simply preferring "cores" for everything is a reasonable
default long term plan for everything, unless the specific
architecture target has no concept of "cores".

With regards,
Daniel
