It may not be necessary the case that old features are supported by 
every systems. In an extreme case, a user may migrate a VM from Linux to 
Windows, which probably doesn't support any offloading at all. A more 
convincing scenario is RSS offloading with eBPF; using eBPF requires a 
privilege so we cannot assume it is always available even on the latest 
version of Linux.

This is handled in:

"virtio-net: Convert feature properties to OnOffAuto"
https://patchew.org/QEMU/20240714-auto-v3-0-e27401aabab3@daynix.com/

I think a device which cannot conform to that rule should be 
non-migratable. For example, virtio-gpu-gl does not conform to it, and 
does not support migration either.
