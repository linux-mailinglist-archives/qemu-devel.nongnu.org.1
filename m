This is indeed exactly what I meet now. GuestMemory and QEMU's design don't
macth well! I've learned from the lessons of failure that MemoryRegion is
different from GuestMemoryRegion. Thank you for pointing the direction and
helping me decide to switch to FlatView.

I also realize that once FlatRange/FlatView is associated with GuestMemoryRegion/
GuestMemory, it changes the usual practice in QEMU, where most memory operations
are built around MemoryRegion/AddressSpace.

But that's okay because what users aware is the vm-memory interface.

Yes, there will be many gaps.

Yes, the bitmap is also a problem for me, and I also haven't figured out
how to align it with rust-vmm. In fact, in the code (that currently doesn't
run), I indeed used `()`. :-(

Is it possible or necessary for vm-memory to support overlap? Because I
feel that if it is possible, the problem might be simplified. (As a
beginner, I have yet to understand exactly how difficult it is.)
