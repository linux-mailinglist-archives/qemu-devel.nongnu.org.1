On the incoming migration side, QEMU uses a coroutine to load all the VM
states.  Inside, it may reference MigrationState on global states like
migration capabilities, parameters, error state, shared mutexes and more.

However there's nothing yet to make sure MigrationState won't get
destroyed (e.g. after migration_shutdown()).  Meanwhile there's also no API
available to remove the incoming coroutine in migration_shutdown(),
avoiding it to access the freed elements.

There's a bug report showing this can happen and crash dest QEMU when
migration is cancelled on source.

When it happens, the dest main thread is trying to cleanup everything:

  #0  qemu_aio_coroutine_enter
  #1  aio_dispatch_handler
  #2  aio_poll
  #3  monitor_cleanup
  #4  qemu_cleanup
  #5  qemu_default_main

Then it found the migration incoming coroutine, schedule it (even after
migration_shutdown()), causing crash:

  #0  __pthread_kill_implementation
  #1  __pthread_kill_internal
  #2  __GI_raise
  #3  __GI_abort
  #4  __assert_fail_base
  #5  __assert_fail
  #6  qemu_mutex_lock_impl
  #7  qemu_lockable_mutex_lock
  #8  qemu_lockable_lock
  #9  qemu_lockable_auto_lock
  #10 migrate_set_error
  #11 process_incoming_migration_co
  #12 coroutine_trampoline

To fix it, take a refcount after an incoming setup is properly done when
qmp_migrate_incoming() succeeded the 1st time.  As it's during a QMP
handler which needs BQL, it means the main loop is still alive (without
going into cleanups, which also needs BQL).

Releasing the refcount now only until the incoming migration coroutine
finished or failed.  Hence the refcount is valid for both (1) setup phase
of incoming ports, mostly IO watches (e.g. qio_channel_add_watch_full()),
and (2) the incoming coroutine itself (process_incoming_migration_co()).

Note that we can't unref in migration_incoming_state_destroy(), because
both qmp_xen_load_devices_state() and load_snapshot() will use it without
an incoming migration.  Those hold BQL so they're not prone to this issue.

PS: I suspect nobody uses Xen's command at all, as it didn't register yank,
hence AFAIU the command should crash on master when trying to unregister
yank in migration_incoming_state_destroy()..  but that's another story.

Also note that in some incoming failure cases we may not always unref the
MigrationState refcount, which is a trade-off to keep things simple.  We
could make it accurate, but it can be an overkill.  Some examples:

  - Unlike most of the rest protocols, socket_start_incoming_migration()
    may create net listener after incoming port setup sucessfully.
    It means we can't unref in migration_channel_process_incoming() as a
    generic path because socket protocol might keep using MigrationState.

  - For either socket or file, multiple IO watches might be created, it
    means logically each IO watch needs to take one refcount for
    MigrationState so as to be 100% accurate on ownership of refcount taken.

In general, we at least need per-protocol handling to make it accurate,
which can be an overkill if we know incoming failed after all.  Add a short
comment to explain that when taking the refcount in qmp_migrate_incoming().
