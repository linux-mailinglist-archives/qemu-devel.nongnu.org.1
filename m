We have some basic 128-bit support, but it isn't complete. The RISC-V
spec states:

```
The design of the RV128I base ISA is not yet complete, and while much
of the remainder of this specification is expected to apply to RV128,
this version of the document focuses only on RV32 and RV64
```

so the spec isn't finished either. AFAIK there is also no guest
software we can use for testing.

At this point there isn't really too much to do. There is some basic
support, so maybe you could try and port your OS to that? I'm not sure
how you would compile it for 128-bit support though, as I don't think
any compilers support 128-bits.

QEMU is probably not the best place to start as a beginner. Especially
the TCG side of things. It's complex code that is difficult to
understand.

On top of that, I don't think 128-bit RISC-V is a good place to start.
I don't think there is compiler support, which is going to make things
tricky.

A better bet is just to target 32-bit RISC-V micro-controllers. That
way you can test in QEMU and then think about running on actual
hardware in the future.

Your best bet is probably looking at the RISC-V issues on GitLab [1].
See if any of those are easy to fix and then submit patches
