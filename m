Hi C=C3=A9dric!

Some of our users are running into this with Proxmox VE, where they get
vfio_container_dma_map(...) =3D -22 errors, which are likely caused by
this issue of the mismatch mentioned above. Setting the guest-phys-bits
in accordance to the iommu aw-bits seems to fix that for users, e.g.
[0].

Before applying this downstream for pve-qemu, I saw that this patch was
dropped in the v3 [1], but you mentioned that this is addressed in a
later series. I couldn't find a direct follow-up in the archive, are
there any updates on this?

Thanks a lot in advance & have a nice weekend!

    Daniel
