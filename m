If VFIO used to migrate without suspension and now it won't, it's a
behavior change?

IMHO it's not about a feature being condemned, it's about a kindful
heads-up to the users that one needs to take risk on using it until it
becomes stable, it also makes developers easier because of no limitation on
behavior change.  If all the changes are landing, then there's no need for
such a patch.

If so, please propose the planned complete document patch. I had a feeling
that cpr is still not fully understood by even many developers on the list.
It'll be great that such document will contain all the details one needs to
know on the feature, etc. meaning of the name cpr-reboot (what is "cpr"),
when to use it, how to use it, how it differs from "normal" mode
(etc. lifted limitations on some devices that used to block migration?),
what is enforced (vm stop, suspension, etc.) and what is optionally offered
(VFIO, shared-mem, etc.), the expected behaviors, etc.

When send it, please copy relevant people (Alex & Cedric for VFIO, while
Markus could also be a good candidate considering the QMP involvement).

Thanks a lot,
