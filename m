I respect your personal preference, but our conversation should be based 
on arguments, and not only tastes.

The important thing, from my point of view, is that the API stays easy 
to use and clear for the user. Having multiple callbacks is a headache, 
because you can't clearly group them somewhere, and force the user to 
implement all of them at once.

By having a single callback, we can force the user to handle all cases, 
thanks to the type system. The user may decide to use "default: break;" 
and that's ok, because they chose it deliberately.

I was, and I am still ok with the current approach, of having from/to 
parameters and a "simple" callback type. But remove "from" because we 
can't get it right in some cases does not seem the best decision.

Let's try to move forward, and solve the problems we have with from_pc. 
The testing part can be solved already (as explained in a previous 
message). In which cases can't you identify from_pc?

By the way, and if you are open to talk about naming.

I understand why you picked up discontinuity, which is coming from a 
mathematical background. However, I rarely see this term used in the 
literature for computer science, and people use "exceptional control 
flow" to qualify interrupts and traps. In more, when we'll integrate 
classic control flow (including fallback between tb), the term 
discontinuity will lose its meaning. For this reason, I think that 
{cflow,CFLOW} makes more sense.

But, as there is some personal preference into this, I will leave the 
choice up to you.

Thanks,
Pierrick
