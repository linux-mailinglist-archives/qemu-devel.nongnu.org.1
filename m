Then have x-query-virtio-status return a suitable array of unsigned
numbers.  Look ma, no invention!

Syntactially invalid.  I guess you mean something like

    [{"bit": 0, "name": "VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_MUST_TELL_HOST"},
     {"bit": 9, "name": ""}]

or with optional @name

    [{"bit": 0, "name": "VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_MUST_TELL_HOST"},
     {"bit": 9}]

This is an awfully verbose encoding of an n-bit number, even if we omit
"VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_" as noise.

I could be awkward for the use case described in PATCH 1's commit
message:

    However, we sometimes want to compare features and status bits without
    caring for their exact meaning.  Say we want to verify the correctness
    of the virtio negotiation between guest, QEMU, and OVS-DPDK.  We can use
    QMP command x-query-virtio-status to retrieve vhost-user net device
    features, and the "ovs-vsctl list interface" command to retrieve
    interface features.  Without commit f3034ad71fc, we could then simply
    compare the numbers.  With this commit, we first have to map from the
    strings back to the numeric encoding.

It next describes the patch's solution:

    Revert the decoding for QMP, but keep it for HMP.

    This makes the QMP command easier to use for use cases where we
    don't need to decode, like the comparison above.  For use cases
    where we need to decode, we replace parsing undocumented strings by
    decoding virtio's well-known binary encoding.

Since this is not a stable interface, instead of a perfect (and to my
subjective self overengineered) solution at some future point, I'd
prefer to get in a simple one *now*, even if we may have to evolve it
later.
