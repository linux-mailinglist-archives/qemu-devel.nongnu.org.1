We can manually make this easier to reproduce by adding the following code to
make the destination busier to load the pages:

I think the following code:

postcopy_start() ->
	postcopy_preempt_establish_channel() ->
		qemu_sem_wait(&s->postcopy_qemufile_src_sem);

can guarantee that the connect() syscall is successful so the destination side
receives the connect() request before it loads the LISTEN command, otherwise it
won't post the sem:

postcopy_preempt_send_channel_new() ->
	postcopy_preempt_send_channel_done() ->
    		qemu_sem_post(&s->postcopy_qemufile_src_sem);

Sadly it doesn't work, there is an unknown segfault.

Per my very simple test, using post-copy preemption to live migrate an 8G VM:

    w/o this patch: 121ms in avg in 5 tries
    w/ this patch: 115ms in avg in 5 tries

So it seems the overhead introduced is not too high (maybe ignorable?).
