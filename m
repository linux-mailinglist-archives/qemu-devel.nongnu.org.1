I tend to agree with your point in that thread above. It is already
a big enough burden for maintainers to ensure that the HTML output
for their docs is rendered effectively. Adding an 'info' docs output
increases that burden for negligible benefit. HTML is the most
broadly consumable docs format, so it makes sense to focus our effort
on that.

With regards,
Daniel
