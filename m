The big problem I have with the CRB device is this code:

https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/blob/master/hw/tpm/tpm_crb.c?ref_type=heads#L297-305

It's a device that maps itself autonomously into system memory. The way 
mapping is supposed to work is that the parent of the device maps it 
into a bus region. If the parent is a machine, it is free to also map it 
into system memory. But a device should not even know what system memory 
is :).

That said, I'm happy if we just introduce a new "sane" sysdev TPM CRB 
device that we use for non-PCs and leave the current layering violating 
one as is.
