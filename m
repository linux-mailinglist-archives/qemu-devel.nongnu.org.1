But it affects the bandwidth, e.g. even with multifd enabled, the device
iteration data will still bottleneck at ~15Gbps on a common system setup
the best case, even if the hosts are 100Gbps direct connected.  Would that
be a concern in the future too, or it's known problem and it won't be fixed
anyway?

I remember Avihai used to have plan to look into similar issues, I hope
this is exactly what he is looking for.  Otherwise changing migration
protocol from time to time is cumbersome; we always need to provide a flag
to make sure old systems migrates in the old ways, new systems run the new
ways, and for such a relatively major change I'd want to double check on
how far away we can support offload VFIO iterations data to multifd.

Thanks,
