I'm still not entirely convinced that this singleton proposal is
fixing the migration problem correctly.

Based on discussions in v1, IIUC, the situation is that we have
migration_shutdown() being called from qemu_cleanup(). The former
will call object_unref(current_migration), but there may still
be background migration threads running that access 'current_migration',
and thus a potential use-after-free.

Based on what the 7th patch here does, the key difference is that
the finalize() method for MigrationState will set 'current_migration'
to NULL after free'ing it.

I don't believe that is safe.

Back to the current code, if there is a use-after-free today, that
implies that the background threads are *not* holding their own
reference on 'current_migration', allowing the object to be free'd
while they're still using it. If they held their own reference then
the object_unref in migration_shutdown would not have any use after
free risk.

The new code is not changing the ref counting done by any threads.
Therefore if there's a use-after-free in existing code, AFAICT, the
same use-after-free *must* still exist in the current code.

The 7th patch only fixes the use-after-free, *if and only if* the
background thread tries to access 'current_migration', /after/
finalize as completed. The use-after-free in this case, has been
turned into a NULL pointer reference.

A background thread could be accessing the 'current_migration' pointer
*concurrently* with the finalize method executing though. In this case
we still have a use after free problem, only the time window in which
it exists has been narrowed a little.

Shouldn't the problem with migration be solved by every migration thread
holding a reference on current_migration, that the thread releases when
it exits, such that MigrationState is only finalized once every thread
has exited ? That would not require any join() synchronization point.

With regards,
Daniel
