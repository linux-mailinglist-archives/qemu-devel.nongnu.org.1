That's not logically possible.

In both (1) and (2) you are issuing a read() call to the TLS channel.

The first read call(s) consume all incoming data. Only once the underlying
TCP socket read() returns 0, would GNUTLS  see that it hasn't got any
TLS "bye" packet, and thus return GNUTLS_E_PREMATURE_TERMINATION from
the layered TLS read(). IOW, if you see GNUTLS_E_PREMATURE_TERMINATION
you know you have already read all received data off the socket.

Daniel
