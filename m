Ouch, I didn't notice that..  Ok that's a fair request then!

When looking (trying to fill up the whilelist for 8.2 machine type on
"esp"), I found one more thing. See:

commit b46a43a2241476d13486e016a0809b690b65f90e
Author: Mark Cave-Ayland <mark.cave-ayland@ilande.co.uk>
Date:   Fri Jan 12 12:53:48 2024 +0000

    esp.c: remove unused PDMA callback implementation
    
    Note that this is a migration break for the q800 machine because the extra PDMA
    information is no longer included.

It deliberately wants to break migration.  That might be a problem now
since it means it'll reliably fail the vmstate checker CI test, then
people'll say "this is expected", then should the maintainer merge such
change?  As long as merged, everything running the vmstate checker will
fail it always.

Maybe we'll need to add another whiltelist to ignore some devices?  It
gets a bit hairy..
