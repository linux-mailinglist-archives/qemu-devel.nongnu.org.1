What to do with the duplicated HVA is an added problem that deserves
more discussion, right. If a duplicated entry gets deleted, the other
one should take its place in both trees.

Store them in an ordered list and look for replacements on tree
deletion maybe? It would be great to locate a similar usage and see
what is done there.
