It doesn't:

1) the strict feature check will be only enabled in new machine types
2) if kernel ABI is stable, qemu will keep working after upgrading
kernel even with strict check otherwise it would be a bug of kernel

So I don't see it breaking anything if we make it start to work at 11.0?

Peter has given the example of how hard we can define gracefulness
(e.g migrate from a kernel w/ USO to a kernel w/o USO) and fix.

Maybe we can think of a usersapce fallback to emulation of USO or
others, but I'm not sure if it's an overkill.

It's the first step as it's much better than silently clearing the
feature which may confuse both user and migration. We can use warnings
instead of errors but I'm not sure how much it can help.

Mostly, it should work as a CPU cluster. So it's the responsibility of
the management layer, maybe we can develop some tool to report this or
via qemu introspection ("query-tap" ?). Or if the management can do
this now, we don't even need to bother (or it can help to uncover
bugs). Anyhow, clearing a feature silently is not good and can cover
bugs of various layers.

Note that this issue is not specific to TAP, we may meet this for
vDPA/VFIO live migration as well. Basically, it should be the
responsibility of the management layer to deal with those migration
compatibility policies instead of using hard coded policies inside
Qemu. For qemu, it can simply error out when there's a mismatch
between features that are supported and features that are asked to
enable. We've suffered a lot in the past when trying to deal with this
by Qemu.
