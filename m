* One of my machines does seem to support 'avx*' instructions. QEMU is
configured and built with the 'avx2' and 'avx512bw' support. Still
migration-tests run fine, without any hang issue observed. Not sure
why the hang issue is not reproducing on my side. How do you generally
build QEMU to run these tests?  Does this issue require some specific
h/w setup/support?

* Not sure how/why page faults happen during the Multifd phase when
the guest on the destination is not running. If 'receivedmap' says
that page is present, code accessing guest memory should just access
whatever is available/present in that space, without waiting. I'll try
to see what zero pages do, how page-faults occur during postcopy and
how they are serviced. Let's see..

* Another suggestion is, maybe we should review and pull at least the
refactoring patches so that in the next revisions we don't have to
redo them. We can hold back the "enable multifd and postcopy together"
patch that causes this guest hang issue to surface.

* ie. ignore everything after - "There's also other issues with this
series: " ?  OR just the last one " ...with TLS channels..." ??
Postcopy tests are added only if (env->has_uffd) check returns true.

Thank you.
