If we make intent explicit with DEFINE_INTERNAL_PROP_FOO(), is repeating
intent in the name useful?

This is fine for device properties now.  It's not fine for properties of
user-creatable objects, because these are defined in QAPI, and QAPI
prohibits names starting with a single underscore.  I append relevant
parts of docs/devel/qapi-code-gen.rst for your convenience.

Why does QAPI prohibit leading underscores?  Chiefly because such names
are reserved identifiers in C.  Instead of complicating the mapping from
QAPI name to C identifier, we restrict QAPI names and call it a day.

The mapping between device property name and C identifiers is entirely
manual.  When a property is backed by a member of the device state
struct, naming the member exactly like the property makes sense.  Having
to mentally strip / insert a leading underscore would hardly be
terrible, just a bit of friction.  I'd prefer not to.




Naming rules and reserved names
-------------------------------

All names must begin with a letter, and contain only ASCII letters,
digits, hyphen, and underscore.  There are two exceptions: enum values
may start with a digit, and names that are downstream extensions (see
section `Downstream extensions`_) start with underscore.

Names beginning with ``q_`` are reserved for the generator, which uses
them for munging QMP names that resemble C keywords or other
problematic strings.  For example, a member named ``default`` in qapi
becomes ``q_default`` in the generated C code.

[...]

Downstream extensions
---------------------

QAPI schema names that are externally visible, say in the Client JSON
Protocol, need to be managed with care.  Names starting with a
downstream prefix of the form __RFQDN_ are reserved for the downstream
who controls the valid, reverse fully qualified domain name RFQDN.
RFQDN may only contain ASCII letters, digits, hyphen and period.

Example: Red Hat, Inc. controls redhat.com, and may therefore add a
downstream command ``__com.redhat_drive-mirror``.
