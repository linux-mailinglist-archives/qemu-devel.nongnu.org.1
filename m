Agree, it doesn't make sense to have both. My only concern now is
related to riscv_iommu_fault() and riscv_iommu_pri() updating related
queue CSR and interrupt status register (REG_IPSR). Other than that it
should be ok to rely on BQL.

Thanks for bringing up this comment. Yes, definitely makes sense, it
will add latency (what I've found beneficial for driver side testing).
Both solutions have downsides. I'll have a closer look if the
consequences for ATS/PRI processing are severe enough to move back to
the threading model. Let's leave as is for now.

Thanks!
