> Theory of operation
> -------------------
> 
> The multifd channels operate in parallel with the main migration
> thread. The transfer of data from a client code into multifd happens
> from the main migration thread using the multifd API.
> 
> The interaction between the client code and the multifd channels
> happens in the multifd_send() and multifd_recv() methods. These are
> reponsible for selecting the next idle channel and making the shared
> data structure containing the payload accessible to that channel. The
> client code receives back an empty object which it then uses for the
> next iteration of data transfer.
> 
> The selection of idle channels is simply a round-robin over the idle
> channels (!p->pending_job). Channels wait at a semaphore, once a
> channel is released, it starts operating on the data immediately.
> 
> Aside from eventually transmitting the data over the underlying
> QIOChannel, a channel's operation also includes calling back to the
> client code at pre-determined points to allow for client-specific
> handling such as data transformation (e.g. compression), creation of
> the packet header and arranging the data into iovs (struct
> iovec). Iovs are the type of data on which the QIOChannel operates.
> 
> Client code (migration thread):
> 1. Populate shared structure with opaque data (ram pages, device state)
> 2. Call multifd_send()
>     2a. Loop over the channels until one is idle
>     2b. Switch pointers between client data and channel data
>     2c. Release channel semaphore
> 3. Receive back empty object
> 4. Repeat
> 
> Multifd channel (multifd thread):
> 1. Channel idle
> 2. Gets released by multifd_send()
> 3. Call multifd_ops methods to fill iov
>     3a. Compression may happen
>     3b. Zero page detection may happen
>     3c. Packet is written
>     3d. iov is written
> 4. Pass iov into QIOChannel for transferring
> 5. Repeat
> 
> The destination side operates similarly but with multifd_recv(),
> decompression instead of compression, etc. One important aspect is
> that when receiving the data, the iov will contain host virtual
> addresses, so guest memory is written to directly from multifd
> threads.
> 
> About flags
> -----------
> The main thread orchestrates the migration by issuing control flags on
> the migration stream (QEMU_VM_*).
> 
> The main memory is migrated by ram.c and includes specific control
> flags that are also put on the main migration stream
> (RAM_SAVE_FLAG_*).
> 
> Multifd has its own set of MULTIFD_FLAGs that are included into each
> packet. These may inform about properties such as the compression
> algorithm used if the data is compressed.
> 
> Synchronization
> ---------------
> 
> Since the migration process is iterative due to RAM dirty tracking, it
> is necessary to invalidate data that is no longer current (e.g. due to
> the source VM touching the page). This is done by having a
> synchronization point triggered by the migration thread at key points
> during the migration. Data that's received after the synchronization
> point is allowed to overwrite data received prior to that point.
> 
> To perform the synchronization, multifd provides the
> multifd_send_sync_main() and multifd_recv_sync_main() helpers. These
> are called whenever the client code whishes to ensure that all data
> sent previously has now been received by the destination.
> 
> The synchronization process involves performing a flush of the
> ramaining client data still left to be transmitted and issuing a
> multifd packet containing the MULTIFD_FLAG_SYNC flag. This flag
> informs the receiving end that it should finish reading the data and
> wait for a synchronization point.
> 
> To complete the sync, the main migration stream issues a
> RAM_SAVE_FLAG_MULTIFD_FLUSH flag. When that flag is received by the
> destination, it ensures all of its channels have seen the
> MULTIFD_FLAG_SYNC and moves them to an idle state.
> 
> The client code can then continue with a second round of data by
> issuing multifd_send() once again.
> 
> The synchronization process also ensures that internal synchronization
> happens, i.e. between each thread. This is necessary to avoid threads
> lagging behind sending or receiving when the migration approaches
> completion.
> 
> The mapped-ram feature has different synchronization requirements
> because it's an asynchronous migration (source and destination not
> migrating at the same time). For that feature, only the internal sync
> is relevant.
> 
> Data transformation
> -------------------
> 
> Each multifd channel executes a set of callbacks before transmitting
> the data. These callbacks allow the client code to alter the data
> format right before sending and after receiving.
> 
> Since the object of the RAM migration is always the memory page and
> the only processing done for memory pages is zero page detection,
> which is already part of compression in a sense, the multifd_ops
> functions are mutually exclusively divided into compression and
> no-compression.
> 
> The migration without compression (i.e. regular ram migration) has a
> further specificity as mentioned of possibly doing zero page detection
> (see zero-page-detection migration parameter). This consists of
> sending all pages to multifd and letting the detection of a zero page
> happen in the multifd channels instead of doing it beforehand on the
> main migration thread as it was done in the past.
> 
> Code structure
> --------------
> 
> Multifd code is divided into:
> 
> The main file containing the core routines
> 
> - multifd.c
> 
> RAM migration
> 
> - multifd-nocomp.c (nocomp, for "no compression")
> - multifd-zero-page.c
> - ram.c (also involved in non-multifd migrations + snapshots)
> 
> Compressors
> 
> - multifd-uadk.c
> - multifd-qatzip.c
> - multifd-zlib.c
