Hi Markus,

> Jie Song, Marc-André, is this bug serious enough and the fix safe enough
> to still go into 10.2?

First, regarding the seriousness of this bug, although the probability of encountering 
it in a production environment is relatively low, it has existed for quite some time.

Secondly, with regard to the safety of this fix, it has been verified successfully
in the test environment. However, it would be better if more people could help to
review it to further ensure its robustness.
