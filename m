There are a few that the dest will still need set explicitly. Specifically
the TLS parameters - tls-authz and tls-creds, because those are both
related to --object parameters configured on the dst QEMU. Potentially
there's an argument to be made for the TLS parameters to be part fo the
initial 'migrate' and 'migrate-incoming' command data, as they're
specifically related to the connection establishment, while (most) of
the other params are related to the migration protocol running inside
the connection.

A few other parameters are also related to the connection establishment,
most notably the enablement multifd, postcopy and postcopy-pre-empt.

I think with those ones we don't need to set them on the src either.
With the new migration handshake we should probably use multifd
codepaths unconditionally, with a single channel. By matching with
the introduction of new protocol, we have a nice point against which
to deprecate the old non-multifd codepaths. We'll need to keep the
non-multifd code around *alot* longer than the normal deprecation
cycle though, as we need mig to/from very old QEMUs.

The enablement of postcopy could be automatic too - src & dst can
both detect if their host OS supports it. That would make all
migrations post-copy capable. The mgmt app just needs to trigger
the switch to post-copy mode *if* they want to use it.

Likewise we can just always assume postcopy-pre-empt is available.

I think 'return-path' becomes another one we can just assume too.

With regards,
Daniel
