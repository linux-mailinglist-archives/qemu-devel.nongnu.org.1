Do you mean QEMU versions here ? The non-migratable feature list is
just hardcoded in QEMU right now, and there's only 1 of them.
eg grep for 'unmigratable_flags'

Note, that "migratable" property is not defining a general purpose
migration mask between different hw generations. It was specifically
blocking just stuff that is known to make migration impossible, even
if HW is identical on both sides.

The impression I get (as an distant observer) is that CPUs on s390x in
general have less complexity to worry about. A combination of not having
a vendor who creates loads off different SKUs for the same CPU model
family with slight variations between each, and also not seeming to have
a situation where CPU flags a known to disappear (or appear) arbitrarily
in microcode updates.

The s390x idea of a "migratable" and "non migratable" model for each
HW generation is a nice simplification, but I can't see how it could
be made to work for x86 when you can't predict ahead of time what
features are going to be removed from existing HW definition by the
next microcode update, or by the next CPU SKU that removes a feature
you had assumed would always be present in a given HW generation.

I don't know much about how ARM world works, but having lots of vendors
competing with their own custom impls makes me worry complexity will
be closer to x86 than to s390.

If the ARM specifications define a minimum require featureset for each
HW generation, maybe you can define a model based on that ? You might
still want to have vendor specific models though, if there are compelling
features they expose which are optional, or non-standardized. 

With regards,
Daniel
