My favorite tool for Rust development is rust-analyzer, which works very 
well with cargo-based projects. Making it work with meson is just a 
matter of pointing rust-analyzer to the rust-project.json file generated 
by meson at configuration time (just like compile_commands.json).

Unfortunately, rust-analyzer also relies on cargo for doing its check. I 
was able to override that with ninja, but it requires `meson setup` with 
`RUSTFLAGS="--emit=metadata --error-format=json"`. That makes 
rust-analyzer happy, but compilation output is not readable anymore 
being json-like.

I ended up working with 2 build folders, one for me, one for 
rust-analyzer. So, yeah, it complicates a bit.
