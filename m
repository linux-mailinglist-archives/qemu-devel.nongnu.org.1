Gotcha! Thanks for the feedback. I would *prefer* that code checked in to
qemu.git use the QMP module where possible so that I don't have to maintain
multiple copies of QMP wrangling code. I think what you want to do should
be easily possible with the existing library; and anything that isn't, I'm
more than happy to meet your needs. Reach out absolutely any time.

I might *suggest* you try to use the exception-raising interface and catch
exceptions to interrogate expected errors as it aligns better with the
"idiomatic python API" - I have no plans to support an external API that
*returns* error objects except via the exception class. This approach will
be easier to port when I drop the legacy interface in the future, see below=
.

But, that said, whichever is easiest. We use all three interfaces in many
places in the QEMU tree. I have no grounds to require you to use a specific
one ;)

I named it legacy to be scary on purpose :)

The truth is that the "legacy" module was designed to be a 1:1 drop-in
replacement for an older version of the synchronous QMP library that
powered our internal iotests. We still use this "legacy" module in
thousands of places in the QEMU tree. I do have plans to replace it with a
"proper" synchronous frontend class, eventually, someday, etc. It's been a
while and I still haven't done it, though. Oops...

When I do eventually replace it, I will convert all users inside of
qemu.git personally, and the design of the "non-legacy" API will be chosen
pretty explicitly to make that task really easy for myself and reviewers.
This would include your script inside the qemu.git tree. It should be
pretty safe to use the legacy module *in qemu.git*, but for external,
out-of-tree scripts, it may indeed disappear someday - but converting to
the new API, when I merge it, should be very, very trivial. How much of a
headache that is for you depends on how you package/distribute the script
and how awful it will be to update the code and dependencies when it
happens.

FYI: I have promised in the readme for the standalone version of qemu.qmp
that legacy.py will not be removed prior to v0.1.0. All versions before
then will still have it, guaranteed.

(Neither here nor there: One of the holdups in this replacement is figuring
out how to structure the API for event listening, which was the main
motivator of the *async* version of the class. We have many users who don't
want full async handling, but still want to listen for and catch events. I
need a proper sit and think for what the API I want to commit to supporting
and maintaining for this should look like. Not your problem, anyway!)

I&#39;ll take a look. The name &quot;legacy&quot; is a little scary, as it =
might<br>
imply that this has been deprecated. If there&#39;s no plans to deprecate,<=
br>
then it would be great to use it and simplify the code a little bit.<br></b=
lockquote><div><br></div><div>I named it legacy to be scary on purpose :)</=
div><div><br></div><div>The truth is that the &quot;legacy&quot; module was=
 designed to be a 1:1 drop-in replacement for an older version of the synch=
ronous QMP library that powered our internal iotests. We still use this &qu=
ot;legacy&quot; module in thousands of places in the QEMU tree. I do have p=
lans to replace it with a &quot;proper&quot; synchronous frontend class, ev=
entually, someday, etc. It&#39;s been a while and I still haven&#39;t done =
it, though. Oops...<br></div><div><br></div><div>When I do eventually repla=
ce it, I will convert all users inside of qemu.git personally, and the desi=
gn of the &quot;non-legacy&quot; API will be chosen pretty explicitly to ma=
ke that task really easy for myself and reviewers. This would include your =
script inside the qemu.git tree. It should be pretty safe to use the legacy=
 module *in qemu.git*, but for external, out-of-tree scripts, it may indeed=
 disappear someday - but converting to the new API, when I merge it, should=
 be very, very trivial. How much of a headache that is for you depends on h=
ow you package/distribute the script and how awful it will be to update the=
 code and dependencies when it happens.</div><div><br></div><div>FYI: I hav=
e promised in the readme for the standalone version of qemu.qmp that legacy=
.py will not be removed prior to v0.1.0. All versions before then will stil=
l have it, guaranteed.</div><div><br></div><div>(Neither here nor there: On=
e of the holdups in this replacement is figuring out how to structure the A=
PI for event listening, which was the main motivator of the *async* version=
 of the class. We have many users who don&#39;t want full async handling, b=
ut still want to listen for and catch events. I need a proper sit and think=
 for what the API I want to commit to supporting and maintaining for this s=
hould look like. Not your problem, anyway!)<br></div><div>=C2=A0</div><bloc=

<br>
&gt; There&#39;s also an async version, but it doesn&#39;t look like you re=
quire that<br>
&gt; complexity, so you can ignore it.<br>
<br>
Yes, that&#39;s the case: a serialized sync send/response logic works perfe=
ctly<br>
for this script. No need to be burden with asyncio complexity.<br>
