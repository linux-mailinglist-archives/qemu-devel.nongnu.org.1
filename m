Looks like they may have finally fixed the issue in gitlab. They have
previously blocked cleanup on all repositories older than a certain
date

Cleanup stops the container usage growing without bound, but switching
to Kaniko will still double our long term storage usage which is pretty
undesirable IMHO.
