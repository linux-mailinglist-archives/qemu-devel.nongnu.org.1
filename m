Add more information with CXL type1 and type2 devices.

Original doc says "May also have device private memory accessible 
via means such as PCI memory reads and writes to BARs.", but actually
CXL type1 devices doesn't have device memory.

 --------------------
 CXL 2.0 End Points are often categorized into three types.
 
-**Type 1:** These support coherent caching of host memory.  Example might
-be a crypto accelerators.  May also have device private memory accessible
-via means such as PCI memory reads and writes to BARs.
+**Type 1: Accelerators without device memory**. These support coherent caching of host memory. Example might be a crypto accelerators or smart NICs that use coherency semantics along with PCIe-style DMA transfers. Type1 devices implement a fully coherent cache but no host-managed device memory.
 
-**Type 2:** These support coherent caching of host memory and host
-managed device memory (HDM) for which the coherency protocol is managed
-by the host. This is a complex topic, so for more information on CXL
-coherency see the CXL 2.0 specification.
+**Type 2: Accelerators with device memory**. These support coherent caching of host memory and host managed device memory (HDM) for which the coherency protocol is managed by the host. Type 2 devices are accelerators such as GP-GPUs and FPGAs with device memory that can be mapped in part to the cacheable system memory. These devices also cache system memory for processing.
 
-**Type 3 Memory devices:**  These devices act as a means of attaching
-additional memory (HDM) to a CXL host including both volatile and
-persistent memory. The CXL topology may support interleaving across a
-number of Type 3 memory devices using HDM Decoders in the host, host
-bridge, switch upstream port and endpoints.
+**Type 3: Memory devices**. These devices act as a means of attaching
+additional memory (HDM) to a CXL host with different memory types, including supporting multiple memory tiers attached to the device with both volatile and persistent memory. The CXL topology may support interleaving across a number of Type 3 memory devices using HDM Decoders in the host, host bridge, switch upstream port and endpoints.
