* It does. migration_ioc_process_incoming() is called for each
incoming connection. And every time it calls
migration_should_start_incoming() to check if it should proceed with
the migration or should wait for further connections, because multifd
does not start until all its connections are established.

* Similarly when the Postcopy channel is initiated towards the end of
Precopy migration, migration_should_start_incoming() gets called, and
returns 'false' because we don't want to start a new incoming
migration at that time. Earlier it was receiving boolean value
'default_channel' as parameter, which was set to false while accepting
'postcopy' connection via => default_channel = !mis->from_src_file;

* Okay, will try to fix it better.  But calling
migration_has_all_channels() after checking migrate_multifd() does not
seem/read right.

* There are no changes related to that. As this series only tries to
enable the multifd and postcopy options together.

* Right. I have tested this series with the following migration
commands to confirm that migration works as expected and there were no
crash(es) observed.

* Thank you for the hints about the tests, will surely look into them
and try to learn about how to add new test cases.

Thank you.
