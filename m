That's how I interpret it, but I'll defer to a profile spec author, or
at least to somebody more confident of their spec interpretation skills.

Ah, now I think I understand the concern. The new names might as well be
ignored because the absence of the names in the hardware descriptions is
ambiguous. I guess I'd encourage software that has a role in advertising
features to use the new names when it has detected the feature or assumes
the feature is present (and presumably wouldn't be running if its
assumption was wrong). If, for example, Linux puts a new name in
/proc/cpuinfo after detecting or assuming the feature's presence, then it
no longer matters that the hardware description had it or not from the
perspective of the /proc/cpuinfo consumer (assuming they're aware of which
kernel version they need). With these types of fixups and enough time,
then hopefully most of the software ecosystem will able to live in
ignorant bliss.

From QEMU's perspective, they can. Linux or whatever software consuming
the hardware descriptions may want to distrust the absence of newly
named feature extensions and do their own checks, but that's not QEMU's
concern. Actually, being able to disable these newly named features allows
Linux and other software to test how they behave when the feature goes
away. Do they crash fast and clean or do they go off in the weeds? Does
their ad hoc detection actually work?

Thanks,
