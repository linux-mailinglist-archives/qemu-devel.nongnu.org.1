The latter statement is accurate. In the libvirt case, this info ends up
in the per-VM logfile, which is one of the key files humans look at first
when triaging any QEMU related bug reports.

I don't think that's correct. The mgmt app can decide the missing features
don't matter, but at the same time someone looking at the QEMU command line
doesn't know the mgmt apps' intent and it is easy to overlook that QEMU will
silently drop features. So the precense of the warnings in the log alerts the
person debugging that the actual QEMU guest visible CPU is subtly different
from what's on the command line, and that's useful IMHO for troubleshooting.
