Conventional wisdom holds that in migration scenarios, we must have the option
to fall back to the source if the target fails.  In all the above, I point out
the reasons behind this wisdom, and that many of those reasons do not apply
for cpr-exec.

No question, bugs are a risk and will occur.

Will do.

I will rebase and post it after receiving all comments for V3.
I think we are almost there.

It is not related to cpr-exec.  It is related to hot plug, for any migration
type scenario, so it does not fit in the cpr-exec docs.
