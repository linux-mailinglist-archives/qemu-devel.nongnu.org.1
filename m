Hm, alright. I think I'll just stub out conditionals with a TODO and circle
back to how I'll handle them; I need to do a pass on ifcond handling in
general, so I guess I'll get to it then. I still think it's a little weird,
but you don't, and you're the QAPI guy ;)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If you want to outlaw conditional special features, rejec=

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; make it stand out in git-log.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Do you advocate this? I wasn&#39;t sure what it *meant* for a=
 special feature<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; to be conditional; I couldn&#39;t conceive of what it meant t=
o have an ifcond<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; for &quot;deprecated&quot; or &quot;unstable&quot;, for insta=
nce. It sounds like it isn&#39;t well<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; defined, but we happen to not expressly forbid it.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Semantics are clear enough to me.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &quot;Conditional special feature&quot; combines &quot;conditional=
 feature&quot; (which is a<br>
&gt;&gt; special case of conditional thing) with special feature (which is =
a<br>
&gt;&gt; special case of feature).<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; The QAPI schema language supports compile-time conditionals for ce=
rtain<br>
&gt;&gt; things.=C2=A0 Generated code behaves as if the thing didn&#39;t ex=
ist unless its<br>
&gt;&gt; condition is true.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; QAPI schema features are strings exposed to clients in introspecti=
on.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Combine the two: a conditional feature is exposed if and only if i=
ts<br>
&gt;&gt; condition is true.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Existing uses: dynamic-auto-read-only if CONFIG_POSIX, fdset if<br=
>
&gt;&gt; CONFIG_BLKIO_VHOST_VDPA_FD.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; A special feature is a feature that has special meaning to the<br>
&gt;&gt; generator, i.e. we generate different code in places when it&#39;s=
 present.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Combine: we enable different code for a conditional special featur=
e only<br>
&gt;&gt; when its condition is true.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; No existing uses so far.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Implementation is straightforward, too.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Mechanically, it&#39;s well defined... but that isn&#39;t my concern.<=
br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; What I asked you was: &quot;what would it mean for deprecated to be co=
nditional?&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Without understanding that, I have no chance to design a system that<b=
r>
&gt; handles that information accordingly for the documentation.<br>
<br>
Special feature deprecated means the use of the thing that has it is<br>
deprecated with this particular qemu-system-FOO.<br>
<br>
Why &quot;this particular&quot;?=C2=A0 Because it wasn&#39;t deprecated in =
some prior<br>
version of QEMU.=C2=A0 Features (special or not) are always, always about t=
he<br>
specific qemu-system-FOO binary you&#39;re talking to via QMP.<br>
<br>
Conditionals are compile-time schema configuration.=C2=A0 Either the<br>
condition is true or not at compile time.=C2=A0 If it&#39;s true, the thing=
 that<br>
has it is there, else it isn&#39;t.<br>
<br>
Now combine the two.=C2=A0 If the condition of special feature &#39;depreca=
te&#39; is<br>
true, the thing that has it is deprecated with this particular<br>
qemu-system-FOO.=C2=A0 Else it isn&#39;t.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Any code we generate for a conditional thing is guarded by #if<br>
&gt;&gt; ... #endif.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; For features, we generate suitable data into qapi-introspect.c.<br=
>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; For special features, we generate a little additional code here an=
d<br>
&gt;&gt; there; look for .is_special() to find it.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Bug: this additional code lacks #if ... #endif.=C2=A0 Simple overs=
ight,<br>
&gt;&gt; should be easy enough to fix.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I guard against it here because, similarly, I have no idea ho=
w to handle<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; the case where it&#39;s true.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t realize we technically allow it, though ... woul=
d you like me to<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; move to expressly forbid it in the parser? (Failing that, I h=
ave no idea<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; how to display this information otherwise, so I&#39;d need yo=
u to sketch<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; something out for me; so my inclination is to forbid it as yo=
u suggest.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Future developers can always lift the restriction once they h=
ave some<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; use-case in mind and a plan for how to display that informati=
on.)<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I think we should first make a reasonable effort at figuring out h=
ow to<br>
&gt;&gt; handle conditional special features.=C2=A0 If we fail, we can add =
the<br>
&gt;&gt; restriction instead.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I don&#39;t think I agree; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth spending t=
ime defining a<br>
&gt; feature we don&#39;t use in our minds to then design around a hypothet=
ical<br>
&gt; future use.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Easier to admit we don&#39;t use it and save defining the semantics fo=
r the<br>
&gt; future developer who stumbles across a reason for needing it.<br>
<br>
Semantics of &quot;apply conditional to feature&quot; don&#39;t need defini=
ng, because<br>
they are simply the same as &quot;apply conditional to any other thing.&quo=
t;<br>
When you have a definition for the general case that works for all the<br>
special cases, then outlawing one special case *increases* complexity.<br>
That&#39;s why I&#39;m reluctant.<br>
<br>
I figure your actual problem more concrete than &quot;what does it even<br>
mean?&quot;, namely how to present conditionals in generated documentation.=
<br>
In that context, features *may* differ from any other thing!<br>
<br>
Aside: the (mostly generated) QMP introspection is about this particular<br=
>
qemu-system-FOO, like all of QMP, whereas the (mostly generated) QMP<br>
documentation is about any qemu-system-FOO that could be built from this<br=
>
particular working tree.=C2=A0 May lead to doc generation problems that hav=
e<br>
no match elsewhere.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; How do you handle features in general, and special features in<br>
&gt;&gt; particular?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Features: they go in the :feat: field list.<br>
&gt; Special features: they go in the :feat: field list, and also receive a=
<br>
&gt; special option flag to the directive to allow for special rendering of=
 the<br>
&gt; &quot;signature bar&quot; (the header line for a given entity definiti=
on in the<br>
&gt; rendered documentation.)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; e.g.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; @deprecated will generate two things:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 1) the definition block will get a :deprecated: option, which enables =
the<br>
&gt; html renderer to (potentially) do special things like color the entry<=
br>
&gt; differently, add a &quot;warning pip&quot;/eyecatch, etc. It&#39;s sco=
ped to the whole<br>
&gt; definition.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 2) A :feat deprecated: line which is added to the features &quot;field=
 list&quot; as<br>
&gt; per normal for features.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; How do you handle conditionals in general?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; In this series, I don&#39;t!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ...except for top-level conditionals, which are currently passed as-is=
 as<br>
&gt; an argument to the :ifcond: directive option. The format of that argum=
ent<br>
&gt; and what the HTML renderer actually does with it is currently TBD.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; (In current prototypes I just print the conditional string in the sign=
ature<br>
&gt; bar.)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; How do you combine feature and conditional?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Notably TBD. Unhandled both in this series as-is *and* in my larger WI=
P.<br>
<br>
How do you combine definition and conditional?=C2=A0 You answered that righ=
t<br>
above: largely TBD.<br>
<br>
How do you combine enum value / object type member / command argument /<br>
event argument and conditional?=C2=A0 Also answered right above: not yet.<b=
r>
<br>
What does that mean for the doc generator code?=C2=A0 Does it simply ignore=
<br>
conditionals there?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; How could you combine special feature and conditonal?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Bewilderingly uncertain.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Mechanically, it *could* be handled the same way :ifcond: directive op=
tions<br>
&gt; are.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; e.g.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ```<br>
&gt; .. qapi:command:: x-beware-of-the-leopard<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 :deprecated: {ifcond stuff here}<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 :unstable: {ifcond stuff here}<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 lorem ipsum dolor sit amet<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 :feat deprecated: blah blah (if: ...)<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 :feat unstable: blah blah (if: ...)<br>
&gt; ```<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Semantically and in the rendered output, I have absolutely no clue<br>
&gt; whatsoever; and doubt I could figure it out without a use case in fron=
t of<br>
&gt; me to design around ... so I&#39;d prefer to put up a traffic barrier =
for now.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; i.o.w. the design issue arises specifically because special features a=
re<br>
&gt; semanticaly special and are &quot;hoisted&quot; to be block-level in t=
he<br>
&gt; transmogrified rST doc, and so syntax needs to be designed, implemente=
d and<br>
&gt; tested if they are to be conditional.<br>
<br>
You choose to make them special in the documentation.=C2=A0 They haven&#39;=
t been<br>
special there so far.=C2=A0 I&#39;m not telling you not to, I&#39;m just po=
inting out<br>
this is a problem we elect to have :)<br>
<br>
&gt; Yet, we have no such cases to facilitate the design, implementation an=
d<br>
&gt; testing.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; So, I&#39;d like to prohibit until such time as we have such a case.<b=
r>
<br>
I believe what you need isn&#39;t so much an explanation of semantics, it&#=
39;s<br>
use cases.=C2=A0 And that&#39;s fair!<br>
<br>
Let me offer two.<br>
<br>
1. Imagine we&#39;re trying to develop something big &amp; complex enough t=
o<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0make keeping it out of tree until done impractical.=C2=A0 We f=
eel even an<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0in-tree branch would be impractical.=C2=A0 Instead, we commit =
it to<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0master, default off, configure --enable-complex-thing to get i=
t.=C2=A0 Not<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0exactly something we do all the time, but not outlandish, eith=
er.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0Further imagine that the big &amp; complex thing will involve =
some new<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0QMP commands replacing existing ones.=C2=A0 As usual, we want =
to mark the<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0ones being replaced deprecated, so we can remove them after a =
grace<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0period.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0But simply deprecating them in the schema would be premature!=
=C2=A0 The<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0big &amp; complex thing may fail, and if it does, we rip it ou=
t.=C2=A0 If it<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0succeeds, we enable it unconditionally.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0We can express what we&#39;re doing by making feature deprecat=
ed<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0conditional on CONFIG_COMPLEX_THING, which is defined by<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0--enable-complex-thing.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0That way, the complex thing doesn&#39;t affect the QMP interfa=
ce unless<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0we enable it.=C2=A0 Good.=C2=A0 And if we enable it, we do get=
 the deprecation,<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0and can test management applications cope with it.<br>
<br>
2. Imagine we turned allow-preconfig into a special feature.=C2=A0 Further<=
br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0imagine some whole-stack feature requires a certain command to=
 have<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0allow-preconfig, and you got tasked with implementing it.=C2=
=A0 Which you<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0duly did, to everybody&#39;s satisfaction.=C2=A0 It is now day=
s to the<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0release, rc4 has sailed, and some dude comes out of the woodwo=
rk to<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0report the command crashes in preconfig state.=C2=A0 Weird!=C2=
=A0 It worked<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0*fine* in your meticulous testing.=C2=A0 After some back and f=
orth, you<br>
