Alright. The addition of Marshallers was done in the last
interaction. Before, I had the following for command and similar
to event:

    func MarshalCommand(c Command) ([]byte, error)=20
    func UnmarshalCommand(data []byte) (Command, error)

Each of this series iterations had a more or less a different
idea of how the consumer of this generated code would use it, but
without a proper PoC on top, like you've done here and thanks for
that.

I'm happy with the suggestions and I'll incorporate them.

Just want to put emphasis that the module that we will maintain
would still be considered alpha/unstable until we get the library
in a state we agree is good.

Yeah, plus what Markus said. Choosing qapi/qemu/900 should stay
working as long as QMP would guarantee (end of grace period of a
breaking change).

I'd consider sane Applications to bump the go module when they
bump the minimum required QEMU version for their supported use
case, to be able to handle new events and changes.

Thanks again,
