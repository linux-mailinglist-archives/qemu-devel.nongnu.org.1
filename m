What is the actual signal you are seeing that impacts QEMU
in this way ?

It is incredibly arbitrary where we use RETRY_ON_EINTR, which I think
points towards it being a sub-optimal solution to the general problem.

For user mode emulation isn't it valid to just propagage the
EINTR back up to the application, since EINTR is a valid errno
they have to be willing to handle unless the app has itself
use SA_RESTART.
