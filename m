ha, that's how KVM works if I recall it right, one doesn't need host/max fo=
r it,
flip to host's vendor would happen with _any_ cpumodel.
That's leads to some degree of fun on guest OS side to deal with.

given host/max are accelerator specific models with all possible features f=
or it,
it' would be fair to make sure that those models in qemu-system-i686 case e=
xpose
only 32-bit CPU's features
(do we wanna go to that extent for i386? I'm not sure)

However let's not confuse it with capabilities of specific machine type,
it shouldn't have any influence on cpu models. It looks like this patch does
the right thing /limiting permitted cpus to back then reality/.

If we strictly follow rules,
then deprecation is the way to go, so it wouldn't look as regression.

(aka QEMU used to start fine with host/max, and we warn in advance that it's
going out in favor of .../because of ...
shout out if you have a use case.)
