* I thought that major overhaul of the channel discovery part by
moving it to channel.c was to be done subsequently, no? As we
discussed, we need to touch the channel discovery parts in
'migration_ioc_process_incoming' because, we need to identify the
Postcopy channel when its connection comes in. So the Patch-2 does
minimal changes that are _required_ to enable the two (multifd &
postcopy) features together.

* Whereas, moving channel discovery parts out to connections.c could
be done separately with its own reasoning that - we are moving it
outside to connection.c because it fits better there.

* I think we (you, me, Peter) are all looking at things differently.
    - In my view Patch-2 is the minimal change _required_  to enable
multifd & postcopy. In your view we are _revamping_ channel discovery
parts while _sneaking_ in a feature of enabling multifd & postcopy
together.
    - In my view Patch-5 in this series is an isolated change because
it adds a new migration command to allow multifd threads sync from
source side. But Peter thinks without that 'flush and sync' Patch-2 is
incomplete, so we should merge it back there.

* I've also shared my view about not trying to do everything in this
one series. I don't know how do we move forward from here. I'm also
not sure what the final _acceptable_ patch-set should look like. I
thought a tested working patch-set is a good start. At this point I
think I'll just follow your lead.

* How exactly do we want to divide patch-2 to move channel discovery
parts to channel.c?
===
     if (!migration_has_main_and_multifd_channels()) {
     }
     ...
     } else {
        channel = CH_MAIN;
    }
===
Do we move this entire if - else - else block to channel.c from
migration_ioc_process_incoming() ?

* Okay. Does it hang indefinitely or for brief moments?

Thank you.
