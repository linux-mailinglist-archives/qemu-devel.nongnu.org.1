So I did some quick debugging and realized that I had a wrong
understanding of how fids relates to opened files on the host, under QEMU.
It turns out that in QEMU's 9p server implementation, a fid does not
actually correspond to any opened file descriptors - it merely represents
a (string-based) path that QEMU stores internally.  It only opens the
actual file if the client actually does an T(l)open, which is in fact
separate from acquiring the fid with T(l)walk.  The reason why renaming
file/dirs from the client doesn't break those fids is because QEMU will
actually fix those paths when a rename request is processed - c.f.
v9fs_fix_fid_paths [1].

It turns out that even if a guest process opens the file with O_PATH, that
file descriptor does not cause an actual Topen, and therefore QEMU does
not open the file on the host, and later on reopening that fd with another
mode (via e.g. open("/proc/self/fd/...", O_RDONLY)) will fail if the file
has moved on the host without QEMU's knowledge.  Also, openat will fail if
provided with a dir fd that "points" to a moved directory, regardless of
whether the fd is opened with O_PATH or not, since path walk in QEMU is
completely string-based and does not actually issue openat on the host fs
[2].

I'm not sure if this was is intentional in QEMU - it would seem to me that
a fid should translate to a fd (maybe opened with just O_PATH) on the
host, and path walks based on that fid should be done via openat with this
fd, which will also "automatically" handle renames without QEMU needing to
fixup the string paths?

In any case, this probably means that even if Landlock were to hold a fid
reference, and QEMU does qid remapping, that's still not enough to
guarantees that we won't have a different, unrelated file ending up with
the same qid, at least under ext4.

I'm not sure what's the way forward - would Landlock need to actually
"open" the files (or do something that will cause a Topen to be issued by
v9fs)?  Alternatively if we believe this to be a QEMU issue, maybe
Landlock don't need to work around it and should just hold fids (and use
QIDs to key the rules) anyway despite server quirks like these.  This can
perhaps then be fixed in QEMU?

(I guess the fact that QEMU is doing path tracking in the first place does
gives more precedent for justifying doing path tracking in v9fs as well,
but maybe that's the wrong way to think about it)
