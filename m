I'm glad it was that simple - I'm not aware of any incompatibilities, and I
did test with a bunch of guest OSes including a few Linux versions,
FreeBSD, Win10, and macOS.

Regarding your question about kvm-unit-tests: Last time I checked, the
upstream version of its APIC tests crashed Qemu on hvf (and I think also
TCG,) with or without any of the patches in this patch set applied. The
reason is that one of the test cases assumes it's running on a hypervisor
supporting a KVM-specific hypercall, i.e. it assumes it's running on KVM. I
tried submitting a patch that tests for support of that hypercall at
runtime, but it didn't get merged at the time:
https://marc.info/?l=3Dkvm&m=3D169736751712535&w=3D2
I should update that to make sure it applies correctly to the latest
upstream and re-submit it, as those unit tests are actually extremely
useful for development & debugging.

If the patch no longer applies correctly, you can also just disable the
test_pv_ipi() test by whatever means you like.

Patch 1/5 obviously(?) allows the x2apic tests to run at all, while patch
4/5 fixes some of the failures in test_apicbase() and test_enable_x2apic().
There are still a significant number of test failures remaining, but these
equally apply to TCG and aren't specific to these hvf patches. (Of course
it would be nice to fix them, but I've been spending a lot of time and
energy on the PV Graphics and vmapple patch set=E2=80=A6 hopefully that wil=
l
eventually be merged and I might get a chance to get some of the other
small improvements I've got lying around into an upstreamable state.)

All the best,
Phil
