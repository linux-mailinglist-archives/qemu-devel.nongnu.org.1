Since all the macros defined in CONFIG_DEVICES are poisoned by
exec/poison.h, which *is* included by qemu/osdep.h, target-independent
files never need to include CONFIG_DEVICES.  My question was strictly
about target-dependent files, i.e. exactly the ones that include
CONFIG_TARGET.

I agree it's a bit odd for device code to check whether some other
device is also selected for the current target.

But is it odd for the QAPI schema to define a device-specific command
only when the device is selected?

Is accidental use of a macro from CONFIG_DEVICES a risk?  Is the risk
mitigated to some useful degree by having to include CONFIG_DEVICES?

I consider the combination of testing configuration symbols with #ifdef
and requiring a manual #include to actually get the symbols (and make
the #ifdef work) bad practice.

Options:

1. Approximate symbols from CONFIG_DEVICES with symbols from
   CONFIG_TARGET.  This is what we do now.

2. Use symbols from CONFIG_DEVICES.  Generated headers are no longer
   self-contained.  Strong dislike.

3. Define device-specific stuff unconditionally.  We get to fool around
   with stubs, binaries carry more useless code, and introspection
   becomes less useful.  Meh.

Thoughts?
