Postcopy still heavily affects the performance of the VM for the whole
duration, and afaiu that's so far the major issue (after we fix postcopy
interruptions with recovery capability) that postcopy may not be wanted in
many cases.

If I am the admin I'd want it to run at full speed even if the pages were
not directly requested just to shrink the duration of postcopy; I'd just
want to make sure requested pages are queued sooner.

But that's okay if any of us still thinks that three values would be
helpful here, because we can simply have the latter two having the same
value when we want.  Three is the superset of two anyway.

I see you used "convergance" explicitly even after PeterM's reply, is that
what you prefer over "convergence"?  I do see more occurances of
"convergence" as a word in migration context, though.  Any better name you
can come up with, before I just go with "max-convergence-bandwidth" (I
really cannot come up with anything better than this or available-bandwidth
for now)?

Thanks,
