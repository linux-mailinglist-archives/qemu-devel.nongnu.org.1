I'm not saying the 64MB alignment is not correct (I don't know what is 
correct and assuming the Xorg driver was tested with real cards it's 
possible this assumption holds) but maybe it comes from having a 64MB VRAM 
BAR that contains twice the size of actual VRAM including the AGP window 
which also satisfies the 32MB alignment for VRAM, so the commit message 
may nees to be adjusted to say that instead of something not supported by 
documentation. Do you have any PCI cards? There were PCI versions of 
these. I wonder if they also have the same VRAM BAR. If not then no 
problem, we can go with what works for known drivers.

BALATON Zoltan
