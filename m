Hi Peter,

This is great to hear! I=E2=80=99m happy you=E2=80=99re taking the time=
 to propose and
mentor this. I=E2=80=99m definitely interested in seeing what comes out=
 of it,
thanks for putting me in the loop.

Regarding your proposed Fast Snapshot Load, it=E2=80=99s certainly more=
 widely
applicable and doesn=E2=80=99t require new QMP commands or extensive co=
nfigurations
(beyond mapped-ram), compared to what I had in mind. I think it will be
beneficial for our use case regardless.

I=E2=80=99d still be interested in trying to improve it further using d=
irty
tracking at some point, to ignore pages that haven=E2=80=99t been writt=
en between
two loadvm of the same snapshot. This would probably apply only to lega=
cy
snapshot though, as file migration expects a clean QEMU process.

I=E2=80=99m not sure if I=E2=80=99m still eligible for GSoC; otherwise,=
 I would have
applied myself :)

Best,
Marco
