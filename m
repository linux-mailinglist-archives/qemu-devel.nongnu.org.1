This all looks similar to when I posted it before.  However I noted a

Plus there was a third rather more fundamental problem that apparently
I didn't write about.  That is that connections were serialised on a
single thread (called from many coroutines).  This bottleneck meant
that there wasn't very much advantage to multi-conn, compared to what
we get in libnbd / nbdcopy.

Are these fixed / planned to be fixed, especially the third?
