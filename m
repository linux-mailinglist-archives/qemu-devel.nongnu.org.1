When you're down in the weeds on a given piece of code it might
not occurr that it could be used in a constructor.

The biggest usage is QOM type registration, which we've obviously
been careful (lucky) enough to keep safe.

The other common use if initializing global mutexes.

I rather wish our mutex APIs supported a static initializer
like you get with pthreads and/or glib mutexes. That would
have avoided this ordernig problem.

Probably not, but I can't be that confident as I have not auditted
all constructors.

I accidentally created a problem myself by putting an error_report
call into the rcu constructor to debug something never realized
that would result in pain.

And then I put error_report into the RCU thread itself and thus
discovered that was running concurrently with other constructors.

Indeed, that was my thought when discovernig this :-(

I spent a little time wondering if we could replace coroutine_mon with
a "__thread Monitor cur' and then update that in monitor_set_cur, but
I couldn't convince myself it would be entirely safe. So for sake of
getting the series done I took this approach and left the current
monitor stuff for another day.
