Thanks for your comment anyway!

During the years, my brute force approach to solve issues like this has been
to locally patch qemu source code to build custom qemu binaries with the
smb.conf parameters that I want.

Such a script would be easier to modify than changing the C sources.

During the years, I have also seen the need to use alternative smbd. I have
then solved it by having the old smbd that I prefered for qemu in /usr/sbin
and moved the "original" smbd provided by the Linux distribution to
/usr/local/sbin where it has been started by any real Samba servers in the
network.

Yes, by specifying such a script on the command line it would be possible to
have different parameters for different qemu sessions.  However, I think that
also my solution allowing settings of samba parameters fixes most of the
problems in a way which most of the times will be easier to use. 

Usually, there is no need to modify more than a handfull of parameters so
those extra arguments to the qemu command line will be less to write than a
separate script starting samba. In my experience qemu is mostly started from a
script with a rather long qemu command line anyway.

The remaining problem is when Samba comes with a new version which requires
new settings of parameters. Regardless of solution some script will need to be
modified to solve that problem.

Again, thanks for your comment! I hope that someone will consider my patch or
your suggestion. The next thing to look into would be the possibility to start
some userspace NFS daemon as an alternative to Samba as Unix-guests works
better with NFS than CIFS. However, that would be a much bigger project and I
won't dig into such a thing until I have gotten any response on this small
patch.

regards Henrik
