Sorry if I gave that feeling; it's more of a stronger willingness to at
some point enable shmem for QEMU migration, rather than wanting to push
back what Nicholas was trying to do.  Enabling more arch for migration
tests is definitely worthwhile on its own.

Shmem is just some blank spot that IMHO we should start to think about
better coverarge. E.g. it is the only sane way to boot the VM that is able
to do fast qemu upgrades using ignore-shared, that was true even before
Steve's cpr-exec work, which would be much easier than anonymous. And it's
also possible shmem can be (in the next 3-5 years) the 1G page provider to
replace hugetlb for postcopy's sake - this one is far beyond our current
discussion so I won't extend..

IMHO shmem should just be a major backend just like anonymous, and the only
possible file backend we can test in CI - as hugetlb is harder to manage
there.

Looks like ivshmem-test only uses 1MB shmem constantly so probably that
will succeed if the migration test will, but true they face the same
challenge and they interfere with each other..  that test sidently pass
(instead of skip) if mktempshm() fails.  I guess we don't have a way to
solidly test shmem as shmem simply may not be around.

For this patch alone personally I'd avoid using "use_uffd_memfile" as the
name, as that's definitely confusing, since shmem can be tested in other
setups too without uffd.  Nicolas, please feel free to move ahead with your
arch enablement series with /tmp if you want to separate the shmem issue.

Thanks,
