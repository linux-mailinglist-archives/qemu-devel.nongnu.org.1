Looks like I'm going through my post-vacation review backlog in

Yes, please.

The QAPI schema's primary purpose is to define the QMP interface.  The
tooling lets you define QAPI types that aren't actually used in the QMP
interface.  We use this intentionally, e.g. to generate types & visitors
for complex QOM properties.  Accidental use is also possible, say when
we define a type unconditionally, but use it only conditionally.  We
then end up generating dead code.  No big deal, but let's avoid it
whenever practical.
