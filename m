Downloading data from gitlab API is painfully slow so not something
you want to do regularly/repeatedly.

If we can have the script to download the data and save it locally,
we could then do something like populate a sqllite DB with pipeline
results which can we efficiently query to extract failure patterns.
I guess this script at least starts us moving in that direction by
giving us the framework to fetch data, and build on that...

With regards,
Daniel
