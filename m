Take my answer with a grain of salt, but this is how I read it..

Then when snapshots load/save, it operates on the disks with the block
qiochannel in the BH context. IIUC it has its own internal processing via
the block layer code, and at least when reaching, taking load as example,
bdrv_readv_vmstate(), there must be a coroutine context.

Then in proper places of the block/ code it'll yield() when needed, so that
monitor fds can still be polled, and when active monitor code can still run.

I feel like you have a better understanding of block/ than me.  Correct me
if something was wrong!

Yeah I don't have a strong feeling on this one, I just preferred to be
explicit for now, before I get a better grasp of what if I don't.

Firstly, if you see I found at least one spot where tls_bql_locked might
report wrong things (when waiting on a condvar; I sent that patch
elsewhere).  So I have concern on what if it goes wrong and we add more
dependency to this code, even if in our case it's still manageable (what I
did currently).

OTOH, I also prefer explicit knowledge of who took the BQL whenever
possible, instead of knowing "BQL is taken, but I don't know who took it".
BQL_LOCK_GUARD() is very handy, it's handy enough to not even need to know
the answer of 2nd question.  The parameter can still let the migration code
be BQL-aware on which layer took it, and then when we know exactly when we
could either (1) remove a BQL_LOCK_GUARD use or (2) convert that to
bql_lock() when we know all contexts changed so BQL was never held.

Let me know if you think otherwise.  I'm open to opinions.

I believe it was just a laziness when developing 6720c2b32725.  AFAIU, we
could do better with simiilar qio_channel_yield() / qio_channel_wait()
handling like what we do elsewhere.  Here it's a peek but it's essentially
a same read request, it's just that it doesn't move the needle.

I will prepare a pre-requisite patch remove the sleep.

I think qemu_coroutine_yield() should at least need it.

My very limited understanding is the coroutines running in the main thread
must yield with bql held, otherwise all coroutines share the same
tls_bql_locked (which is a thread var) and it doesn't look right that bql
status could ever change after switching back to a coroutine which used to
hold bql.

Heh, I believe we need bql here, thanks for catching it.  Logically I
should test this path, but you know..

I'll directly use bql_lock() / bql_unlock() here, because we explicitly
know we don't have bql.

Yes I believe the setter and here all needs bql, so race free.

I'm not sure if we will not need it before this series, but we'll at least
start to need it now? After this series, process_incoming_migration_co()
becomes migration_incoming_thread(), which will not hold bql
anymore.. while many of process_incoming_migration_bh() does need bql?

Indeed. I would expect there's no real difference because this already
means migration failed.. however I agree it's also not my intention to
explicitly change the ordering, but pretty much an oversight.
