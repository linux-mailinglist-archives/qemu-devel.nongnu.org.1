Presumably this re-opening of VCPU FDs means that all  the KVM vCPU PIDs
are going to change ?

If so, this is a significant semantic change that will break management
applications. vCPU PIDs are exposed in QMP and applications like libvirt
query them upon QEMU startup *BEFORE* vCPUs are started, and then do
things like setting CPU pinning or NUMA policies against them.

They cannot re-query the vCPU PIDs at time of reset, as by that point QEMU
has been running guest code, and so mgmt applications must assume that the
QEMU process (and thus QMP replies) are hostile. They cannot trust the vCPU
PIDs that would be reported as QEMU might have been compromised and now be
reporting vCPU PIDs of a completely different process as a form of DoS
against the mgmt app.

Can we get this reset functionality into KVM natively instead so QEMU
doesn't have todo this dance to re-create everything ? 

With regards,
Daniel
