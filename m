+CC EDK2 list and Gerd.

Still not a thorough report but some breadcrumbs.

May be something about my local build setup as the shipped EDK2 succeeds,
but the one I'm building via
uefi-tools/edk2-build.sh armvirtqemu64
(some aged instructions here that are more or less working still)
https://people.kernel.org/jic23/

Indeed starts out with some alignment faults.

Gerd, any ideas?  Maybe I needs something subtly different in my
edk2 build?  I've not looked at this bit of the qemu infrastructure
before - is there a document on how that image is built?
As Richard observed, EDK2 isn't the simplest thing to build - I've
been using uefitools for this for a long time, so maybe I missed some
new requirement?

Build machine is x86_64 ubuntu, gcc 12.2.0.

I need to build it because of some necessary tweaks to debug a
PCI enumeration issue in Linux. (these tests were without those
tweaks)

As Richard observed, most of the command line isn't needed.

qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt,virtualization=3Dtrue, -m 4g -cpu cortex-a76 \
-bios QEMU_EFI.fd -d int
