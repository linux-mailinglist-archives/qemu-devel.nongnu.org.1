OK, I think I got that now.

That does not seem to be better than the current version.

Agreed. As long as it's not more broken than it is already, i.e. the 
current behaviour is preserved, that should be good enough but I'm not a 
maintainer who has a word in this so that's just my opinion. Then maybe 
you could add a comment when the global variable needs to be set to NULL 
to note that this may not be the correct way and some hint of the above 
that this may need fixing later. I think we don't have a graphics 
maintainer at the moment who has time to look at this so then at least 
leave a comment to help whoever comes later who wants to fix this 
eventually.
