The point is libvirt can explicitly set "on" to avoid the "auto" 
behavior. libvirt does not have to use the "auto" value.

libvirt can still use "auto" if desired. virDomainNetDefParseXMLDriver() 
in libvirt actually parses tristate values (libvirt uses "default" 
instead of "auto" as the mnemonic) for these features though "default" 
is currently disabled by the schema (src/conf/schemas/domaincommon.rng). 
Allowing user to specify "default" is only a matter of editing the 
schema. Of course specifying "default" will make the VM unsafe for 
migration.
