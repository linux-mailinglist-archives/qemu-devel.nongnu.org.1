That's somewhat misleading, because as the diffstat below shows,
this is indeed bringing new C++ source files into QEMU:

   contrib/plugins/cpp.cpp                     | 119 ++++++++++++++++++++

and the description above talks about bringing more C++ plugins in
from external forks, and the meson.build files are modified to
deal with C++.

We've had a handful of C++ files historically we've worked to
reduce, with the eventual goal of not using a C++ toolchain for
any part of QEMU build. Given that IMHO qemu.git should not be
adding new C++ sources files, even if in the plugins dir.

Since the qemu-plugin.h file should be entirely self-contained,
do we actually need to be bundling all the plugins into qemu.git ?

Should we in fact have a sepate gitlab.com/qemu/qemu-plugins repository
where we keep plugins ?

Since the qemu-plugin.h file is defining a somewhat stable API, plugins
in that separate repo ought to be able to build against multiple QEMU
releases, and could thus benefit from not being bundled together and
don't need to be on the same release cycle.

The main qemu.git CI jobs could trigger testing of a separate
qemu-plugins.git repo, so we still validate no regressions.

With regards,
Daniel
