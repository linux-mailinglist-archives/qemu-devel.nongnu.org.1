I just ran into a similar crash and could reproduce it with
5005aed8a7e7 alpha-linux-user as follows:

#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/shm.h>

int main(void)
{
        shmat(shmget(IPC_PRIVATE, 1836016, IPC_CREAT | 0600), (void *)0x20000804000, 0);
        open("/proc/self/maps", O_RDONLY);
}

Apparently an mmap() is missing for shmat() when g>h and shmaddr is
specified. The mismatch between the host's and the guest's view of the
mapping's tail appears to be causing the SEGV.
