Double is actually just the initial case. The cache is storing layers
using docker tags, whose name appears based on a hash of the "RUN"
command.

IOW, the first time we build a container we have double the usage.
When a dockerfile is updated changing a 'RUN' command, we now have
triple the storage usage for cache. Update the RUN command again,
and we now have quadruple the storage. etc.

Kaniko does not appear to purge cache entries itself, and will rely
on something else to do the cache purging.

GitLab has support for purging old docker tags, but I'm not an
admin on the QEMU project namespace, so can't tell if it can be
enabled or not ? Many older projects have this permanently disabled
due to historical compat issues in gitlab after they introduced the
feature.

With regards,
Daniel
