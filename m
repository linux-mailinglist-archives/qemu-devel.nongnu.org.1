Yes, maybe I didn't explain myself clearly, I believe we share the view.

My point was we shouldn't introduce special QMP commands to do set()s just
to work similiarly as what machine versioning / compat properties do.

I hope we will start to have something like query-platform soon.  Jason and
Michael have some discussion here, which should be discussing similar
concept:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/CACGkMEtdxWJygVbcuvER5yj13R0JL_bxPSAg0eYyiBeh=SyRXg@mail.gmail.com/

Maybe USO can be a start point for us doing this, allowing mgmt to probe
host features.

Thanks,
