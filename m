Dongli,

Thanks for your feedback. Sure, I would add you into the mail loop when
sending the qemu mediated vPMU patches.

BTW, I found Xiaoyao ever sent a quite familiar patch
(https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20220317135913.2166202-10-xiaoyao.li@intel.com/)
and he has updated the patch to latest qemu code base, I would pick up his
patch directly.

Thanks,

Dapeng Mi
