I wonders how this part works in Vladimir's use case.

How does cpr-exec guarantees everything will go smoothly with no failure
after the exec?  Essentially, this is Vladimir's question 1.  Feel free to
answer there, because there's also question 2 (which we used to cover some
but maybe not as much).

The other thing I don't remember if we discussed, on how cpr-exec manages
device hotplugs. Say, what happens if there are devices hot plugged (via
QMP) then cpr-exec migration happens?

Does cpr-exec cmdline needs to convert all QMP hot-plugged devices into
cmdlines and append them?  How to guarantee src/dst device topology match
exactly the same with the new cmdline?
