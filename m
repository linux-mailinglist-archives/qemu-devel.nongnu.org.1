Theoretically yes: we can pass same fds to the target. We'll still need some new option, to avoid
some operations with TAP on initialization (as when we initialize it on target, source is still running,
and TAP should work on source), but that's possible.

Still, at least in our case, making an additional migration state looks more straightforward.

1. Management layer doesn't store these fds. And its not simple to store them in our architecture,
as management layer just doesn't live as long as QEMU, it's being restarted more often.

2. So, we'll need to add interfaces to get all these fds from QEMU, and than pass them to the target
QEMU.

So, it's a lot simpler for QEMU to care about these fds. QEMU owns them, why not to pass them through
migration stream?

Also, that's not a precedent of passing fds (which are not visible to the guest) through migration
channel, see docs/devel/migration/CPR.rst.

(Hmm, I missed that Steve recently resent his "[RFC V2 0/8] Live update: tap and vhost", which
transfers TAP fds through CPR state.. I still think, using one migration channel is quite
possible and more convenient. But that's a topic to discuss on corresponding series, and this
one is just a refactoring, which just make the code more readable)
