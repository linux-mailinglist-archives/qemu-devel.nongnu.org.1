Ah. too bad.

I meant at the "HW" board level in QEMU.

We can not instantiate the TPM I2C chip device model in the tacoma-bmc
machine init routine and attach it to the I2C bus because of the required
TPM backend. This means that the device is necessarily defined on the QEMU
command line and this makes the ast2600-evb and tacoma-bmc machine very
similar in terms of HW definitions.

Hmm, did you copy the rainier-bmc machine definition ?

Keeping the tacoma-bmc machine is fine if there is a use for it. Testing
the TPM I2C device driver is certainly a good use but we should reflect
that in QEMU also (so that we don't forget). Could we change the test in
machine_aspeed.py to use the tacoma-bmc machine instead ? and revert the
deprecation patch of course.

Thanks,

C.
