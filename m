Sorry for the delayed response, it seems I missed the email reply for 
some reason during the long weekend.

Hmmm, this scheme will only work if the aliased map doesn't go away 
immediately. If the BQL is not held or an unmap is to be done out of RCU 
critical section, it's pretty dangerous to assume we can be always fine 
to work with the other overlapped regions. In my opinion if we have to 
work with the HVA tree, it'd be ideal for the caller(s) to get more aid 
in helping figure out the right IOVA range in match rather than for SVQ 
or vhost-iova-tree to blindly pick a random one or break up contiguous 
range into pieces (in an inconsistent and unnecessary way). This would 
require a bit extensive changes to all the callers to pass in more 
information though, like the GPA, or the RAMBlock/MemoryRegionSection 
backing the relevant guest memory, along with the offset.

Yes, if there's no easy way out we have to add this extra info to the 
HVA tree and make the lookup routine even complex (or duplicative).

Yeah I see why you prefer working with HVA tree even with overlapping 
ranges, as the current API virtqueue_map_desc() that returns the HVA 
already wraps up the translation internals well for e.g. when span over 
different IOMMU.  Are you worry with the vIOMMU case where the GPA is no 
longer cached in the virtqueue elem? Maybe we can add also that 
information to the elem even for vIOMMU (we can defer doing it until we 
add the vIOMMU support to SVQ), so that SVQ can just look up the GPA 
tree directly in the translation path?

Sure, understood. I just want to compare the Pros and Cons for each 
candidate, so that Jonah won't spend quite a lot of time to come up with 
complicated code, then soon find out all or most of them have to be 
thrown away, due to short sighted design which is unable to cope with 
foreseeable future use cases.
