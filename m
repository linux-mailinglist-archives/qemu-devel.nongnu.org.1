Yes, but there are still some points to figure out, as Peter mentioned,
such as how to handle capabilities for which there is a high chance that
libvirt does actually want to control, e.g. multifd. One approach is to
just continue to allow migrate-set-caps before qmp-migrate and take
those into account during handshake as well.

I'm putting together a prototype that we can iterate on. I'll let you
know as soon as I have something I can share.
