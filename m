Indeed, we experience this error at migration from older QEMU versions to
the QEMU 10.1


$ virsh migrate --unsafe --live test-migration qemu+ssh://10.105.100.188/sy=
stem
error: operation failed: guest CPU doesn't match specification:
missing features: pdcm,arch-capabilities

The domain definition used to reproduce this issue is quite simple:

<domain type=3D'kvm' xmlns:qemu=3D'http://libvirt.org/schemas/domain/qemu/1=
.0'>
  <name>test-migration</name>
  <memory unit=3D'GiB'>2</memory>
  <os>
    <type arch=3D'x86_64' machine=3D'q35'>hvm</type>
  </os>
  <cpu mode=3D'host-model' check=3D'partial'/>
</domain>

Here are the -machine and -cpu blocks of QEMU command-lines for a
migration between
QEMU 9.2 and QEMU 10.1 on a Intel Haswell CPU:

Origin: QEMU 9.2

...

This migration failure can be broken down to 2 separate issues, each
one is related to one missing feature: pdcm & arch-capabilities.
Based on our best understanding of the moment, the behavior of QEMU on
these 2 features has been changed recently in 10.1.

- arch-capabilities

  https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/d3a24134e37d57abd3e7445842cda2717f49e=
96d
  (target/i386: do not expose ARCH_CAPABILITIES on AMD CPU)

- pdcm
  https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/e68ec2980901c8e7f948f3305770962806c53=
f0b
  (i386/cpu: Move adjustment of CPUID_EXT_PDCM before
feature_dependencies[] check)

  this commit makes QEMU disable the pdcm if PMU is off, I think on
previous QEMU versions,
  this is also the expected behavior but there is a bug that is fixed
in the commit.
  When I enable the PMU in the guest definition:
    <features>
    <pmu state=3D'on'/>
    </features>
  The missing pdcm feature error disappears.

If we revert both these two commits, the migration works.

We are looking into potential solutions to this migration issue and
according to the documenation [1],
our failure might fall into the 4th case:
  $ qemu-7.2 -M pc-7.2 -> qemu-8.0 -M pc-7.2

Presumably, it is necessary to add some compability properties to make
the new behavior on pdcm and
arch-capabilities compatible with older QEMU versions, but as Christian sai=
d -
10.1 is already released so it might be more complex now

## Other failed combinations

We looked into all the failing migration combinations we might have in
our supported releases.
We can confirm that the migration is also broken for other QEMU
versions we support in various Ubuntu releases:
(F =3D Focal, J =3D Jammy, N =3D Noble, P =3D Plucky, Q =3D Questing)

F-4.2 -> Q-10.1
J-6.2 -> Q-10.1
N-8.2 -> Q-10.1
P-9.2 -> Q-10.1

Maybe worth to note that these combinations are tested by our
automated tests and they just leave
cpu unspecified allowing libvirt to pick safe defaults instead of
using host-model as shown in the sample
domain definition above.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; # Problem<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What I found when testing migrations in Ubuntu w=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 error: operation failed: guest CPU =

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is behaving the same with libvirt 11.4 or t=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But switching back to qemu 10.0 confirmed that t=
his behavior is new<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with qemu 10.1-rc.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Without yet having any hard evidence against the=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; related commits between 10.0 and 10.1-rc1:<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; # Caveat<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My test environment is in LXD system containers,=
 that gives me issues<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the power management detection<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 libvirtd[406]: error from service: =

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; That&#39;s harmless.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Yeah, it always was for me - thanks for confirming.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And the resulting host-model on a=C2=A0 rather o=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Which is odd as it should only add a warning right?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; No, that commit message is misleading.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; IIUC mark_unavailable_features() actively blocks usage of th=
e feature,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; so it is a functional change, not merely a emitting warning.=
<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It makes me wonder if that commit was actually intended to b=

&gt; &gt; We can revert the commit.=C2=A0 I&#39;ll send the revert to Stefa=

&gt; &gt; decide whether to include it in 10.1-rc4 or delay to 10.2 and 10.=

&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks Paolo for considering that.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; My steps to reproduce seemed really clear and are 100% reproducible<br=

&gt; for me, but no one so far said &quot;yeah they see it too&quot;, so I&=
#39;m getting<br>
&gt; unsure if it was not tried by anyone else or if there is more to it<br=
>
&gt; than we yet know.<br>
&gt; Further I tested more with the commit reverted, and found that at<br>
&gt; least cross version migrations (9.2 -&gt; 10.1) still have issues that=
<br>
&gt; seem related - complaining about pdcm as missing feature.<br>
&gt; But that was in a log of a test system that went away and ... you know=
<br>
&gt; how these things can sometimes be, that new result is not yet very<br>
&gt; reliable.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I intended to check the following matrix more deeply again with and<br=
>
&gt; without the reverted change and then come back to this thread:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; #1 Compare platforms<br>
&gt; - Migrating between non containerized hosts to verify if they are<br>
&gt; affected as well<br>
&gt; - Power management explicitly switched off/on (vs the auto detect of<b=
r>
&gt; host-model) in the guest XML<br>
&gt; #2 Retest the different Use-cases I&#39;ve seen this pop up<br>
&gt; - 10.1 managed save (broken unless reverting the commit that was ident=
ified)<br>
&gt; - 9.2 -&gt; 10.1 migration (seems broken even with the revert)<br>
<br>
I need to come back to this aspect of it - the cross release or cross<br>
qemu version migrations.<br>
<br>
Hector (on CC) helps me on that now - sadly we were able to confirm<br>
that migrations from older qemu versions no longer work.<br>
Yep 10.1 is released by now so it might end up as &quot;The problem is what=
<br>
happens when we detect after we have done a release that something has<br>
gone wrong&quot; from [2].<br>
But I still can&#39;t believe only we see this and therefore for now want<b=
r>
to believe I messed up on our side when merging 10.1 :-)<br>
<br>
For now this is a call if others have also seen any older release<br>
migrating to 10.1 to throw:<br>
=C2=A0 error: operation failed: guest CPU doesn&#39;t match specification:<=
br>
missing features: pdcm,arch-capabilities<br>
<br>
Hector will later today reply here with a summary of what we found so<br>
far, to provide you a more complete picture to think about, without<br>
having to read through all the messy interim steps in the Ubuntu bug.<br>
<br></blockquote><div><br></div><div><span style=3D"font-family:arial,sans-=

The domain definition used to reproduce this issue is quite simple:

This migration failure can be broken down to 2 separate issues, each one is=
 related to one missing feature: pdcm &amp; arch-capabilities.
Based on our best understanding of the moment, the behavior of QEMU on thes=
e 2 features has been changed recently in 10.1.

- arch-capabilities</font></pre><pre style=3D"color:rgb(0,0,0)"><font face=

- pdcm
  <a href=3D"https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/e68ec2980901c8e7f948f33057=
70962806c53f0b">https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/e68ec2980901c8e7f948f33=
05770962806c53f0b</a>
  (i386/cpu: Move adjustment of CPUID_EXT_PDCM before feature_dependencies[=
] check)

  this commit makes QEMU disable the pdcm if PMU is off, I think on previou=
s QEMU versions,
  this is also the expected behavior but there is a bug that is fixed in th=
e commit.
  When I enable the PMU in the guest definition:=20
    &lt;features&gt;
    &lt;pmu state=3D&#39;on&#39;/&gt;
    &lt;/features&gt;
  The missing pdcm feature error disappears.

If we revert both these two commits, the migration works.

We are looking into potential solutions to this migration issue and accordi=
ng to the documenation [1],
our failure might fall into the 4th case:
  $ qemu-7.2 -M pc-7.2 -&gt; qemu-8.0 -M pc-7.2

Presumably, it is necessary to add some compability properties to make the =
new behavior on pdcm and
arch-capabilities compatible with older QEMU versions, but as Christian sai=
d -
10.1 is already released so it might be more complex now

## Other failed combinations

We looked into all the failing migration combinations we might have in our =
supported releases.
We can confirm that the migration is also broken for other QEMU versions we=
 support in various Ubuntu releases:
(F =3D Focal, J =3D Jammy, N =3D Noble, P =3D Plucky, Q =3D Questing)

F-4.2 -&gt; Q-10.1                                                         =
                                                        =20
J-6.2 -&gt; Q-10.1                                                         =
                                                          =20
N-8.2 -&gt; Q-10.1                                                         =
                                                          =20
P-9.2 -&gt; Q-10.1                                                         =
                                                          =20

Maybe worth to note that these combinations are tested by our automated tes=
ts and they just leave
cpu unspecified allowing libvirt to pick safe defaults instead of using hos=
t-model as shown in the sample
domain definition above.=20
