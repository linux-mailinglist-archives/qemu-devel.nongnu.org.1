If there's no way to trigger a real functional bug anyway, it's also ok we
omit the Fixes.

What I was curious is whether this issue also exists for the main migration
channel when with tls, especially when e.g. multifd not enabled at all.  As
I don't see anywhere that qemu uses gnutls_bye() for any tls session.

I think it's a good to find that we overlooked this before.. and IMHO it's
always good we could fix this.

Does it mean we need proper gnutls_bye() somewhere?

If we need an explicit gnutls_bye(), then I wonder if that should be done
on the main channel as well.

If we don't need gnutls_bye(), then should we always ignore pre-mature
termination of tls no matter if it's multifd or non-multifd channel (or
even a tls session that is not migration-related)?

Thanks,
