* IIUC postcopy preempt channel is created towards the end of the
migration when the Postcopy phase starts. At that time, the 'main' and
'multifd' channels are already established and working. Having the
'main' and when multifd is enabled 'multifd' channels in place is a
requirement for starting new migration. So when both the 'main' and
'multifd' channels are established, the new incoming connection is
seen as the 'postcopy' one; And it falls to the 'else' block of the
'if' conditional ->  if (!migration_has_main_and_multifd_channels()) {

* When does postcopy preempt channel creation race with the multifd
channel creation?

* migration_needs_multiple_sockets() => return migrate_multifd() ||
migrate_postcopy_preempt();

* That logical OR should have been AND, no? It returns true even when
one of them is true. That's not multiple types (multifd/postcopy) of
sockets. I don't think it helps much.

* Let's try this:
    - First differentiation: peekable Vs non-peekable channels
    - Peekable channels
         - Main
         - Multifd
    - Non-peekable channels
         - Postcopy preempt
         - TLS
         - File/mapped_ram

    if (qio_channel_has_feature(ioc, QIO_CHANNEL_FEATURE_READ_MSG_PEEK))
    {
            if (channel_magic == cpu_to_be32(QEMU_VM_FILE_MAGIC)) {
                channel = CH_MAIN;
            } else if (channel_magic == cpu_to_be32(MULTIFD_MAGIC)) {
                channel = CH_MULTIFD;
    } else {
            if (!strcmp(ioc->name, "migration-tls-incoming")
                || !strcmp(ioc->name, "migration-file-incoming"))) {
               channel = CH_MULTIFD;
            } else {
               channel = CH_POSTCOPY;
            }
    }

* With above, the 'main' channel shall have to send 'magic value' even
for reconnection during the postcopy recovery phase. If all channels
were consistent and sent a magic value, this code would be much
simpler and we may not have to care/worry about the _order_ in which
these connections are made.

   if (channel == 'main')
       process_main_channel()
   else if (channel == 'multifd')
       process_multifd_channel()
   else if (channel == 'tls')
       process_tls_channel()
    else if (channel == 'file')
       process_file_channel()
    else if (channel == 'postcopy')
       process_postcopy_channel()

* TBH, I think we have complicated this whole thing with multiple
channel types, their inconsistent behaviour and dependence on the
_order_ in which connections are made. Do we really need channel
types? Could we consider rationalising them?

* The first paragraph says these channels are used without
migrate_multifd(); And the second paragraph says they are used with
migrate_multifd() only....??
===
} else {
        /* Multiple connections */
        assert(migration_needs_multiple_sockets());
        if (migrate_multifd()) {
            multifd_recv_new_channel(ioc, &local_err);
        } else {
            assert(migrate_postcopy_preempt());
            f = qemu_file_new_input(ioc);
            postcopy_preempt_new_channel(mis, f);
        }
===
* IIUC in the current code, when migrate_multifd() is true, these
channels get processed via - multifd_recv_new_channel(). And when
migrate_multifd() is false, it falls to postcopy_preempt_new_channel()
part. Not sure if/how that works really. It is possible that currently
these (tls/file) channels are used only with migrate_multifd() enabled
and so are processed with multifd_recv_new_channel() function. The
current patch handles them the same way.

* About checking channel names, in the non-peekable category above,
how do we differentiate between 'TLS', 'File' and 'Postcopy' channels?
Without magic values, we don't have much choice really.  And seeing
those names in the code also tells the reader that 'TLS' and 'File'
channels are processed as CH_MULTIFD via - multifd_recv_new_channel().

* Here final else means the main channel (mis->from_src_file) is not
established, so it defaults to CH_MAIN.

* Okay.

* My request is the same - let's think about having consistent channel
behaviour. The restructuring and overhauling of the channel processing
part could be done separately, outside the current scope of enabling
multifd+postcopy together with this series. Let's not try to fix
everything in one go, in one series.


Thank you.
