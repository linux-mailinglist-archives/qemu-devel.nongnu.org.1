This use-case sounds reasonable to me. I also imagine that
some machines can get fixed down the road perhaps to
the point where they enter the "virtualization use case".

However, since we are
getting this elaborate, would my old idea of a runtime flag
make sense now?

To recap, the idea was to add a "-virt" flag that will
block any machines, devices and so on not considered
part of the "virtualization use case".

We could also create a mechanism for downstreams to
tweak this as they see fit.
