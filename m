I have no idea :)

Evolving a target-dependent interface into a target-independent
interface without breaking compatibility is always a bother.

It's likely more of a bother when the interface is binary.  Textual
interfaces tend to have less target-dependence.

Designing a target-independent interface is probably easier than
evolving it compatibly from a target-dependent one.

QMP is textual, and it's designed for certain kinds of compatible
evolution.  Using QAPI/QMP for a debugging interface may be a perfectly
sensible idea.  I don't know enough about debugging interfaces to judge.

Use of QAPI/QMP does not imply use of the QMP monitor.  We can keep the
monitor and the debugging interface separate even though both are based
on QAPI/QMP.

The monitor code is gnarly, I'm afraid.  It supports multiple monitors,
but they are not fully independent for historical reasons, chiefly
implied mutual exclusion for commands.  Adding a QAPI/QMP-based
debugging interface without undue coupling to monitors may pose a few
technical problems.  One way to find out.
