I think patch 1 might be incomplete, as I'm not seeing what checks
for abstract or singleton classes in the 'qdev_new' code paths, used
by -device / device_add QMP. This is an example of the risks of adding
more failure scenarios to object_add.

Yes, having thought about this today, I came up with a way that we could
introduce a object_new_dynamic() variant with "Error *errp" instead of
asserts, and *crucially* force its use in the unsafe scenarios. ie any
place that is not passing a const,static string.  I've CC'd you on an
RFC series that mocks up this idea. That would be sufficient to remove
my objections wrt the singleton concept.


With regards,
Daniel
