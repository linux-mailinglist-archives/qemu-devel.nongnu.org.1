At least in the case of libvirt managed VMs, this series does
nothin by default, as they won't be using the 'stdio' chardev,
they'll require libvirt to first wire up the new QMP command,
and then apps using libvirt to call it. So in that sense, it'll
take a while before the effects are seen by users.

What about other non-Linux guest OS that may have correctly
implemented the virtio spec ?

At least FreeBSD appears to /not/ implemenmt resize at all:

  https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-src/blob/main/sys/dev/virtio/console/virtio_console.c#L884

Do we have a Windows impl of virtio-console with resize support ?

Any other places we should check ?

With regards,
Daniel
