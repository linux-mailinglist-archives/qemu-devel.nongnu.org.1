Yes, admin configuration mistakes with TLS certs are an incredibly
common problem, frustratingly hard to diagnose, especially when the
failure only happens at runtime, not startup. So this code is mostly
about "sanity checks" on configuration.

Yes, it is a slight degradation in the checks we are doing in
certain scenarios. As the world moves increasingly towards
eliptic curves and/or post-quantum crypto, the check is less
and less important. So its an acceptable tradeoff. I've got
another series coming soon that supports post-quantum crypto
better in QEMU
