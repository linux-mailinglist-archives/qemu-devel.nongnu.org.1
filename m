The commit message needs to call out the license choice of the
imported file.

This 4th clause is rather obnoxious and....

....this appears to not be compliant with the license since it fails
to include the dates

AFAICT this license is derived from a classic BSD 3 clause, with the
extra 4th clause added.

I don't see any SPDX license matching this, which is painful as it
means it is going to need license approval before it can be included
by distributions downstream.

Does this really have to be under a custom license instead of a
well known standard license ? There's really no good reason for
inventing new open source licenses.

With regards,
Daniel
