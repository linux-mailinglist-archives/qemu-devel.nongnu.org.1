One more thing: please check whether kvm.ko memory regions need to be
modified or split to match the SHMEM_MAP mapping's read/write
permissions.

The VIRTIO Shared Memory Area pages can have PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE,
PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, or PROT_NONE.

kvm.ko memory regions are read/write or read-only. I'm not sure what
happens when the guest accesses a kvm.ko memory region containing
mappings with permissions more restrictive than its kvm.ko memory
region. In other words, the kvm.ko memory region would allow the
access but the Linux virtual memory configuration would cause a page
fault.

For example, imagine a QEMU MemoryRegion containing a SHMEM_MAP
mapping with PROT_READ. The kvm.ko memory region would be read/write
(unless extra steps were taken to tell kvm.ko about the permissions).
When the guest stores to the PROT_READ page, kvm.ko will process a
fault...and I'm not sure what happens next.

A similar scenario occurs when a PROT_NONE mapping exists within a
kvm.ko memory region. I don't remember how kvm.ko behaves when the
guest tries to access the pages.

It's worth figuring this out before going further because it could
become tricky if issues are discovered later. I have CCed David
Hildenbrand in case he knows.
