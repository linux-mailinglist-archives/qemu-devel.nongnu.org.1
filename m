>=20Instruction instrumentation is done before executing the instruction =
itself, as you can see by running:
> ./build/qemu-x86_64 -plugin build/tests/tcg/plugins/libinsn.so -d in_as=
m,op /usr/bin/true
>=20
>=20I'm not entirely sure about the sequence when there is an exception w=
hile fetching the instruction though. You can give it a try, track the PC=
 using insn instrumentation, and we can identify which cases are not work=
ing.
>=20
>=20The test plugin itself is not complicated.

What I'm saying ist that this exactly is not feasible for quite a few
relevant instructions. As someone who isn't all too intimate with TCG
itself, it's not even clear if we can rely on jump and branch
instructions only occuring at the end of a tb. At least a superficial
glance at the documentation tells me we can, but if this should in fact
not be the case, or if someone introduces something like zero overhead
loops inside a tb, all bets are off.

 matching, and register the next expected with to_pc.
>=20
>=20We can then add tests targeting supported architectures using the plu=
gin, and ensuring it never fails.
> It's hard to know we don't miss events though. Except if we write manua=
l assembly system mode tests, that trigger the expected behaviour. But it=
 would be tedious, and I'm really not sure there is a real value with red=
uced examples like this.

So currently my thinking goes in the direction of having the plugin
print a warning every time we don't have an expected from_pc to check
against. Probably also have this be a feature you can deactivate.
