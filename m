I confess that's not a good example, but my point was that it was
straightforward idea to have two layers of settings, meanwhile it provides
full flexiblity.

Postponing the per-device flag might still break different backends if you
specify the list with virtio-net-pci.

But only until now, I noticed you were using "virtio-net-tap" instead of
"virtio-net-pci".

Ouch.. I think that's even more complicated. :(

Here I think the problem is, introducing some arbitrary strings into
migration QAPI to represent some combinations of "virtio frontend F1" and
"virtio backend B1" doesn't sound the right thing to do.  Migration ideally
should have zero knowledge of the device topology, types of devices,
frontends or backends.  "virtio-*" as a string should not appear in
migration/ or qapi/migration.json at all..

Why a bool isn't enough?  Could you share a link to that discussion?

So this is likely why you changed your mind.  I think machine properties
definitely make sense.

We set it OFF on old machines because when on old machines the src QEMU
_may_ not support this feature.  We set it ON on new machines because when
the QEMU has the new machine declared anyway, it is guaranteed to support
the feature.

We can still manually set the per-device properties iff the admin is sure
that both sides of "old" QEMUs support this feature.  However machine
properties worked like that for many years and I believe that's how it
works, by being always on the safe side.

If we follow the machine property way of doing this (which I believe we
used for years), then mgmt doesn't need any change except properly enable
fd-passing in migration cap/params when it's a local migration.  That's
all.  It doesn't need to know anything about "which device(s) supports
fd-passing", because they'll all be auto-set by the machine types.

I feel like you wanted to enable this feature _while_ using an old machine
type.  Is that what you're looking for?  Can you simply urge the users to
move to new machine types when looking for new features?  I believe that's
what we do..

MT properties were working like that for a long time.  What you were asking
is fair, but if so I'd still like to double check with you on that's your
real purpose (enabling this feature on NEW qemus but OLD machine types, all
automatically).

Thanks,
