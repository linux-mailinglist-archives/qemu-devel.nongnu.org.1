Yes, we might still need a slow copy fallback for those filesystems,
i.e. essentially a 'cp --reflink=auto'. For myself, coredumps will
generally live on XFS, so I would benefit from creating that copy in the
same filesystem where the coredump lives, and for you it shouldn't hurt
at least.

Another thought... it's a bit crazy, but... we're QEMU, we have our own
tools for this. We could create a qcow2 overlay for the coredump and
export it using FUSE! :-D (Probably not very practical because you need
the right paths for the binaries, but I had to mention it.)
