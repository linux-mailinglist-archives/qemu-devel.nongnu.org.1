Meson provides a nice "suite" concept to facilitate selection of a
subset of tests.

eg, to limit to running just 'rust' unit tests, I might expect we
should have

  meson test --suite rustunit

and have this invoked by 'make check-rustunit' 

Similar can be done for clippy, or other types of rust tests

Daniel
