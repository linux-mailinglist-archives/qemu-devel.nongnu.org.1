Might want to say also
 Guest EL3 firmware does not pass this devicetree on to later
 components of the software stack.

I would drop the last sentence here, and use "may" instead of "will".

Otherwise looks good to me, and the updates to the spec URLs
are particularly helpful. As a docs change I'd be happy
to take it into 9.0 (at least before rc2) if some other
sbsa-ref-knowledgeable person wants to either review or ack it.
(But it's also OK if it misses 9.0 and goes into 9.1.)
