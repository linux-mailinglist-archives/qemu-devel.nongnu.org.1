Hi Igor,

Thanks for taking time to review and sorry for not being prompt. I was in
transit
due to some difficult personal situation.

There is a difference though. vCPU presence cannot be changed after the
system has
initialized in the ARM world due to the Architectural constraint. I think
in the x86 world
it is allowed?

Not sure what you mean here but this is what is being done.

I've to disagree here. Standy-by means you will have to keep all the vCPUs
states
realized and the objects will always exist. This is a problem for larger
systems
with vCPU hotplug support as it drastically affects the boot times. Please
check
the KVM Forum 2023 slides for objective values.

It's been a long time since this series was actually conceived and at that
time we wanted
to use it for kata containers but later with the gradual adoption of
various microvms
and the cloud hypervisor requirements have bit changed. Boot time still
remains one
of the major requirements. Not bounding boot time while using this feature
will
seriously affect performance if the number of vCPUs increases

Not faking care of it will mean realization  of the unnecessary vCPU
threads during
the VM init time, which in turn will increase the boot time. Trade-off
between more
clean design and performance.

One of the main goals is to facilitate seamless migration from the x86
world to
ARM world. Hence, preservation of the x86 interface is important. It is a
requirement.
Just imagine if Apple had to change end user interface experience after
migrating iOS
from x86 to ARM architecture. ?

Tricks are just for ACPI and GIC and nothing else. Rest is a
boilerplate code of the
vCPU hotplug framework which x86 is also using.

I'm still not convinced of the stand-by approach because of the performance
impact
it will have upon increasing the number of possible vCPUs and its worst
case is
unbounded. That's a major problem.

We can do that.

We need more discussion on this as our requirements for which we floated
this
feature are not being met using stand-by cases.

Thanks!

&gt; To address this issue, introduce an `is_enabled` state in the `AcpiCpu=

 QEMU,<br>

good so far<br>

I agree with Gavin, it&#39;s not CPU property/business, but a platform one.=
<br>
<br>
Pass it as argument to cpu_hotplug_hw_init(),<br>
and maybe rename to always_present.<br>
Then make sure that it&#39;s configurable in GED (which calls the function)=

and just turn it on for arm/virt machine.<br>
