If we still want to allow for this rather than enforcing in-place
update, one alternative would be to just allow a separate lock file
to be specified rather than locking the certificate file itself. That
would provide a bit more flexibility.

I can update the QEMU implementation to take -certs-lock-file in
addition to -certs-file so they can be specified separately. And if
-certs-lock-file is not specified then QEMU will just assume
management handles things different or has agreed to not do endorsement
key updates while SNP guests are running.

I think we'd considered something like that originally but the thinking
was that locking the certs themselves was more organic in terms of an
"obvious"/natural solution. But it does end up being a bit more
inflexible WRT how libraries/etc. might manage file updates underneath
the covers, so maybe a lock file is the better approach after all.
