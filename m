We've had this conversation before too:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/f928986fd4095b1f27c83ede96f3b0dd65ad965e.camel@linux.ibm.com/T/#u

But the synopsis is nothing does.  The design is to be entirely
independent of vTPM implementation: it will actually work with any TPM
obeying the simulator IP protocol (MS reference, ibmswtpm2 or even your
swtpm) but the price of this is that the user has to preserve the vTPM
state, by whatever means they deem appropriate, independently of the VM
snapshot image.
