Those are trivial to review, just "git diff HEAD^^". No need to
separate them into a new submission.

That's what I did: I put them at the beginning of the series of
pending patches, so they _are_ indeed merged after the CI patches. The
only issue here is that patch 4 ("rust: add support for migration in
device models") was dependent on the Device proc macro, but that was
easy enough to extract.

Yep.

I understand. My point is that the callbacks you move
(pl011_can_receive, pl011_receive, pl011_event) in the end will belong
into the C<->Rust chardev bindings. A patch to remove "pub" would have
basically the same benefit without the churn in indentation.

I will but for now I'll say that the commit messages do not address
the questions I'm asking above.

More in general, we need to establish conventions on what the Rust
APIs look like (about qemu_* prefixes, for example). Personally I
prefer to have APIs that, while easy enough to connect to the C ones,
are idiomatic. But you can post these two patches separately and we
can discuss it there.

What I'm saying is that these are discussions where we need to reach
an agreement on, and document the choices.
