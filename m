I'm wondering if there are real user cases that sets a lower PMU version
than host PMU version (live migration on different HW platforms?). In
theory, the higher PMU version should fully back compatible with lower PMU
version, but it's not always true in reality. One example is that the
Anythread bit introduced in v3 is dropped in PMU v5 on Intel processors.
This causes some difficulties to support PMU version 3/4 on host with PMU
version 5+. Different PMU versions between host and guest could cause
similar issues on other platforms.

Currently KVM supported highest PMU version is v2. We plan to support
higher PMU version for Intel processors on top of mediated vPMU. If guest
sets pmu version to 3/4 on host with PMU version 5+, the Anythread bit
would be marked as reserved,
