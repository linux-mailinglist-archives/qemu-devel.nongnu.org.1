Fair!

Pierrick's stated goal is "no noticable differences".  We've explored
what this means.  We can also explore changes that would help us reach
the goal more easily, and maybe even consider setting a less ambitious
goal.

With one exception noted by Pierrick.

Schema introspection is more robust, and often simpler, especially for
more complicated questions.

Fair.  Management applications are quite unlikely to ask "does this
target support SEV?"  If they know anything about SEV, they know it's
x86.  They may still want to ask "does this QEMU provide SEV stuff?"
This remains possible even with the conditionals deleted.

Nice to have: "inherently specific to <target>" is blatantly obvious.
Target conditionals do that only approximately: they don't tell whether
the condition is inherent or just a "currently".  If we drop the
conditions, we should consider other means, such as clearer doc
comments, or reorganizing the section structure.

While we QEMU developers gratefully appreciate an "I don't know whether
our management application does <unadvisable-thing>, but if you break
it, we'll fix our management application" attitude, we nevertheless try
quite hard not to break management applications :)

query-cpu-definitions can't currently, fail, but the other query-cpu-FOO
all have multiple failure modes, which can complicate things if you need
to distinguish "failed because non-applicable / not implemented" from
other failures.  Avoiding such complications is largely why
introspection exists.

The ideal solution is to implement the query-cpu-FOO for all targets.
