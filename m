Configuration previously known as parameters less the TLS stuff.

Yes, this is the state since PATCH 05.

This is new in this patch.

Your description doesn't cover optionalness.  Here's my understanding:

* MigrationSetParameters has optional members, because
  migrate-set-parameters needs that.

* MigrationParameters would ideally have these members non-optional,
  because query-migrate-parameters wants that.

* But to enable sharing via common base type MigrationConfigBase, we
  accept unwanted optional in MigrationParameters and thus
  query-migrate-parameters.

* This doesn't apply to the non-shared members of MigrationParameters,
  so you made them non-optional.  These are @tls-creds, @tls-hostname,
  @tls-authz.

* But in MigrationConfig they're optional again, because "empty string
  means absent" is silly; we want "NULL means absent".

Correct?

Up to here, this enables cleanup of some "empty string means absent"
silliness in later patches.

The remainder is about unifying capabilities into parameters.  I'd split
the patch (but I'm a compulsive patch splitter).

Perhaps this would be slightly easier to digest for the reader if you
talked just about capabilities at first.  Once that's understood,
mention we have the same choice for new configuration bits.

I think the argument is that migration capabilities are a pointless
interface complication.  One mechanism (parameters) is better than two
(parameters and capabilities).

This is part 2 "unify capabilities into parameters".

Missing in your series: deprecate migrate-set-capabilities and
