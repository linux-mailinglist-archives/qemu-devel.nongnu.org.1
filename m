I went ahead and just fixed the code, by sticking more to the original
code, and use a #if between the hostxfwd and hostfwd APIs. I sent the
corresponding pull request for inclusion.

Nicholas, you'll be able to rebase your unix work on top of it. Be sure
however to update the documentation of the options, we won't commit it
unless it is documented (hint: anything that is not documented does
*not* exist for users)

There's also the IPv6 support which some people were having a look at,
and which'd need to be revived...
