From: Daniel P. Berrangé <berrange@redhat.com>

This removes the TARGET_* conditions from all the CPU commands
that are conceptually target independent. Top level stubs are
provided to cope with targets which do not currently implement
all of the commands. Adjust the doc comments accordingly.

-# @CpuModelInfo:
-#
-# Virtual CPU model.
-#
-# A CPU model consists of the name of a CPU definition, to which delta
-# changes are applied (e.g. features added/removed).  Most magic
-# values that an architecture might require should be hidden behind
-# the name.  However, if required, architectures can expose relevant
-# properties.
-#
-# @name: the name of the CPU definition the model is based on
-#
-# @props: a dictionary of QOM properties to be applied
-#

-# @CpuModelExpansionType:
-#
-# An enumeration of CPU model expansion types.
-#
-# @static: Expand to a static CPU model, a combination of a static
-#     base model name and property delta changes.  As the static base
-#     model will never change, the expanded CPU model will be the
-#     same, independent of QEMU version, machine type, machine
-#     options, and accelerator options.  Therefore, the resulting
-#     model can be used by tooling without having to specify a
-#     compatibility machine - e.g. when displaying the "host" model.
-#     The @static CPU models are migration-safe.
-#
-# @full: Expand all properties.  The produced model is not guaranteed
-#     to be migration-safe, but allows tooling to get an insight and
-#     work with model details.
-#
-# .. note:: When a non-migration-safe CPU model is expanded in static
-#    mode, some features enabled by the CPU model may be omitted,
-#    because they can't be implemented by a static CPU model
-#    definition (e.g. cache info passthrough and PMU passthrough in
-#    x86).  If you need an accurate representation of the features
-#    enabled by a non-migration-safe CPU model, use @full.  If you
-#    need a static representation that will keep ABI compatibility
-#    even when changing QEMU version or machine-type, use @static (but
-#    keep in mind that some features may be omitted).
