Peter has proposed an alternate scheme. Take a look at his series. But
it basically keeps the compression as is and moves some code into the
prepare() phase:

Take a look whether incorporating zero_page_detect() in the prepare()
phase would work. We're trying to walk toward a multifd_ops model that
is not tied to the pages concept.
