Yes. We should definitely collaborate and send a single series to support b=
oth
virt and sifive machines. You had a question about widening the
hpmevent in your series.

(Answering here to keep the discussion in 1 place)

As per the section 18.1. Count Overflow Control, only top 8 bits are reserv=
ed.
Thus, a platform can implement their event encoding to upto 56 bit wide.
