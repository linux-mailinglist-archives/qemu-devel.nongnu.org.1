Yes, we don't need to set CPUID_EXT_MONITOR in host_cpu_enable_cpu_pm().

I'll drop this patch though I still think it makes sense to reorder
cpu_exec_realizefn () call.

As explained in another comment, I agree that these two bits need to be
checked against MWAIT availability, or even we don't need
cpu->mwait->ecx at all. But I don't understand why the code explicitly
states that "We always wake on interrupt even if host does not have the
capability", and don't know if it could cause problems if they are removed.
