To solve the problem of needing reintroducing ',' in type names and adding 
a new subclass for every compatible device variant (which might also be 
wasteful if this creates a new type struct for these) maybe you'd have to 
attach a string array to classes or type info instead with all the 
compatible names and then look for the type to instantiate based on that. 
I don't know what the best way would be for that, adding a class property 
or adding this array to type? And maybe you need a new funcion to find the 
type instead of qdev_try_new().

I don't know how this works but the types seem to be stored in a hash 
table so instead of an array of compatible names maybe all that's needed 
is to allow adding alternative names for the same type in this type hash 
table or add another hash table for those alternative names then types 
could be looked up the same way from that by the compatible names without 
needing to subclass them multiple times. If these are separated hash 
tables then ',' may be allowed in the compatible names table or if it's 
the same types table then maybe the names can be encoded in some way to 
separate them from normal type names and avoid the need to reintroduce 
','. These are just vague ideas but maybe gives you some inspiration for 
which way to go to get closer to be able to upstream it.
