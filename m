Sorry to bother you again. I still have a few questions.
1. What does "bare metal images" mean? Are they used in tcg mode?

2. How QEMU assumes an ELF file is a bare metal image? Can you post
the corresponding code?

3. How can I make the hw/arm/boot.c code assumes the ELF files are
Linux kernels?

Looking forward to your reply.

Thanks,
Kunkun Jiang
