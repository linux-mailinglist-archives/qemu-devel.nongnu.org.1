It also isn't future proof. People will change their program behaviour
based on the limitations of the particular QEMU version they tested
against. QEMU later changes/fixes its impl, and apps are not eithuer
applying a redundant workaround, or worse, applying a workaround that
is now actively harmful.

Whereever practical, it is preferrable to check a discrete feature
or behaviour in a functional way, rather than matching on "is it QEMU"

With regards,
Daniel
