Yay! Thanks a lot for doing this. I lost my appetite for arguing for Python
version bumps, but when other people do it, I am always cheering :) Sorry
to have been MIA while you were submitting this.

I'll handle it - the CI over there was hosed as well and needed some other
adjustments that aren't applicable to mainline CI, I got it green again
just this morning.

Technically, the standalone QMP package still supports 3.7, because I have
a bit tighter control over the dependencies and environments there, which
has allowed me to support older versions for longer. It's probably due for
a bump now that 3.9 is our minimum, though.

Related: Akihiko is trying to bump the Sphinx version, I want to integrate
linting for the QAPI subpackage, Peter Maydell is encountering Sphinx build
errors dependent on the version installed, and Daniel wants to integrate
python linting into make check - I have to line everything up and make sure
it all works at the same time. Hopefully good progress on that by week's
end now that I've knocked out the standalone CI issues.
