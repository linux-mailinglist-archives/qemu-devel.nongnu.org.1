I understand your POV, but I think that would be a mistake,
and would undermine the usefulness of the feature.

The deployment model has a cluster of hosts and guests, all
belonging to the same user. The user goal is to measure host
power consumption imposed by the guest, and dynamically adjust
guest workloads in order to minimize power consumption of the
host.

The guest workloads can impose non-negligble power consumption
loads on non-vCPU threads in QEMU. Without that accounted for,
any adjustments will be working from (sometimes very) inaccurate
data.

IOW, I think it is right to include non-vCPU threads usage in
the reported info, as it is still fundamentally part of the
load that the guest imposes on host pCPUs it is permitted to
run on.

With regards,
Daniel
