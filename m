As a side note, we recently did some work around performance analysis 
(for aarch64), as you can see here [1]. In the end, QEMU performance 
depends (roughly in this order) on:
1. quality of code generated by TCG
2. helper code to implement instructions
3. mmu emulation

Other state of the art translators that exist are faster (fex, box64) 
mainly by enhancing 1, and relying on various tricks to avoid 
translating some libraries calls. But those translators are host/target 
specific, and the ratio of instructions generated (vs target ones read) 
is much lower than QEMU. In the experimentation listed in the blog, I 
observed that for qemu-system-aarch64, we have an average expansion 
factor of around 18 (1 guest insn translates to 18 host ones).

For users seeing performance decreases, beyond the QEMU code changes, 
adding new target instructions may add new helpers, which may be called 
by the stack people use, and they can sometimes observe a slower behaviour.

There are probably some other low hanging fruits for other target 
architectures.
