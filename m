Thanks for posting this series, it's definitely an important piece

Would that be possible to share your changes, and build instructions for 
this? While working on SMMU emulation, we finally left this on the side 
due to lack of a software stack being able to use secure SMMU, as we 
were not aware that Hafnium + op-tee could make use of it.

I am not sure about the current policy in QEMU for test oriented 
devices, but it would be really useful to have something similar 
upstream (Note: it's out of the scope of this series).
One challenge working with SMMU emulation is that reproducing setups and 
triggering specific code paths is hard to achieve, due to the indirect 
use of SMMU feature (through DMA) and the complex software stack usually 
involved.
Having something upstream available to work on SMMU emulation, at least 
on device side, would be a great addition.

Eric, Peter, is this something that would be acceptable to merge?

I was not aware of it, thanks for sharing this excellent paper.
