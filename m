We can, and I'll do.

Mentioning SETUP in this if clause might be slightly confusing?  How about
I only keep the latter sentence (and change it a bit; there's one extra
"migration")?

  /*

I'll split that, but just to mention, I think there should have no
functional change, or we're doomed.

The old code worked the same by ignoring migrate_set_state() when PAUSED in
the cmpxchg(), which is implicit and unclear.

Right, it won't hurt having that here, but let me drop it.

IIUC it's just that many functions around this area used to be called
migrate_fd_*().  Let me know if you have some suggestions, though.

Yes, that's by design.

It'll be the same AFAICT, the 1st check should mostly be meaningless as the
sem must be posted at least once.  Yes I should have had a comment
somewhere but I didn't.. if you want me to keep the old way it's also fine,
isn't a big deal here to check first either, just save some cycles when I
worked on these lines.

I think here it must be RECOVER_SETUP after this patch.  I changed it to
use the helper as I think that's cleaner (precopy doesn't allow resume),
and we don't need such change if the state machine trivially changes again.
