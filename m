Right.  And if to be precise - the time doesn't matter, but "how many dirty
page left".  For extremely busy guests, longer precopy doesn't help, for
example.. so time isn't very relevant, IMHO.  It's just that postcopy
always have an upper time limit, which is guest mem size / bw.

The question is more about whether yank should be used at all for
migration only, not about the rest instances.

My answer is yank should never be used for migration, because
"migrate_cancel" also unplugs the power plug.. It's not anything more
enforced.  It's only doing less always.

E.g. migration_yank_iochannel() is exactly what we do with
qmp_migrate_cancel() in the first place, only that migrate_cancel only does
it on the main channel (on both qemufiles even if ioc is one), however it
should be suffice, and behave the same way, as strong as "yank".

Meanwhile, "yank" definitely lacks the graceful side of thing, not only on
"cancelled", but also anything extra in migration_cancel() that wasn't
about shutdown().  Examples, qmp_migrate_cancel has special care on:

  - migrate_dirty_limit(), where it'll shutdown the limit threads too
    alongside if migration cancels,

  - process the possible hang case with PRE_SWITCHOVER.

  - if the cancel happened right during switchover, and if at that time the
    disks are inactivated, it'll re-activate the disks

In general, there's no reason to use yank on migration, IMHO, because it's
not stronger either on shutting the NIC.

Considering it's confusing to mostly everyone, and tons of people asked me
about this.. maybe I should send a patch to remove yank from migration?

Thanks,
