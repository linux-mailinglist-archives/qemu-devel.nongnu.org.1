If an OS stops supporting a platform in new versions then due to the 
policy of supporting only the last two OS versions in QEMU may lead to 
breaking this. Maybe it tries to say that Tier 3 is intended to be fixed 
but no guarantees on when? It is also clarified below so maybe this clause 
is not needed or need to be reworded?
