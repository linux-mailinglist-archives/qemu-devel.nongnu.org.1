It won't cause a crash even if the MR struct is not embedded as long as 
the data structure is freed in the instance_finalize callback. I suggest 
the following:

"This doesn't cause any bad effects in the common case where the
data structure is managed by the owner because the memory allocated for
the MemoryRegion itself is valid until the owner is also finalized.
However, it is still semantically wrong to touch the MemoryRegion after
its finalization and confusing."

Your other suggestions look good so I'll apply them with v2.

You are right. I'll remove the statement.

I'll wrap them by 72 columns.

I'll add a patch to remove object_unparent() calls from hw/vfio/pci.c 
with v2.
