In this case, assume the overlap can be detected via certain structs, 
for e.g. a HVA->IOVA reverse tree, then a full and slow lookup needs to 
be performed. Here we can try to match using the size, but I feel its 
best to identify the exact IOVA range by the GPA. This can be done 
through a tree storing the GPA->HVA mappings, and the reverse lookup 
from HVA->GPA will help identify if the HVA falls into certain GPA range.

Is there any reason why the first search can't pass in the GPA to 
further help identify? Suppose it's verified that the specific GPA range 
does exists via the HVA->GPA lookup.

Does C map to a different GPA range than where region A and B reside 
originally? The flatten guest view should guarantee that, right? Then it 
shouldn't be a problem by passing in the GPA as the secondary ID for the 
reverse HVA->IOVA lookup.
