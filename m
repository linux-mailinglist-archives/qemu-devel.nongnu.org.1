I had that impression possibly because our QE team tests VFIO normally with
vGPU, and my memory is 1Q ~= 1GB device data, where NQ ~= N GB (mostly vRAM
per my understanding).

The thing is if VFIO always relies on 1 fd read() then it's impossible to
scale.  Maybe there's chance in the future to provide other interfaces so
that at least data can be concurrently read or updated, even if they can
not directly be offseted.

Most of the vCPUs took only a portion of milliseconds, but some may took a
long time like 100+ ms.  We still haven't looked into why some vCPU is
special and what caused that slowness when save(), however consider >1
vCPUs taking 100ms they'll be added up lump sum contributing to the total
downtime.  That's definitely unwanted.

If we can somehow concurrently submit device states save() jobs to multiple
threads, then it could be potentially useful.

Yes.  Note that I haven't looked closely in your patchsets right now, as I
mentioned it may not apply due to the recent fixes.  However please feel
free to repost whatever that you think would still be worthwhile.

We can keep discussing that.  So far I still think it'll be more valuable
if you can propose something that will apply not only to VFIO but also
other devices on concurrent save/loads, but I don't think I have everything
thought thoroughly.  So feel free to go with what you think proper, and we
can keep the discussion in your new thread if you're going to prepare
something.

Thanks,
