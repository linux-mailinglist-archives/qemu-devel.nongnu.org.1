I thought I'd checked it, but now that I have reviewed the functions you
looked at, I no longer think it's safe to move drain_call_rcu() into
qdev_device_add_from_qdict(). drain_call_rcu() drops the BQL and must
not be called from non-reentrant multi-threaded code paths.

For example, if drain_call_rcu() is called from device emulation code
then another vCPU thread could execute that same device's emulation code
while the BQL is dropped. That's usually unsafe because most device
emulation code only expects to run in one thread at any given time
thanks to the BQL.

Here are the cases:
- qemu_create_cli_devices: safe because this happens before device
  emulation runs in vCPU threads
- Xen: safe because there are no vCPU threads when QEMU just provides
  device emulation in a normal Xen system. But I'm not sure if usbback
  can also be used in a QEMU's Xen HVM guest mode where KVM handles
  vCPUs, it might be a problem there.
- virtio_net_set_features() -> failover_add_primary() is unsafe. Another
  vCPU thread could enter virtio-net emulation code while the thread
  running virtio_net_set_features() drops the lock.

I think it's better to duplicate drain_call_rcu() into hmp_device_add()
than to risk breaking the other code paths.
