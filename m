For the whole series as is

 Tested-by: Daniel P. Berrang√© <berrange@redhat.com>

as it does what you claim it does here when I tried it.

As an example, one dir name appears to be:

  __main__.MemAddrCheck.test_phybits_ok_pentium_pae

I'd rather prefer it if the dir name matched the test script
file name - in this case test_mem_addr_space.py, as I don't
want to have to lookup which class names were defined inside
each test script. We could drop the "test_" prefix from the
method name too

IOW, could we make this dir name be:

  test_mem_addr_space.phybits_ok_pentium_pae


With regards,
Daniel
