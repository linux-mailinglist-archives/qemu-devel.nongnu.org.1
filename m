Yes, but this .rst file is built in-memory and never makes it to disk, like
Sphinx's autodoc for Python.

(We can add a debug knob to log it or save it out to disk if needed.)

Right, it's not fully finished, although I have events, commands, and

Right. My proposal is to recursively inline referenced bases for the
top-level members so that this manual is useful as a user reference,
without worrying about the actual QAPI structure.

Return types will just be hotlinked.

I haven't tried yet, but I believe it should be possible to "tag" each
referenced QAPI object and mark it as "visited". Each namespaced definition
would be tagged separately.

(i.e. qemu.block-core.blockdev-backup and qsd.block-core.blockdev-backup
would be two distinct entities.)

Then, the renderer could ignore/squelch untagged entities. (I think.)

Maybe some work to do to un-index unvisited entities.

Or we can go the other route and bake this info into the schema and squelch
stuff earlier. We can add this feature later. I am still not sure why your
prototype for this ran into cache issues, but I am convinced it should be
fixable by making namespaced entities distinct.

We could perhaps bake the namespace into the qapidoc directive, e.g.:

 .. qapi:autodoc:: schema.json
   :namespace: QSD

(And the default adds no namespace.)

To be honest, I figured I'd plow ahead and then find the counter-examples
programmatically and decide what to do once I had my pile of edge cases.

It might involve rewriting docs in some places, but I think the usability
win is completely worth the hassle.

It's possible there might be some rework needed to maximize cogency of the
generated docs, but I think prioritizing a user-facing reference for QMP is
the objectively correct end goal and I'm more than happy to work backwards
from that desired state.

Fingers crossed. This has bothered me about QEMU for years.

<br>
&gt; A goal for this syntax (and the generator) is to fully in-line all<br>
&gt; command/event/object members, inherited or local, boxed or not, branch=
ed<br>
&gt; or not. This should provide a boon to using these docs as a reference,=
<br>
&gt; because users will not have to grep around the page looking for variou=
s<br>
&gt; types, branches, or inherited members. Any arguments types will be<br>
&gt; hyperlinked to their definition, further aiding usability. Commands ca=
n<br>
&gt; be hotlinked from anywhere else in the manual, and will provide a<br>
&gt; complete reference directly on the first screenful of information.<br>
<br>
Let me elaborate a bit here.<br>
<br>
A command&#39;s arguments can be specified inline, like so:<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 { &#39;command&#39;: &#39;job-cancel&#39;, &#39;data&#39;: { =
&#39;id&#39;: &#39;str&#39; } }<br>
<br>
The arguments are then documented right with the command.<br>
<br>
But they can also be specified by referencing an object type, like so:<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 { &#39;command&#39;: &#39;block-dirty-bitmap-remove&#39;,<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 &#39;data&#39;: &#39;BlockDirtyBitmap&#39; }<br>
<br>
Reasons for doing it this way:<br>
<br>
=E2=80=A2 Several commands take the same arguments, and you don&#39;t want =
to repeat<br>
=C2=A0 yourself.<br>
<br>
=E2=80=A2 You want generated C take a single struct argument (&#39;boxed&#3=
9;: true).<br>
<br>
=E2=80=A2 The arguments are a union (which requires &#39;boxed&#39;: true).=
<br>
<br>
Drawback: the arguments are then documented elsewhere.=C2=A0 Not nice.<br>
<br>
Bug: the generated documentation fails to point there.<br>
<br>
You&#39;re proposing to inline the argument documentation, so it appears<br=
>
right with the command.<br>
<br>
An event&#39;s data is just like a command&#39;s argument.<br>
<br>
A command&#39;s return value can only specified by referencing a type.=C2=
=A0 Same<br>
doc usability issue.<br>
<br>
Similarly, a union type&#39;s base can specified inline or by referencing a=
<br>
struct type, and a union&#39;s branches must be specified by referencing a<=
br>
struct type.=C2=A0 Same doc usability issue.<br>
<br>
At least, the generated documentation does point to the referenced<br>
types.<br></blockquote></div></div><div dir=3D"auto"><br></div><div dir=3D"=

&gt; Known issues / points of interest:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; - The formatting upsets checkpatch. The default line length for the<br=
>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0&quot;black&quot; formatting tool is a little long. I&#39;=
ll fix it next spin.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; - I did my best to preserve cross-version compatibility, but some<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0problems have crept in here and there. This series may req=
uire<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0Sphinx&gt;=3D 4.0, like the dbus extension. Notably, the U=
buntu build fails<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0on Gitlab CI currently. The next version will text against=
 more Sphinx<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0versions more rigorously. Sphinx version 5.3.0 and above s=
hould work<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0perfectly.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; - There&#39;s a bug in Sphinx itself that may manifest in your testing=
,<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0concerning reported error locations. There&#39;s a patch i=
n this series<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0that fixes it, but it&#39;s later in the series. If you ru=
n into the bug<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0while testing with this series, try applying that patch fi=
rst.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; - QAPI &#39;namespaces&#39; aren&#39;t yet handled. i.e., there&#39;s =
nothing to<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0distinguish entities between QMP, QGA and QSD yet. That fe=
ature will<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0be added to a future version of this patchset (Likely when=
 the<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0generator is ready for inclusion: without it, references w=
ill clash<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0and the index will gripe about duplicated entries.)<br>
<br>
qemu-storage-daemon&#39;s QMP is a proper subset of qemu-system-FOO&#39;s.<=
br>
Regardless, each of them has its own, independent reference manual.<br>
That&#39;s defensible.<br>
<br>
But the way we build them can complicate matters.=C2=A0 For instance, when =
I<br>
tried to elide types not used for QMP from the reference manuals, I got<br>
defeated by Sphinx caching.<br></blockquote></div></div><div dir=3D"auto"><=
