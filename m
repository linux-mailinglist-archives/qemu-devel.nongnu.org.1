Currently, I'm working with EDK2 and QEMU so I have a branch [1] with
ongoing
modifications in files backends/spdm.c and hw/nvme/auth.c. Although the
current
modifications are able to exchange SPDM messages, it's far from being
complete
and it's not following better code practices yet. I'm making use of
Alistair's and
Mallawa's previous work in NVMe to authenticate it through PCI [2].

I'm not sure if I understood the redundancy. Would it be against QEMU
practices
to have another openssl as well as mbedtls linked inside it?

Also, I didn't know the LibSPDM insertion was already discussed previously
as
Alistair pointed out. I think I should have sent this patch as RFC instead.
As this is
my first interaction in any mail list, I'm sorry for any mistakes I made.

&gt; This one has been merged upstream and mainline QEMU supports it now:<b=
r>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <a href=3D"https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/specs/spdm.html" rel=3D"no=

<br>
So with that merged, is this proposal for linking to libspdm redundant ?<br=

<br>
With regards,<br>

<br></blockquote><div><br></div><div>I&#39;m not sure if I understood the r=
edundancy. Would it be against QEMU practices</div><div>to have another ope=
nssl as well as mbedtls linked inside it?</div><div><br></div><div>Also, I =
didn&#39;t know the LibSPDM insertion was already discussed previously as</=
div><div>Alistair pointed out. I think I should have sent this patch as RFC=
 instead. As this is=C2=A0</div><div>my first interaction in any mail list,=
 I&#39;m sorry for any mistakes I made.</div></div></div>
