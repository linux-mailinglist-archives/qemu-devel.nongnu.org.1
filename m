That's too narrow a definition.  Snapshot is working if you can capture
and restore the machine state.  A qemu snapshot can helpfully capture
some device states, but not all of it (Devices that are passed through,
like accelerators and AI units, are particularly problematic).  How you
get the external device state (IBM cloud has an elaborate scripted
state capture for GPUs, for instance) is up to the person implementing
the snapshot.  For this case, the added doc specifically warns "... the
state of the Microsoft Simulator server must be preserved (or the
server kept running) outside of QEMU for restore to be successful", so
I don't think there's going to be an expectation mismatch.
