Thanks for the ideas Nick. I guess the first one makes sense if we want 
to not need the unused functions.

Only thing I want to check there is, since the 
"ibm,configure-kernel-dump" rtas call is registered, kernel will think 
fadump is supported, and might try registering fadump (if "fadump=on" 
passed in kernel), will see what the kernel does on a failure to 
register fadump in earlyboot.

It generally falls back to kdump, will check.
