Hi Greg,

I'd appreciate comments from your side as well, as you are much on longer on
the QEMU 9p front than me.

I know you won't have the time to read up on the entire thread so I try to
summarize: basically this is yet another user-after-unlink issue, this time=
 on
directories instead of files.

Correct, that's based on what the 9p protocols define: a FID does not exact=
ly
translate to what a file handle is on a local system. Even after acquiring a
new FID by sending a Twalk request, subsequently client would still need to
send a Topen for server to actually open that file/directory.

And yes, QEMU's 9p server "fixes" the path string of a FID if it was moved
upon client request. If the move happened on host side, outside of server's
knowledge, then this won't happen ATM and hence it would break your use
case.

I don't think the problem here is the string based walk per se, but rather
that the string based walk always starts from the export root:

https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/4975b64efb5aa4248cbc3760312bbe08d6e71638/=
hw/9pfs/9p-local.c#L64

I guess that's something that could be changed in QEMU such that the walk
starts from FID's fs point, as the code already uses openat() to walk relat=
ive
to a file descriptor (for security reasons actually), Greg?

That alone would still not fix your use case though: things being moved on
host side. For this to work, it would require to already have a fd open on
host for the FID. This could be done by server for each FID as you suggeste=
d,
or it could be done by client by opening the FID.

Also keep in mind: once the open file descriptor limit on host is exhausted,
QEMU is forced to close older open file desciptors to keep the QEMU process
alive. So this might still break what you are trying to achieve there.

Having said that, I wonder whether it'd be simpler for server to track for
file tree changes (inotify API) and fix the pathes accordingly for host
side changes as well?
