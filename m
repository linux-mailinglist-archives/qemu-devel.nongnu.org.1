well, x86 (incl cpu,interrupt ctrls) also doesn't have architectural hotplu=
g.
It's just OEM managed to implement it regardless and then bothered to make
OS changes to work with that.
It's just ARM community doesn't want to go there at this point of time
but using above reasoning as justification for this series doesn't look goo=
d to me.

So what ARM would like to support is not CPU hotplug but rather a fixed
system with standby CPUs (that can be powered on/off on demand).
With ACPI spec amended to support that (MADT present/enabled changes), it's
good enough reason to add 'enabled' handling to acpi cpu-hotplug code inste=
ad
of inventing alternative one that would do almost the same.

But lets get rid of (can't/may not) language above and use standby CPUs rea=
soning
to avoid any confusion.

PS:
I'm taking about hw hotplug (at QEMU level) and not kernel hotplug
(where it's at logical cpu level).

that's where I have to disagree, vCPU is present when a corresponding QOM o=
bject
exists. Faking it's presence will only confuse at the end.

I get that you want to reuse device_add/del interface, but that leads to
pulling the leg here and there to make thing fit. That in short therm
(while someone remembers all tricks) might work for some, but long therm
it's not sustainable).

Maybe instead of pushing device_add/del, we should rather implement
standby CPU model here, as ARM folks expect it to be.
i.e. instead of device_add/del add 'enabled' property to ARM vCPU,
and let management to turn on/off vCPUs on demand.
(and very likely this model could be reused by other sock based platforms)
For end-user it would be the same as device_add/del (i.e. vCPU becomes usab=
le/unsable)

I'd bet it would simplify your ARM CPU hotplug series a lot,
since you won't have to fake vCPU object lifetime and do
non trivial tricks to make it all work.
Which it turn will make ARM hotplug series much more approachable
for reviewers /and whomever comes later across that code/.

Regardless of said, we would still need changes to ACPI cphp code,
see my comments inline.

I agree with Gavin, it's not CPU property/business, but a platform one.

Pass it as argument to cpu_hotplug_hw_init(),
and maybe rename to always_present.
Then make sure that it's configurable in GED (which calls the function),
and just turn it on for arm/virt machine.
Other platforms might want to use x86 approach with GED and have
vCPU actually disappearing. /loongson and maybe risc-v/

if cpus are not 'simulated', you will not need comments explaining that all

with always_present, it might be better to move field to CPUHotplugState
as it's not per vCPU anymore, and in standby case state->devs[i].cpu
should work as implicit present flag. (see below wrt doc first comment)

> +    bool is_enabled;
I'd move introduction of this field into a separate patch.

BTW: new ABI/fields accessible by guest should be described in
docs/specs/acpi_cpu_hotplug.rst.
It would be better to have the spec as patch 1st, that we all agree on
and then follow with implementation.
And also include there an expected workflow for standby case.=20
