Ok, so at time of VFIO device realize, QEMU is telling the kernel
to associate a physical SMMU, and its doing this with the virtual
SMMU attached to PXB parenting the VFIO device.

Yes, I concur the SMMU physical <-> virtual association should
be fixed, as long as the same VFIO device is always added to
the same virtual SMMU.

Although the ordering is at least predictable, I remain uncomfortable
about the idea of the virtual SMMU association with the physical SMMU
being a side effect of the VFIO device placement.

There is still the open door for admin mis-configuration that will not
be diagnosed. eg consider we attached VFIO device 1 from the host NUMA
node 1 to  a PXB associated with host NUMA node 0. As long as that's
the first VFIO device, the kernel will happily associate the physical
and guest SMMUs.

If we set the physical/guest SMMU relationship directly, then at the
time the VFIO device is plugged, we can diagnose the incorrectly
placed VFIO device, and better reason about behaviour.

I've another question about unplug behaviour..

 1. Plug a VFIO device for host SMMU 1 into a PXB with guest SMMU 1.
      => Kernel associates host SMMU 1 and guest SMMU 1 together
 2. Unplug this VFIO device
 3. Plug a VFIO device for host SMMU 2 into a PXB with guest SMMU 1.

Does the host/guest SMMU 1<-> 1 association remain set after step 2,
implying step 3 will fail ? Or does it get unset, allowing step 3
to succeed, and establish a new mapping host SMMU 2 to guest SMMU 1.

If step 2 does NOT break the association, do we preserve that
across a savevm+loadvm sequence of QEMU. If we don't, then step
3 would fail before the savevm, but succeed after the loadvm.

Explicitly representing the host SMMU association on the guest SMMU
config makes this behaviour unambiguous. The host / guest SMMU
relationship is fixed for the lifetime of the VM and invariant of
whatever VFIO device is (or was previously) plugged.

So I still go back to my general principle that automatic side effects
are an undesirable idea in QEMU configuration. We have a long tradition
of making everything entirely explicit to produce easily predictable
behaviour.

With regards,
Daniel
