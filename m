Ah! I see. Then you may probably want to ignore some of my responses to
other mail of this series :P

&gt; &gt; &gt; This is an early attempt to have backends<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; support dynamic fd mapping into shared<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The usecase for this is, e.g., to support<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; vhost-user-gpu RESOURCE_BLOB operations,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; or DAX Window request for virtio-fs. In<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; general, any operation where a backend<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would need to mmap an fd to a shared<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; memory so that the guest can access it.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I wanted to mention that this sentence confuses me because:<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; - The frontend will mmap an fd into the guest&#39;s memory space =

&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Sorry for the confused wording. It is true that the backend does not<b=

They are different concepts. Frontend is defined in the vhost-user spec<br>
