I have just sent a patch to expand the comments, let's discuss details ther=

All I needed was a practical way to allow the bounce buffer size limit
to be adjusted in the somewhat exotic situations where we're making
DMA requests to indirect memory regions (in my case it is a qemu
vfio-user server accessed by a client that can't or doesn't want to
provide direct memory-mapped access to its RAM). There was some
discussion about the nature of the parameter when I first proposed the
patch, see https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20230823092905.2259418-2-mnis=
sler@rivosinc.com/
- an x-prefixed experimental command-line parameter was suggested
there as a practical way to allow this without qemu committing to
supporting this forever. For the unlikely case that this parameter
proves popular, it can still be added to a stable API (or
alternatively we could discuss whether a large-enough limit is
feasible after all, or even consider DMA API changes to obviate the
need for bounce buffering).
