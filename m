Yeh, I can't actually remember much more about what I did back then!

Oh I hadn't; I think all of the stack of qemu's file abstractions had
changed in the ~10 years since I wrote my version!

It would probably be a good idea to keep track of what bugs
are in flight with it, and try it on a few RDMA cards to see
what problems get triggered.
I think I reported a few at the time, but I gave up after
feeling it was getting very hacky.

Yes, but even ignoring that (and the UFFDIO_CONTINUE idea you mention), if
the destination can issue an RDMA read itself, it doesn't need to send messages
to the source to ask for a page fetch; it just goes and grabs it itself,
that's got to be good for latency.
