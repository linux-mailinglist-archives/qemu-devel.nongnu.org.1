Hi Igor,

Given I guess we will soon be in the 9.2 cycle, revisiting this
to prepare a v6.

Added missing parameter descriptions for properties in here
and an additional patch for the ones missing for
generic initiators.  Another patch fixes the uint32_t fragilty
you pointed out for generic initiators (fixed here as well)

2 things remain, the docs and the question you are asked Markus.

See inline.

I've had a few passes and clearly still failing :(

Maybe an example is the way to go?  Does the following help?
(replacing the 'An example sentence' above).

#       For example, a CXL Memory device M is directly
#       plugged into a CXL root port P which is part of a
#       CXL root bridge B. To calculate latency from a CPU in
#       the host to the memory on M, the latency from that CPU
#       to the bridge B (and hence port P)* must be added
#       to the latency due to the CXL Link between P and M
#       (calculated from link status registers) and that from
#       the CXL port on device M to the actual memory (read from
#       CDAT via a mailbox on the device).
#       The CPU to root bridge latency (*) is provided by ACPI HMAT.
#       HMAT latency data is indexed with the combination of the
#       proximity domain for the CPU and that for the root bridge.
#       This node value is the root bridge part of that index pair.
