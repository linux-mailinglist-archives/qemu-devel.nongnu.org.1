Huh, that _shouldn't_ work.  The folio_is_secretmem() in gup_pte_range() is
supposed to prevent the "fast gup" path from getting secretmem pages.

Is this on an upstream kernel?  If so, and if you have bandwidth, can you f=
igure
out why that isn't working?  At the very least, I suspect the memfd_secret
maintainers would be very interested to know that it's possible to fast gup
secretmem.

We (and by "we", I really mean the pKVM folks) are also working on allowing
userspace to mmap() guest_memfd[*].  pKVM aside, the long term vision I hav=
e for
guest_memfd is to be able to use it for non-CoCo VMs, precisely for the sec=
urity
and robustness benefits it can bring.

What I am hoping to do with guest_memfd is get userspace to only map memory=
 it
needs, e.g. for emulated/synthetic devices, on-demand.  I.e. to get to a st=
ate
where guest memory is mapped only when it needs to be.  More below.

100% enhance guest_memfd.  If you're willing to wait long enough, pKVM migh=
t even
do all the work for you. :-)

The killer feature of guest_memfd is that it allows the guest mappings to b=
e a
superset of the host userspace mappings.  Most obviously, it allows mapping=
 memory
into the guest without mapping first mapping the memory into the userspace =
page
tables.  More subtly, it also makes it easier (in theory) to do things like=
 map
the memory with 1GiB hugepages for the guest, but selectively map at 4KiB g=
ranularity
in the host.  Or map memory as RWX in the guest, but RO in the host (I don'=
t have
a concrete use case for this, just pointing out it'll be trivial to do once
guest_memfd supports mmap()).

Every attempt to allow mapping VMA-based memory into a guest without it bei=
ng
accessible by host userspace emory failed; it's literally why we ended up
implementing guest_memfd.  We could teach KVM to do the same with memfd_sec=
ret,
but we'd just end up re-implementing guest_memfd.

memfd_secret obviously gets you a PoC much faster, but in the long term I'm=
 quite
sure you'll be fighting memfd_secret all the way.  E.g. it's not dumpable, =
it
deliberately allocates at 4KiB granularity (though I suspect the bug you fo=
und
means that it can be inadvertantly mapped with 2MiB hugepages), it has no l=
ine
of sight to taking userspace out of the equation, etc.

With guest_memfd on the other hand, everyone contributing to and maintainin=
g it
has goals that are *very* closely aligned with what you want to do.
