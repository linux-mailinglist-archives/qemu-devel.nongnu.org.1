Thanks for the heads-up.

Today, there are many functions use Error, but there are also functions that still follow old error handling patterns. When legacy functions call functions with Error, a common pattern is to use error_report_err() and return -1.

You mean like &error_fatal less the exit(1)?

As I wrote, the defects are all fixable.  However, there has been so
little use of &error_warn, and so much of it has been unclean or
otherwise undesirable.  It's obviously prone to misuse.  I think we're
better off without it.

See also the memo "Abuse of warnings for unhandled errors and
programming errors" I posted yesterday.

I replied there.

I'll be on vacation the next two weeks.
