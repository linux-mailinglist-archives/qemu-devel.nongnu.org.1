I didn't measure, but I guess yes it might. OTOH these structs may be

I think the ideal order is the opposite actually. So:
1) Try for the NIC to support _F_VRING_ASID, no translation needed by QEMU
2) Try reverse lookup from HVA to GPA. Since dataplane should fit
this, we should test this first
3) Look in SVQ host-only entries (SVQ, current shadow CVQ). It is the
control VQ, speed is not so important.

Overlapping regions may return the wrong SVQ IOVA though. We should
take extra care to make sure these are correctly handled. I mean,
there are valid translations in the tree unless the driver is buggy,
just may need to span many translations.

Yeah it makes sense to me. Hopefully we can even get rid of the id member.
