Ahhh, OK.  I'm pretty surprised by this, as I thought at least kubevirt
supported local migration somehow on top of libvirt.

Does it mean that cpr-transfer is a no-go in this case at least for Libvirt
to consume it (as cpr-* is only for local host migrations so far)?  Even if
all the rest issues we're discussing with cpr-exec, is that the only way to
go for Libvirt, then?
