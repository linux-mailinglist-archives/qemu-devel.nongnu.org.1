IIUC Fabiano is not asking you to drop them, but split them.  Split still
"requires" them to be present, as long as before the enablement patch.

For example, if you want you can put the channel changes into a separate
patch, but without enabling the feature.  That single patch (after applied)
should keep migration working as before.
