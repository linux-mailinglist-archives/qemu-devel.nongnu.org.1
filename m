Yes we can.

Juan will be back next Monday.  Before he left, he told me that he's
preparing the pull.

If next week there's still no pull from migration side then I suppose
someone should start to pick up patches and send PR. I would volunteer
myself already; I should have already perpared a pull a long time ago if I
got ack from Juan.  If Fabiano would like to that'll also be nice.  I don't
know how that works without delegation from the current (solo) maintainer,
though, for either of us to become a maintainer.

Before that, Fabiano can already propose a patch as at least a Reviewer
without the need of any delegation from anyone, as he already did lots of
work in that regard, assume he'll keep doing so to support the migration
subsystem.

I hope Juan will start to figure things out next week.

Thanks,
