Don't quote me out of context; I said It's an "awesome" first step,
though I qualified that we should treat it as "a guide towards
providing safe bindings between Rust and C". That is, as long as we
agree that it is not production quality code. Which it doesn't have to
be!

I never said that I want perfection before landing upstream. I want _a path=
_.

When I read "there was consensus in the community call that we won't
be writing Rust APIs for internal C QEMU interfaces; or at least,
that's not the goal"[1], then sorry but I think that it's better to
stick with C.

On the other hand, if there is a path towards proper, maintainable
Rust, then I am even okay even with committing something that
technically contains undefined behavior.

Let's not exaggerate the benefits: no pointers were converted to RAII
(Box<> or Rc<>) in the course of writing the Rust code; so there are
no memory errors that can be eliminated by the rewrite. In fact, new
memory errors can also be introduced, because safe Rust has stricter
aliasing rules than C.

This is not a problem! It's just that we need to be realistic to
understand where to focus next and why. To build our path.

(Also, a small correction so that we're on the same page on the fix:
it's reentrancy, not concurrency).
