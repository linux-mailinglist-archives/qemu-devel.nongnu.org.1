How confident do we think the new way is better than the old?

If it'll be 100% / always better, I agree we can consider removing the old.
But is it always better?  At least it consumes much more resources..

Otherwise, we can still leave that logic as-is but use a migration property
to turn it on only on new machines I think.

Besides, could you explain why the solution needs to be this complex?  My
previous question was that we sync dirty too less, while auto converge
relies on dirty information, so that means auto converge can be adjusted
too unfrequently.

However I wonder whether that can be achieved in a simpler manner by
e.g. invoke migration_bitmap_sync_precopy() more frequently during
migration, for example, in ram_save_iterate() - not every time but the
iterate() is invoked much more frequent, and maybe we can do sync from time
to time.

I also don't see why we need a separate thread, plus two new bitmaps, to
achieve this..  I didn't read in-depth yet, but I thought dirty sync
requires bql anyway, then I don't yet understand why the two bitmaps are
required.  If the bitmaps are introduced in the 1st patch, IMO it'll be
great to explain clearly on why they're needed here.

Thanks,
