I really dislike the drip-feeding of patches fixing C++ related
problems. As maintainers we've no idea what the end state is,
is this the last patch, or are there another 100 of these patches
to trickle out one at a time. Ultimately from the QEMU maintainer
POV anything related to C++ compatibility is a distraction, given
the general consensus has turned to Rust as the future for QEMU,
not C++.

If we're going to take any C++ compat cleanups as a courtesy to
ease burden of a downstream fork, then I'd like to see a complete
series in one go, so we can sensibly evaluate whether the end
state is something desirable from QEMU's POV.

With regards,
Daniel
