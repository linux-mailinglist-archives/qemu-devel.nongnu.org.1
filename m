Unfortunately, no documentation. The semantic is kind of complicated
which requires the userspace to know how a specific vhost device
works.

For example, userspace knows vhost-net works with tuntap. So it checks
part of the features with vhost-net and the rest with tuntap.

Yes.

For example vhost-net can return GSO related features.

If we don't do that, I don't know how we could achieve
under-indication as you mentioned.

Ok, I think I misunderstood you here. Maybe an RFC to see?
