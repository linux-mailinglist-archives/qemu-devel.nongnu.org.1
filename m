Why do we need to keep cpr working for existing qemu cmdlines?  We'll
already need to add more new cmdline options already anyway, right?

cpr-reboot wasn't doing it, and that made sense to me, so that new features
will require the user to opt-in for it, starting with changing its
cmdlines.

Ah ok, yes DMA can happen on the fly.

Guest mem is definitely the major DMA target and that can be covered by
-object memory-backend-*,shared=on cmdlines.

ROM is definitely not a DMA target.  So is VGA ram a target for, perhaps,
an assigned vGPU device?  Do we have a list of things that will need that?
Can we make them work somehow by sharing them like guest mem?

It'll be a complete tragedy if we introduced this whole thing only because
of some minority.  I want to understand whether there's any generic way to
solve this problem rather than this magical machine property.  IMHO it's
very not trivial to maintain.

Thanks.

For this one I think reusing -object interface (hopefully without
introducing a knob) would be a great step if that can fully describe what
cpr-exec is looking for.  E.g., when cpr-exec mode enabled it can sanity
check the memory backends making sure all things satisfy its need, and fail
migration otherwise upfront.
