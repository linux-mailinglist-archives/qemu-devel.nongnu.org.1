Both. a device needed to use hw-accel feature has to use an smmu that has that feature;
an emulated device can use such an smmu, but as mentioned in other threads,
if you start with all emulated in one smmu, if you hot-plug a (assigned) device,
it needs another smmu that has hw-accel features.
Keeping them split makes it easier at config time, and it may enable the code to be simpler...
but the other half of my brain wants common code paths with accel/emulate branches but
a different smmu instance will like simplify the smmu-(accel-)specific lookups.
