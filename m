Thanks for the report; I've investigated it. The cause of this specific
failure is that regime_el() doesn't return the right answer when code
is executing in the guest in Monitor mode. The effect is that because
regime_el() returns 1, not 3, we look at the wrong banked registers
and the page table walk fails when it should not. This is enough to fix:

However, while I was thinking about this I realised that there
are some problems with the design change this commit is trying
to do. The idea is that we now use the same MMU indexes for
Secure PL1&0 as we do for NonSecure PL1&0.

Small problem:
 That means we need to flush the TLBs at any point where the CPU
 state flips from one to the other. We already flush the TLB when
 SCR.NS is changed, but we don't flush the TLB when we take an
 exception from NS PL1&0 into Mon or when we return from Mon to
 NS PL1&0. Now we need to do that, so any time we call up into
 Mon and back we'll dump the TLBs, which is a bit sad.
 (Also we could skip flushing all these TLBs when NS changes.)

Larger problem:
 the ATS12NS* address translate instructions allow Mon code
 (which is Secure) to do a stage 1+2 page table walk for NS.
 I thought this was OK because do_ats_write() does a page
 table walk which doesn't use the TLBs, so because it can
 pass both the MMU index and also an ARMSecuritySpace argument
 we can tell the table walk that we want NS stage1+2, not S.
 But that means that all the code within the ptw that needs
 to find e.g. the regime EL cannot do so only with an
 mmu_idx -- all these functions like regime_sctlr(), regime_el(),
 etc would need to pass both an mmu_idx and the security_space,
 so they can tell whether this is a translation regime
 controlled by EL1 or EL3 (and so whether to look at SCTLR.S
 or SCTLR.NS, etc).

So now I'm wondering if this merge was a good idea after all.
Should we do all that replumbing required, or should we
instead revert this and take the "straightforward" approach
described in the commit message above of adding some extra
MMU indexes?

(I suspect that this commit is likely also the cause of
https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/2588 )
