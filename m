Users are not enough.  Only maintainers are.

At some point, people cared enough about RDMA in QEMU to contribute the
code.  That's why have the code.

To keep the code, we need people who care enough about RDMA in QEMU to
maintain it.  Without such people, the case for keeping it remains
dangerously weak, and no amount of talk or even benchmarks can change
that.
