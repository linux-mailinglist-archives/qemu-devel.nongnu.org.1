QEMU will disable extensions that are newer than a priv spec version that is set
by the CPU. IIUC the icicle board is running a sifive_u54 CPU by default. That
CPU has a priv spec version 1_10_0. The CPU is also enabling C.

We will enable zca if C is enabled. C and D enabled will also enable zcd. But
then the priv check will disabled both because zca and zcd have priv spec 1_12_0.

This is a side effect for a change that I did a few months ago. Back then we
weren't disabling stuff correctly. The warnings are annoying but are benign.
And apparently the sifive_u54 CPU is being inconsistent for some time and
we noticed just now.

Now, if the icicle board is supposed to have zca and zcd then we have a problem.
We'll need to discuss whether we move sifive_u54 CPU priv spec to 1_12_0 (I'm not
sure how this will affect other boards that uses this CPU) or remove this priv spec
disable code altogether from QEMU.


Thanks,

Daniel
