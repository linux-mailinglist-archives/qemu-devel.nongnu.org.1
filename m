The tutorial doesn't match reality since at least 2013.  Repairing it
involves fixing the following issues:

* Update for commit 6d327171551 (aio / timers: Remove alarm timers):
  replace the broken examples.  Instead of having one for returning a
  struct and another for returning a list of structs, do just one for
  the latter.  This resolves the FIXME added in commit
  e218052f928 (aio / timers: De-document -clock) back in 2014.

* Update for commit 895a2a80e0e (qapi: Use 'struct' instead of 'type'
  in schema).

* Update for commit 3313b6124b5 (qapi: add qapi2texi script): add
  required documentation to the schema snippets, and drop section
  "Command Documentation".

* Update for commit a3c45b3e629 (qapi: New special feature flag
  "unstable"): supply the required feature, deemphasize the x- prefix.

* Update for commit dd98234c059 (qapi: introduce x-query-roms QMP
  command): rephrase from "add new command" to "examine existing
  command".

* Update for commit 9492718b7c0 (qapi misc: Elide redundant has_FOO in
  generated C): hello-world's message argument no longer comes with a
  has_message, add a second argument that does.

* Update for moved and renamed files.

While there, update QMP version output to current output.

 There are a number of things to be noticed:

-2. As specified in the schema file, the function returns a QemuAlarmClock
-   instance and takes no arguments (besides the "errp" one, which is mandatory
-   for all QMP functions)
-3. The "clock" variable (which will point to our QAPI type instance) is
-   allocated by the regular g_malloc0() function. Note that we chose to
-   initialize the memory to zero. This is recommended for all QAPI types, as
-   it helps avoiding bad surprises (specially with booleans)
-4. Remember that "next_deadline" is optional? Non-pointer optional
-   members have a 'has_TYPE_NAME' member that should be properly set
+1. Type OptionRomInfo is automatically generated by the QAPI framework,
+   its members correspond to the type's specification in the schema
+   file
+2. Type OptionRomInfoList is also generated.  It's a singly linked
+   list.
+3. As specified in the schema file, the function returns a
+   OptionRomInfoList, and takes no arguments (besides the "errp" one,
+   which is mandatory for all QMP functions)
+4. The returned object is dynamically allocated
+5. All strings are dynamically allocated. This is so because QAPI also
+   generates a function to free its types and it cannot distinguish
+   between dynamically or statically allocated strings
+6. Remember that "bootindex" is optional? As a non-pointer optional
+   member, it comes with a 'has_bootindex' member that needs to be set
    by the implementation, as shown above
-5. Even static strings, such as "alarm_timer->name", should be dynamically
-   allocated by the implementation. This is so because the QAPI also generates
-   a function to free its types and it cannot distinguish between dynamically
-   or statically allocated strings
-6. You have to include "qapi/qapi-commands-misc.h" in qemu-timer.c
 
 Time to test the new command. Build qemu, run it as described in the "Testing"
 section and try this::

-Returning Lists
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-For this example, we're going to return all available methods for the timer
-alarm, which is pretty much what the command-line option "-clock ?" does,
-except that we're also going to inform which method is in use.
-
-This first step is to define a new type::
-
- ##
- # @TimerAlarmMethod
- #
- # Timer alarm method information.
- #
- # @method-name: The method's name.
- #
- # @current: true if this alarm method is currently in use, false otherwise
- #
- # Since: 1.0
- ##
- { 'type': 'TimerAlarmMethod',
-   'data': { 'method-name': 'str', 'current': 'bool' } }
-
-The command will be called "query-alarm-methods", here is its schema
-specification::
-
- ##
- # @query-alarm-methods
- #
- # Returns information about available alarm methods.
- #
- # Returns: a list of @TimerAlarmMethod for each method
- #
- # Since: 1.0
- ##
- { 'command': 'query-alarm-methods', 'returns': ['TimerAlarmMethod'] }
-
-Notice the syntax for returning lists "'returns': ['TimerAlarmMethod']", this
-should be read as "returns a list of TimerAlarmMethod instances".
-
-The C implementation follows::
-
- TimerAlarmMethodList *qmp_query_alarm_methods(Error **errp)
- {
-     TimerAlarmMethodList *method_list = NULL;
-     const struct qemu_alarm_timer *p;
-     bool current = true;
-
-     for (p = alarm_timers; p->name; p++) {
-         TimerAlarmMethod *value = g_malloc0(*value);
-         value->method_name = g_strdup(p->name);
-         value->current = current;
-         QAPI_LIST_PREPEND(method_list, value);
-         current = false;
-     }
-
-     return method_list;
- }
-
-The most important difference from the previous examples is the
-TimerAlarmMethodList type, which is automatically generated by the QAPI from
-the TimerAlarmMethod type.
-
-Each list node is represented by a TimerAlarmMethodList instance. We have to
-allocate it, and that's done inside the for loop: the "info" pointer points to
-an allocated node. We also have to allocate the node's contents, which is
-stored in its "value" member. In our example, the "value" member is a pointer
-to an TimerAlarmMethod instance.
-
-Notice that the "current" variable is used as "true" only in the first
-iteration of the loop. That's because the alarm timer method in use is the
-first element of the alarm_timers array. Also notice that QAPI lists are handled
-by hand and we return the head of the list.
-
-Now Build qemu, run it as explained in the "Testing" section and try our new
-command::
-
- { "execute": "query-alarm-methods" }
- {
-     "return": [
-         {
-             "current": false,
-             "method-name": "unix"
-         },
-         {
-             "current": true,
-             "method-name": "dynticks"
-         }
-     ]
- }
-
-The HMP counterpart is a bit more complex than previous examples because it
-has to traverse the list, it's shown below for reference::
-
- void hmp_info_alarm_methods(Monitor *mon)
- {
-     TimerAlarmMethodList *method_list, *method;
-     Error *err = NULL;
-
-     method_list = qmp_query_alarm_methods(&err);
-     if (hmp_handle_error(mon, err)) {
-         return;
-     }
-
-     for (method = method_list; method; method = method->next) {
-         monitor_printf(mon, "%c %s\n", method->value->current ? '*' : ' ',
-                                        method->value->method_name);
-     }
-
-     qapi_free_TimerAlarmMethodList(method_list);
- }
-
 Writing a debugging aid returning unstructured text
 ---------------------------------------------------
 
 As discussed in section `Modelling data in QAPI`_, it is required that
 commands expecting machine usage be using fine-grained QAPI data types.
 The exception to this rule applies when the command is solely intended
-as a debugging aid and allows for returning unstructured text. This is
-commonly needed for query commands that report aspects of QEMU's
-internal state that are useful to human operators.
+as a debugging aid and allows for returning unstructured text, such as
+a query command that report aspects of QEMU's internal state that are
+useful only to human operators.
 
-In this example we will consider a simplified variant of the HMP
-command ``info roms``. Following the earlier rules, this command will
-need to live under the ``x-`` name prefix, so its QMP implementation
-will be called ``x-query-roms``. It will have no parameters and will
-return a single text string::
-
- { 'struct': 'HumanReadableText',
-   'data': { 'human-readable-text': 'str' } }
+In this example we will consider the existing QMP command
+``x-query-roms`` in qapi/machine.json.  It has no parameters and
+returns a ``HumanReadableText``::
 
+ ##
+ # @x-query-roms:
+ #
+ # Query information on the registered ROMS
+ #
+ # Features:
+ #
+ # @unstable: This command is meant for debugging.
+ #
+ # Returns: registered ROMs
+ #
+ # Since: 6.2
+ ##
  { 'command': 'x-query-roms',
-   'returns': 'HumanReadableText' }
+   'returns': 'HumanReadableText',
+   'features': [ 'unstable' ] }
 
-The ``HumanReadableText`` struct is intended to be used for all
-commands, under the ``x-`` name prefix that are returning unstructured
-text targeted at humans. It should never be used for commands outside
-the ``x-`` name prefix, as those should be using structured QAPI types.
+The ``HumanReadableText`` struct is defined in qapi/common.json as a
+struct with a string member. It is intended to be used for all

+feature's documentation states why the command is unstable.  WE
+commonly use a ``x-`` command name prefix to make lack of stability
+obvious to human users.
