I agree with your analysis, however I don't think such use case exists in
practise..

I added below and qemu's qtests run all smooth:

 void address_space_init(AddressSpace *as, MemoryRegion *root, const char *name)
 {
+    assert(memory_region_transaction_depth == 0 &&
+           memory_region_update_pending == false);
     memory_region_ref(root);
     as->root = root;
     as->current_map = NULL;

We can either keep the assertion (until it'll trigger any time, but I doubt
it..), or we can also solve this by other ways, I can think of two right
now:

  (1) Make sure address_space_init() skips the last two steps to update
      topology and ioeventfds if memory_region_transaction_depth>0.

  (2) Introduce one more field for MemoryRegion, which is to allocate a
      globally unique KEY for the flat_views hash, only needed if the MR
      can be root candidates.

(2) will need more work, as we may need to have some way to make sure the
allocator will not generate duplicate KEYs (hence u64 counter may not be
ideal, as it may provide duplicates when wraps over u64.. even though I
also don't know if people will hit it at all..).

So I wonder if we can just keep the solution (0) above, which is to assert
it.

Yes it'll be easier to debug indeed.  However IMHO this is still a bad plan
to wait for it whenever overlooked.  It'll still be a disaster if a
customer crashed on the NULL pointer reference somewhere, so IMHO we should
avoid the first crash from design.

I confess I also added some assertions above.  However since we don't have
a huge lot of object_unparent(mr) use cases, we can walk all of them and
make sure the assertion will never happen.  IMHO it's still slightly better
than remote pointer resets.

I also wonder if you have good ideas on above, hence a better solution than
proposal (0,1,2) to avoid what you raised as problems.

Thanks,
