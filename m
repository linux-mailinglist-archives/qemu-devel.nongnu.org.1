Thanks for the patches!

I left some comments on the cover letter and throughout the series.

The main points are that we need to support a release spec (draft is
ok, but it needs to be tagged as a version). On top of that we want to
try and keep the CSR changes in target/riscv. We don't want to be
including the hw/intc code all over the place. time_helper.c for
example is how the ACLINT works, where we try to keep as much of the
CPU code in target/riscv.

Also we will need extension checks for all of the relevant CLIC
extensions. Guest code should not notice any changes after this series
unless they enable the CLIC extensions.
