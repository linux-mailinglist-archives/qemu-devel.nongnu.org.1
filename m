We recently improved the MAINTAINERS update warning to show the files
that trigger it.  Example:

    WARNING: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
    #105:
    deleted file mode 100644

improved to

    WARNING: added, moved or deleted file(s):

      migration/threadinfo.h
      migration/threadinfo.c

    Does MAINTAINERS need updating?

Unfortunately, this made things worse with --terse, as only the first
line of each warning is shown then.

    WARNING: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?

became

    WARNING: added, moved or deleted file(s):

Adjust the warning text to

    WARNING: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
      migration/threadinfo.h
      migration/threadinfo.c

so we get the exact same warning as we used to with --terse.
