Gentle ping.

I'm less worried about hitting this cycle for this than the Generic Port
work but this is the missing piece for ensuring we can test the kernel
code that builds NUMA description for CXL devices. I'd like to have
the full solution for that upstream.

The bulk of this is a refactor with functional changes limited to
the CXL components.
