who said the oldest Linux QEMU supports is from 4.5? what about 2.x kernel?

Besides, not only the Linux guest, whatever guest OS is, it will be 
broken if the guest is using kvmclock and QEMU starts to drop support of 
kvmclock.

So, again, hard NAK to drop the support of kvmclock. It breaks existing 
guests that use kvmclock. You cannot force people to upgrade their 
existing VMs to use kvmclock2 instead of kvmclock.
