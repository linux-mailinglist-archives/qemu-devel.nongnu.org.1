Igor, thanks for the detailed comments. Sorry for a bit delay of the reply, I
was checking the code to understand it better :)

Agreed.

I would say #1 is the ideal model because the read_ack_register is the bottleneck
and it should be scaled up to max_cpus. In that way, the bottleneck can be avoided
from the bottom. Another benefit with #1 is the error can be delivered immediately
to the vCPU where the error was raised. This matches with the syntax of SEA to me.

#2 still has the risk to saturate the multiple error status blocks if there are
high rate of errors as you said. Besides, the vCPU where read_ack_register is acknoledged
can be different from the vCPU where the error is raised, violating the syntax of
SEA.

#3's drawback is to violate the syntax of SEA, similar to #2.

However, #2/#3 wouldn't be that complicated to #1. I didn't expect big surgery to
GHES module, but it seems there isn't perfect solution without a big surgery.
I would vote for #1 to resolve the issue from the ground. What do you think, Igor?
I'm also hoping Jonathan and Mauro can provide their preference.

Sure. I won't start the coding until the solution is confirmed. All the followup
work will base on Mauro's series.
