The description of feature @unstable is three paragraphs.  The second
and third became part of the description by accident in commit
9fb49daabfb (qapi: Mark unstable QMP parts with feature 'unstable').

The second paragraph describes a defect in terms of the
implementation.  Fine, but doesn't belong into user-facing
documentation.  Turn it into a TODO section.

Rewrite everything else for clarity and completeness.

-# Dynamically reconfigure the block driver state graph.  It can be
-# used to add, remove, insert or replace a graph node.  Currently only
-# the Quorum driver implements this feature to add or remove its

+# Dynamically reconfigure the block driver state graph.
 #
-# If @node is specified, it will be inserted under @parent.  @child
-# may not be specified in this case.  If both @parent and @child are
-# specified but @node is not, @child will be detached from @parent.
+# Currently only supports adding and deleting quorum children.  A
+# child will be added at the end of the list of children.  Its
+# contents *must* be consistent with the other childrens' contents.
+# Deleting a child that is not last in the list of children is
+# problematic, because it "renumbers" the children following it.
