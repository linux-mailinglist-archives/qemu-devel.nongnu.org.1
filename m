The actor of object_ref() is the owner of the memory region also in this 
case. We are calling object_ref() on behalf of mr->owner so we use 
mr->refcount iff mr->owner == subregion->owner. In this sense there is 
only one user of mr->refcount even after this change.

Yes, I agree.

There is one principle we must satisfy in general: keep a reference to a 
memory region if it is visible to the guest.

It is safe to call memory_region_del_subregion() and to trigger the 
finalization of subregions when the container is not referenced because 
they are no longer visible. This is not true for the other way around; 
even when subregions are not referenced by anyone else, they are still 
visible to the guest as long as the container is visible to the guest. 
It is not safe to unref and finalize them in such a case.

A memory region and its owner will leak if a memory region kept visible 
for a too long period whether the chain of reference contains a 
container/subregion relationship or not.
