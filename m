If the storage itself is broken, there's clearly nothing we can do. But
the thing is we're accessing it from two distinct hosts. So while it may
work on the source, it can be broken on the destination. For example,
connection between the destination host and the storage may be broken.
Not sure how often this can happen in real life, but we have a bug
report that (artificially) breaking storage access on the destination
results in paused VM on the source which can only be killed.

So I believe we should do better if reasonably possible. People don't
like losing their VMs just because they tried to migrate and something
failed.
