Thanks for looking at this. I've uploaded the full log here: 
http://zero.eik.bme.hu/~balaton/qemu/aos-lsi-scsi.log.xz
but not sure you'd get more info from it as it seems to be working up to 
the error. This happens short after boot when the driver is started which 
seems to be going OK but when first accessing the device then it runs into 
the error. I don't know how this controller works so can't really tell 
what would be correct behaviour here.

Regards,
BALATON Zoltan
