Good interfaces are hard!

QOM path then.

Let's start with an example.  Not to put it into the doc comment, only
to help me understand what you need.  Hopefully I can then assist with
improving the interface and/or its documentation.

This is mostly greek to me :)  Bit I don't think it's too much.
