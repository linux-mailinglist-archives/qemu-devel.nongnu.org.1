I agree w/Jason & Nicolin: different vSMMUs for pass-through devices than emulated, & vice-versa.
Not mixing... because... of the next agreement:

I agree with Eric that 'accel' isn't needed -- this should be ascertained from the pSMMU that a physical device is attached to.
Now... how does vfio(?; why not qemu?) layer determine that? -- where are SMMUv3 'accel' features exposed either: a) in the device struct (for the smmuv3) or (b) somewhere under sysfs? ... I couldn't find anything under either on my g-h system, but would appreciate a ptr if there is.
and like Eric, although 'accel' is better than the original 'nested', it's non-obvious what accel feature(s) are being turned on, or not.
In fact, if broken accel hw occurs ('if' -> 'when'), how should it be turned off? ... if info in the kernel, a kernel boot-param will be needed;
if in sysfs, a write to 0 an enable(disable) it maybe an alternative as well.
Bottom line: we need a way to (a) ascertain the accel feature (b) a way to disable it when it is broken,
so qemu's smmuv3 spec will 'just work'.
[This may also help when migrating from a machine that has accel working to one that does not.[

... and when an emulated device is assigned a vSMMU, there are no accel features ... unless we have tunables like batch iotlb invalidation for perf reasons, which can be viewed as an 'accel' option.
