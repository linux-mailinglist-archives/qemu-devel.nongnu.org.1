ICYMI, Phil M-D has already pulled patches 1 & 2, and Stefan has merged
them into staging & master.

As I understand it, Phil M-D was also in the process of merging the rest of
v16 of this series before discovering the GICv3 dependency/Kconfig issue:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/8554330d-fd9b-4fa5-b37c-161f70b71f7d@lin=
aro.org/

I don't really mind either way who merges this, but he might have some more
thoughts on the matter - there might be a specific reason he's so far only
picked up those two patches. :-)

te:<br>
&gt; This patch set introduces a new ARM and macOS HVF specific machine typ=
e<br>
&gt; called &quot;vmapple&quot;. There are also some patches for fixing XHC=
I spec<br>
&gt; compliance issues and adding a workaround to a quirk in the macOS gues=
t&#39;s<br>
&gt; XHCI driver.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The vmapple machine type approximates the configuration in macOS&#39;s=
 own<br>
&gt; Virtualization.framework when running arm64 macOS guests. In addition =
to<br>
&gt; generic components such as a GICv3 and an XHCI USB controller, it<br>
&gt; includes nonstandard extensions to the virtio block device, a special<=
br>
&gt; &quot;hardware&quot; aes engine, a configuration device, a pvpanic var=
iant, a<br>
&gt; &quot;backdoor&quot; interface, and of course the apple-gfx paravirtua=
lised display<br>
&gt; adapter.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The macOS guest initially did not work well with QEMU&#39;s XHCI contr=
oller,<br>
&gt; which required some investigation, bug fixing, and a work-around.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Essentially, the macOS driver attempts to use XHCI event rings 1 and 2=
<br>
&gt; even when there is only a single pin-based interrupt available. The<br=
>
&gt; interrupts for rings 1 and 2 are dropped, and so events are only handl=
ed<br>
&gt; after a timeout. The driver appears to expect the device to act as if<=
br>
&gt; interrupter mapping was not supported - the spec only mentions that<br=
>
&gt; interrupter mapping should be disabled if only one interrupter is<br>
&gt; enabled, not one interrupt, although there is potential ambiguity in<b=
r>
&gt; the spec&#39;s wording around enabling and disabling interrupters.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; In any case, this investigation has led to 3 changes:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 * The spec requires that modulo arithmetic be used for selecting=
<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 the MSI vector to notify from the interrupter/event ring =
index.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 (Patch 1)<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 * The spec requires that all events be directed at ring 0 if<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 interrupter mapping is not available; the condition for t=
his<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 mentioned in the spec is when there is only 1 interrupter=
<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 available. (Patch 2)<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 * A property is added to the PCI XHCI controller classes to disa=
ble<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 interrupter mapping when using pin-based interrupts. This=
 makes<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 the macOS guest drivers work. (Patch 9) This is enabled i=
n the<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 vmapple machine type, which does not offer MSI(-X) suppor=
t.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; There are currently a few limitations to the vmapple machine. These<br=
>
&gt; aren&#39;t intrinsic, just imperfect emulation of the VZF, but it&#39;=
s good<br>
&gt; enough to be just about usable for some purposes:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 * macOS 12 guests only. Versions 13+ currently fail during early=
 boot.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 * macOS 11+ arm64 hosts only, with hvf accel. (Perhaps some diff=
erences<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 between Apple M series CPUs and TCG&#39;s aarch64 impleme=
ntation? macOS<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 hosts only because ParavirtualizedGraphics.framework is a=
 black box<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 implementing most of the logic behind the apple-gfx devic=
e.)<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 * The guest OS must first be provisioned using Virtualization.fr=
amework;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 the disk images can subsequently be used in Qemu. (See do=
cs.)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Previous versions of this series also included the macOS PV graphics<b=
r>
&gt; device (&quot;apple-gfx&quot;); those patches have already been merged=
, so<br>
&gt; the title has been changed. Previous iteration:<br>

41223221645.29911-1-phil@philjordan.eu/</a><br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Furthermore, the XHCI fixes and workaround were previously submitted<b=
r>
&gt; as a separate patch set, of which a few patches have also been merged.=

41227121336.25838-1-phil@philjordan.eu/</a><br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Finally, I&#39;ve included one of Philippe Mathieu-Daud=C3=A9&#39;s GI=
Cv3 patches<br>
&gt; which arose out of the discovery that the software GICv3 dependency<br=

&gt; was missing when building v16 and earlier versions of this series<br>

is now<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 const and no longer carries an end-of-list marker.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 * The indentation fix (previously 5/6) has already been merged, =
so is no<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 longer included.<br>

 (4/6)<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 * 6/6: Moved the compat global property table into vmapple patch=
 set -v16;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 we now just add the conditional-intr-mapping property to =
it in this<br>

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 TYPE_XHCI_PCI rather than only the TYPE_QEMU_XHCI device =
specifically.<br>
&gt; <br>

&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 * Rebased on latest upstream (with minor conflict fixes)<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 * apple-gfx, GPEX, and ui/cocoa patches dropped as they have bee=
n merged.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 * Unmerged patches from xhci series v3 combined into this series=
.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 * vmapple machine type: Explicitly depend on software GICv3.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 * vmapple machine type: Enable the new XHCI PCI conditional-intr=
-mapping<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 property via the machine type&#39;s global compat propert=
y table.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 * Integrated Philippe&#39;s patch on renaming the GICv3&#39;s co=
nfusing config name,<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 and removing its TCG dependency. (It&#39;s needed with HV=
F too.)<br>
