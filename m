New device models have vmstate; we don't actively test that
savevm/loadvm works, but as with most device models we fix bugs
if anybody reports them. Some older device models simply omit
the vmstate struct completely (which results in the guest not
behaving right after savevm/loadvm); a few at least register a
migration blocker. Usually if somebody's doing a refactoring
and cleanup of an old device they'll add the vmstate while they're
doing it.

Any device which is used by a versioned machine type is supposed
to have the vmstate support.

Yeah, there's no reason for us to make our downstreams' lives
harder; the "not supported upstream" part is a mix of
(a) we don't test it so it probably doesn't work and
(b) we're not going to insist on patch submitters tying themselves
in knots over trying to implement a level of compatibility for
a device when we don't advertise that it's supposed to work
