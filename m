I forgot to update the doc file, I'll attach one more patch when repost,
attached here for early comments.

I also forgot to copy QAPI maintainers; It turns out I start to forget how
to send patches.. sorry. I'll do that in v2.

Subject: [PATCH] migration/docs: Update postcopy recover session for SETUP
 phase

Firstly, the "Paused" state was added in the wrong place before. The state
machine section was describing PostcopyState, rather than MigrationStatus.
Drop the Paused state descriptions.

Then in the postcopy recover session, add more information on the state
machine for MigrationStatus in the lines.  Add the new RECOVER_SETUP phase.
