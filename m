Yep, python's autodoc has such a knob to use the debugging log for
this. I just want to point out that avoiding the intermediate file
on-disk is actually the mechanism by which I can preserve source
lines, so this is how it's gotta be.

I build an intermediate doc in-memory with source filenames and source
lines along with the modified doc block content so that ReST errors
can be tracked back directly to the QAPI json files. If we saved to
disk and parsed that, it'd obliterate that information.

Yeah. Future work, if we want it. Otherwise, I think it's not *too*
bad to hotlink to the return arg type; but if that's info that you
want to "hide" from the user API, I get it - we can work on squanching
that in too. (For a follow-up though, please.)

Weird. I still don't understand where that info is getting cached, to
be honest ...

I dunno. That's up to you and Kevin, I think? For now, I'm just
following "What we've got" but with cross-referencing and indexing
improvements. Those improvements require distinguishing QMP and QSD
somehow. Adding simple namespace support seems like the most flexible
*and* dead simple way to do it. Other improvements can come later if
desired, I think.

If you need help adding Sphinx features to make it happen, you know
where I live.

Out of scope for me I'm afraid, but clue me in to the discussion
if/when you have it.

Ah, so you are debating a type of pragma or other meta-include that
just fishes out specific definitions? That could work, I think - I'm
not sure how the QAPI Schema end would look, but the Sphinx domain
could provide a meta-directive for adding a QSD support tag to
specific entities or some such thing, and the single QMP reference
could advertise a qemu-storage-daemon support flag.

Or something - I'm not really privy to the big picture when it comes
to how we want to handle QMP modularization and differentiation
between different binaries.

For the sake of argument, let's say we forbid everything except
arg/features from definitions destined to be used as base/inherited
types. This would be very easy to enforce at the qapidoc level where
the doc inlining is performed by yelping when the base type contains
additional documentation sections.

Now, in the real world, maybe sometimes those sections are useful and
we don't want to get rid of them, esp. because they may contain useful
documentation that we don't want to duplicate in the source files.

My plan is to just forbid them at first and enumerate the cases where
they occur, then decide which ones are better off being moved
elsewhere or explicitly tolerated. The generator's tolerance can be
adjusted accordingly and we can formulate a rule for exactly how doc
blocks are combined and merged. I think it won't be a problem to
enforce it programmatically.

I'll get back to you on how often and precisely where these cases
occur so you can take a look and see how you feel.
