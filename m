Neither do I.

I'm not aware of such existing (ab)use of chardev IDs.

Looks like an instance of the old "how to set properties of onboard
devices" problem.  Still no good solution.

Machine properties that are aliases of the to onboard device properties
we want to set is a solution we used in places.  Requires plumbing, as
you wrote.

> Do we have a neat way to specify per-cpu CPU properties that I'm missing?

I'm not aware of a better solution.
