Not so fast. Individual source files may be under the BSD license, but
those source files are rarely buildable & usable in isolation. They will
consume APIs in other parts of QEMU which are under the GPL license, and
thus the combined work will be under the GPL per that wiki License page
above.

IOW, if you wanted to takes pieces which are BSD license and use them
exclusively under BSD in a combined work, you would need to re-implement
any other code it depends on which was not also BSD licensed. This is
unlikely to be a sensible investment of time IMHO.

Again, QEMU as a whole is under the GPL-v2-only, because the process of
building QEMU into a functional binary pulls together code under many
licenses with GPL-v2-only being the one that sets the overall terms in
QEMU's case.

Since AFAICT unicorn engine has copied in the entire of the QEMU source
tree, and many of the BSD bits of QEMU will consume other GPL code, I
don't see a possibility to change. Individual source files can be under
a variety of licenses, but the combined work will inevitably be under
the GPL-v2-only.

With regards,
Daniel
