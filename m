The commit message talks about ".. Note::", but you actually use

You're capitalizing the beginning of the note text.  Good, because the

Your commit message lists a number of conversions.  This one isn't among
them.

The next patch reverts the indentation and drops "Note: ":

   -#     Note: This example has been shortened as the real response is too
   -#     long.
   +# This example has been shortened as the real response is too long.

Hmm.  Swap the two patches?  Perhaps not worth the bother now.  Squash
the next patch's change into this one?

I love this, and want it merged as soon as possible.  Can we spin this
off into its own series along with its dependencies?  Feel free to throw
in uncontroversial small fry.  Perhaps

    qapi: linter fixups
    docs/qapidoc: delint a tiny portion of the module
    qapi/parser: preserve indentation in QAPIDoc sections
    qapi/parser: fix comment parsing immediately following a doc block
    docs/qapidoc: fix nested parsing under untagged sections
    qapi: fix non-compliant JSON examples
    qapi: ensure all errors sections are uniformly typset
    qapi: convert "Note" sections to plain rST
    qapi: convert "Example" sections to rST

Has just one trivial conflict for me.
