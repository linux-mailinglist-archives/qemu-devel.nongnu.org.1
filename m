Ok, now I get you better. Let me start again from a different angle :).

vhost_vring_addr is already part of the API that QEMU uses between
itself and vhost devices, all vhost-kernel, vhost-user and vhost-vdpa.
To make non-backward compatible changes to it is impossible, as it
involves changes in all of these elements.

QEMU and DPDK, using vhost-user, already send and receive packed
virtqueues addresses using the current structure layout. QEMU's
hw/virtio/vhost.c:vhost_virtqueue_set_addr already sets vq->desc,
vq->avail and vq->user, which has the values of the desc, driver and
device. In that sense, I recommend not to modify it.

On the other hand, DPDK's vhost_virtqueue is not the same struct as
vhost_vring_addr. It is internal to DPDK so it can be modified. We
need to do something similar for the SVQ, yes.

To do that union trick piece by piece in VhostShadowVirtqueue is
possible, but it requires modifying all the usages of the current
vring. I think it is easier for us to follow the kernel's
virtio_ring.c model, as it is a driver too, and create a vring_packed.
We can create an anonymous union and suffix all members with a _packed
so we don't need to modify current split usage.

Let me know what you think.

But you need the if/else anyway, as the members are not vring_desc_t
but vring_packed_desc, and same with vring_avail_t and vring_used_t
with struct vring_packed_desc_event. Or am I missing something?

Thanks!
