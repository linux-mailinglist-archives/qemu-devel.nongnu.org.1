Yeah as far as I can tell in all the situations we do this with icount
we should always be exiting the loop anyway. Changing our mind about
when the next time slice ends while in a block would break things. For
IO triggered events we already know the block is about to end anyway and
things be rectified.

I did wonder if pmuevents (under icount) might suffer because they call
timer_mod_anticipate_ns in pmccntr_op_finish but my kvm-unit-test smoke
test was fine.

So:
