I was referring to Peter Maydell's example, where the MR can be used
outside of its owner.  In that case manual operation is a must before
finalize(), as finalize() can only make sense to resolve internal links
automatically.

But now knowing that you're explicitly mentioning "deallocation" rather
than "finalize()", and you're aware of diff between deallocation
v.s. finalize(), I suppose I misunderstood what you meant, and now I'm not
sure I get what you're suggesting.

I assume we're talking about embeded MRs, then I agree until here.

I don't get it here.

We're still taking in the context of calling finalize() before property
list being detached, right?

In that case detachment of the property list should be the last thing we
do.  What unexpected side effect do we worry about?

To be explicit, IMHO the right sequence of doing it is (which remove
property later):

        static void object_finalize(void *data)
        {
                Object *obj = data;
                TypeImpl *ti = obj->class->type;

                object_deinit(obj, ti);
                object_property_del_all(obj); <------------ [1]

                g_assert(obj->ref == 0);
                g_assert(obj->parent == NULL);
                if (obj->free) {
                        obj->free(obj);
                }
        }

We're talking about MR automatically unlink both mr->container and
mr->subregions at [1] (comparing to the old world where we only auto detach
mr->subregions).  After that it calls obj->free() and memory is freed.
I don't see what can be the side effect you mentioned.

The only side effect I can think of is when the container MR finalize() is
called later than the subregion's, then the container will see empty
mr->subregions on its own, but that's exactly what we want to work out
here: we want to make sure mr finalize() work in random order.
