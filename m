Hi Michael,

Please ignore the patch series I sent yesterday:
	https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20241207093922.1efa02ec@foz.lan/T/#t

The git range was wrong, and it was supposed to be v6. This is the right one.
It is based on the top of v9.2.0-rc3.

Could you please merge this series for ACPI stuff? All patches were already
reviewed by Igor. The changes against v4 are just on some patch descriptions,
plus the addition of Reviewed-by. No Code changes.

Thanks,
Mauro

During the development of a patch series meant to allow GHESv2 error injections,
it was requested a change on how CPER offsets are calculated, by adding a new
BIOS pointer and reworking the GHES logic. See:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/cover.1726293808.git.mchehab+huawei@kernel.org/

Such change ended being a big patch, so several intermediate steps are needed,
together with several cleanups and renames.

As agreed duing v10 review, I'll be splitting the big patch series into separate pull 
requests, starting with the cleanup series. This is the first patch set, containing
only such preparation patches.

The next series will contain the shift to use offsets from the location of the
HEST table, together with a migration logic to make it compatible with 9.1.

---

v5:
- some changes at patches description and added some R-B;
- no changes at the code.

v4:
- merged a patch renaming the function which calculate offsets to:
  get_hw_error_offsets(), to avoid the need of such change at the next
  patch series;
- removed a functional change at the logic which makes
  the GHES record generation more generic;
- a couple of trivial changes on patch descriptions and line break cleanups.

v3:
- improved some patch descriptions;
- some patches got reordered to better reflect the changes;
- patch v2 08/15: acpi/ghes: Prepare to support multiple sources on ghes
  was split on two patches. The first one is in this cleanup series:
      acpi/ghes: Change ghes fill logic to work with only one source
  contains just the simplification logic. The actual preparation will
  be moved to this series:
     https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/cover.1727782588.git.mchehab+huawei@kernel.org/

v2: 
- some indentation fixes;
- some description improvements;
- fixed a badly-solved merge conflict that ended renaming a parameter.
