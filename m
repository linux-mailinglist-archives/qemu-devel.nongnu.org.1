So... I wonder this is really the right direction.

To be specific:

Over in split-accel-land we recently had a bit of a kerfuffle over TCG registering its 
MemoryListener with all of the per-cpu address spaces and HVF not doing so.  Things get 
even more complicated when one finds out that some MemoryListener callbacks are only used 
with "global" address spaces and some are only used with the per-cpu address spaces.

On reflection, it seems to me that no address spaces should be owned by the cpus.  All 
address spaces should be owned by the board model, and it should be the board model that 
configures the address spaces used by each cpu.

If we do this then address spaces, and even the array of address spaces, may be created 
once by the board, shared between all (relevant) cpus, and not destroyed by cpu unplug.

Moreover, in the context of virtualization, there's now exactly one address space (since 
Arm Secure and Tag memory spaces are not required or supported except by emulation; I 
assume the same is true for x86 smm), and the aforementioned kerfuffle goes away.  There's 
no difference between global and per-cpu address spaces.

Anyway, it seems like this provides the same flexibility in the complex heterogeneous case 
and simplifies things for the homogeneous virtualization case.

Thoughts?
