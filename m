firmware.json can use BlockdevDriver, but we could question
whether it /should/ use BlockdevDriver. Is there really a
compelling reason to support every possible block driver for
readonly firmware and tiny nvram file ? I thin kit would be
totally reasonable to define a "FirmwareFormat" enum which
only permitted 'raw' and 'qcow2'.   If someone wants to
justify why we need another format, I'm all ears...

For SysEmuTarget its a little more useful, as in theory the
firmware could be extended to any QEMU target. In practice
thus far we've only used it todescribe EFI based firmware,
which is relevant for a subset of targets. It doesn't seem
to be a huge downside to define a FirmwareTarget enum with
only the arches we've actually got a use for so far. When
someone comes along with a need for non-EFI we can extend
it, and we'll need to extend libvirt at the same time anyway

IMHO copy the enum. While the risk exists, I don't think it is a
risk worth worrying about in reality. If someone points out a gap
that's important is a matter of minutes to patch it.
