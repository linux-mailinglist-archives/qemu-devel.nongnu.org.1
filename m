This is based on Peter's suggestion here[1].

I simply addrressed the occurrences that I found with `git grep "ARM "`
in the docs/ directory.  I didn't touch stuff like these "StrongARM",
ARM926EJ-S, ARM1176JZS, etc.  Related commit[2].

[1] https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2025-01/msg05137.html
    - docs/cpu-features: Update "PAuth" (Pointer Authentication) details
