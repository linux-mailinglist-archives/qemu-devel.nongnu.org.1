Ok.

Yes, or a SEV-ES guest.

I believe Daniel has answered this in his reply.

nit: TDX guest, or SEV-SNP with Secure TSC.

KVM uses the host default if tsc-frequency is not explicitly specified.

From the commit log:
  Attempts to set TSC frequency on both the SEV_SNP object and the cpu
  object result in an error from KVM (on the vCPU ioctl), so do not add
  separate checks for the same.

If the same frequency is specified in both places, then no error is 
thrown.
