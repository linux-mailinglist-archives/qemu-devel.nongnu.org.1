Yes, exactly.

Yes, using a BH would be safe, provided you put the BH in the right
loop, given that we have choice of the main event loop, or a non-default
GMainContext, or the special  AioContext that NBD is relying on.

That would likely make the scenario less error-prone, compared to
remembering to use a BH to synchronize.

Yeah, I believe we're probably safe in todays usage. My concern was
primarily about any surprises in the conceptual design that might
impact us in future.

I guess if NBD is the only thing using AioContext for QIONetListener
today, we could hoist the ref/unref only when using a AioContext,
and keep the GDestroyNotify usage for the GMainContext code path
to significantly limit the exposure. Avoid needing to do anything
extra for AioHandlers right before release.

With regards,
Daniel
