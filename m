Yes, migration is state-ful from that regard.  IMHO it is still ok because
unlike most jobs, migration task cannot have more than one.

Reusing jobs interface may work, but migation existed for so long a time
with its own APIs, I am not sure we'll get real benefit by reusing them.
At the meantime it may not 100% map to what migration wants (e.g.,
migrate_start_postcopy, postcopy recoveries, etc.).

OTOH, we definitely don't want to use the internal impl of jobs, because we
don't want to add either AIO or more coroutines into migration core - we
need to still use coroutine on dest QEMU but that's mostly only because of
legacy reasons.. and besides that and some very corner use case
(e.g. channel setups), migration is almost thread-based now.  A mixture of
threads and coroutines is too error prone and undebuggable, IMHO.

Going back to the "allow migrate QMP command take caps / parameters", we
still try to do that at some point.  But I recall we discussed about this
offlist (between Dan, probably Peter Krempa and myself), I believe the
conclusion is it'll make the API cleaner, but without no real benefit yet
so far.  Meanwhile there're some parameters that must be still stateful,
like a few max*-bandwidth or downtime_limit parameters.  They need to be
able to be changed on the fly, especially during migration task running.

Thanks,
