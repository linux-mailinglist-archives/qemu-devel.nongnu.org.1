What's the problem with versioning the virt machine though?

I'm thinking that in the future we would want to switch from PLIC to
AIA; change the memory map; or change the default extensions (maybe to
a profile). All of those would require a versioned virt machine.

I was thinking about doing this now, so we have a base for a few
releases. So when we do need a change we are ready to go
