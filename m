To be clear: this is pretty much a deal-breaker for me.

We established above that you need certain boolean properties to take a
third state.  I'm willing to discuss patches that change exactly these
properties.  I'm going to reject patches that affect properties that do
not need such a change.

Nothing stops you from creating qdev properties with a special "absent"
value.  All you need is a special value that cannot be set.

In fact, the humble "str" property already works that way: it's a char *
where null means "absent".

Code can recognize "absent" and do whatever needs doing then.  For
instance, consider device "ide-cd".  It has three such properties:
"ver", "serial", and "model".  "ver" defaults to "2.5+", "serial" to
some unique string, but "model" defaults to NULL.  Since you cannot set
such a value, it effectively means "absent".  The code responsible for
this is in ide_dev_initfn():

    if (!dev->version) {
        dev->version = g_strdup(s->version);
    }
    if (!dev->serial) {
        dev->serial = g_strdup(s->drive_serial_str);
    }

Note it leaves a null dev->model null.

Then make the code make "absent" mean what you need it to mean.  Just
like the code from ide_dev_initfn() I quoted above.

Unbreaking it will be a good chunk of work and complexity, I believe.
