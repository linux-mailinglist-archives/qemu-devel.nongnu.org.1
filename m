Yes, this could be some future work if it turns out to be a serious

Yes, I agree.

Sure.

Well, it turns out that Oracle has been coding a PoC for VFIO parallel 
migration over the multifd framework.

It looks promising, so I will drop my efforts in the current approach, 
giving the lead to Maciej from Oracle (CCed him here) who coded this 
PoC. AFAIK, he is currently working on an initial series based on his 
PoC and he will post it when ready. I think in the meanwhile it would be 
good to CC him in other multifd work that could be related to VFIO 
parallel migration.

Thanks!
