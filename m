Happens on x86 and s390 regularly enough, so we can't remove it.

This would definitely break SMC.

However, there's a better solution.  We're already iterating over all of the TBs on the 
current page only.  Move *everything* except the tb_phys_invalidate__locked call into the 
SMC ifdef, and unconditionally invalidate every TB selected in the loop.

We experimented with something like this for aarch64, which used to spend a lot of the 
kernel startup time invalidating code pages from the (somewhat bloated) EDK2 bios.  But it 
turned out the bigger problem was address space randomization, and with CF_PCREL the 
problem appeared to go away.

I don't think we've done any kvm-under-tcg performance testing, but lockup messages would 
certainly be something to look for...
