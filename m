v7: Thanks to Phillipe and Markus for reviews.
 QAPI docs were as Markus pointed out far too terse.
 So most of the changes in this series are making those more
 specific.
 Incorporated moving from Physical Address (as per the CXL specification)
 to the more meaningful DPA + clarifying comment that other things are
 found in the low bits. Hopefully that is a good trade off.

Based on:
[PATCH v7 0/4] hw/cxl: Poison get, inject, clear

Based on: Message-ID: 20230522145029.6370-1-Jonathan.Cameron@huawei.com

Updated cover letter from earlier versions:

One challenge here is striking the right balance between lots of constraints
in the injection code to enforce particular reserved bits etc by breaking
out all the flags as individual parameters vs having a reasonably concise
API.  I think this set strikes the right balance but others may well
disagree :)   Note that Ira raised the question of whether we should be
automatically establishing the volatile flag based on the Device Physical
Address of the injected error. My proposal is to not do so for now, but
to possibly revisit tightening the checking of injected errors in future.
Whilst the volatile flag is straight forwards, some of the other flags that
could be automatically set (or perhaps checked for validiaty) are much more
complex. Adding verification at this stage would greatly increase the
complexity of the patch + we are missing other elements that would interact
with this.  I'm not concerned about potential breaking of backwards compatibility
if it only related to the injection of errors that make no sense for a real
device.

CXL Event records inform the OS of various CXL device events.  Thus far CXL
memory devices are emulated and therefore don't naturally generate events.

Add an event infrastructure and mock event injection.  Previous versions
included a bulk insertion of lots of events.  However, this series focuses on
providing the ability to inject individual events through QMP.  Only the
General Media Event is included in this series as an example.  Other events can
be added pretty easily once the infrastructure is acceptable.

In addition, this version updates the code to be in line with the
specification based on discussions around the kernel patches.
