IMHO we should not even be using an Error object for the the blocker.
AFAICT, internally all we care about is the formatted string. The main
reason for using an Error object appears to be to have a convenient
pointer to use as an identifier to later pass to del_blocker.

I'd be inclined to just have passed in a fixed string, and return an
integer identifier for the blocker. eg

    int64 migrate_add_blocker(const char *reason, Error **errp);

    void migrate_del_blocker(int64 blockerid);

The migrate_add_blocker method would strdup(reason) to keep its own
copy.

The usage would thus be clear & simple:

    int64 blockerid = migrate_add_blocker("cannot migrate vfio", errp);
    if (!blockerid) {
         return;
    }

    ... some time later...

    migrate_del_blocker(blockerid);


In some cases we needed dynamically formatted strings, which could have
been achieved thus:

    g_autofree char *msg = g_strdup_printf("cannot migrate vfio %d", blah);
    int64 blockerid = migrate_add_blocker(msg, errp);
    ...the rest as above...

yes, this costs an extra strdup(), but that is an acceptable & negligible
overhead in the context in which we're doing this.

With regards,
Daniel
