Do you think we can achieve similar goal by simply turning the feature to
ON only after a few QEMU releases?  I also mentioned that idea below.

https://lore.kernel.org/r/ZqQNKZ9_OPhDq2AK@x1n

So far it really sounds like the right thing to do to me to fix all similar
issues, even without introducing anything new we need to maintain.

To put that again, what we need to do is this:

  - To start: we should NEVER turn any guest ABI relevant bits
    automatically by QEMU, for sure..

  - When introducing any new device feature that may both (1) affects guest
    ABI, and (2) depends on host kernel features, we set those default
    values to OFF always at start. So this already covers old machine
    types, no compat property needed so far.

  - We always fail hard on QEMU boot whenever we detected such property is
    not supported by the current host when with ON (and since it's OFF by
    default it must be that the user specified that ON).

  - When after a stablized period of time for that new feature to land most
    kernels (we may consider to look at how major Linux distros updates the
    kernel versions) when we're pretty sure the new feature should be
    available on most of the QEMU modern users, we add a patch to make the
    property default ON on the new machine type, add a compat property for
    old machines.

The last bullet also means we'll start to fail new machine type from
booting when running that very new QEMU on a very old kernel, but that's
the trade-off, and when doing it right on "stablizing the feature in the
kernel world", it should really be corner case.  The user should simply
invoke an old machine type on that old kernel, even if the qemu is new.

Thanks,
