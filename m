The concept of -platform will certainly reduce the number of tunables, 
but I'm a bit worried that such platform definitions can still have too 
much variety.

The variety of kernel is one; a downstream distro can have 
linux-rhel-9.5 or something as you suggested, but it is still a chore. 
Some features like eBPF may need privilege. Others may depend on 
hardware features.

I think it is simpler to analyze the platform dependency and dump it for 
the management layer. For example, libvirt can request QEMU to analyze 
the platform dependency when it creates a new domain. QEMU will then 
figure out that the host kernel is capable of USO and bake it as a 
platform dependency.
