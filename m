The quirks related to BAR4 access are generally for the vBIOS, we
wouldn't expect guest OS level drivers to use them.  IIRC this is
handling moving the stolen memory from the HPA to the GPA when the
vBIOS is writing the GTT.

Maybe that brings up an interesting topic.  Traditionally "legacy mode"
IGD assignment has been only for 440fx machines with SeaBIOS and last I
was aware edk2 wasn't willing to accept the same hack for the BDSM as
we had put into SeaBIOS, instead indicating that it should be
implemented in the device ROM.  Your branch in [1] above seems to
indicate edk2 does now have assigned IGD specific code.

Are these patches developing full stack support of these new devices,
from BIOS hand-off, through pre-boot environments, and through to guest
OS drivers, or are we only concerned that the guest OS level driver
lights up a display?

If you're using q35 and OVMF then you must be operating in the realm of
the mythical "Universal Pass-through" mode that I thought Intel had
abandoned.  It seems like we need an update to docs/igd-assign.txt as
it's likely very out of date based on recent improvements here and by
Corvin.

Also, are you proposing the noted edk2 change upstream?  It seems like
edk2 would need some sort of device version detection to know whether
to use a 32 or 64-bit BDSM value.  Thanks,

Alex
