This is a design mistake spreading.

What EDK2 maintainers want is one Read-Only + Exec region for CODE and
one Read-Write + NoExec region for VARS.

QEMU never implemented correctly pflash bank (multiple sectors) write
protected.

When EDK2 (x86, OVMF) was tried on QEMU, QEMU was using a single pflash.
To separate CODE/VARS, a second pflash was added, the first one being
"locked" into Read-Only mode. Using a pflash allowed the firmware to
identify device size using pflash CFI commands.

Then this design was copied to the ARM virt board for EDK2 needs.

In retrospective, this design was declared a mistake, since a simple
ROM region for the CODE is sufficient, and much simpler [*].

Thankfully the Loongarch64 virt machine started cleanly avoiding the
previous design flaw. It provides a ROM for CODE and pflash for VARS.

Unfortunately the riscv virt machine copied the x86/arm virt machines.


[*] Having 2 distinct pflash is useful for non-virt machines where the
     firmware might want to (re)program the CODE region, in the "capsule
     update" scenario. This scenario is irrelevant for virt machines,
     since a guest will never update its CODE. CODE is updated by the
     host.
