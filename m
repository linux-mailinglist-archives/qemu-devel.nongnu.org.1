Thanks for your answer Peter, it makes more clear for me what is the 
rationale between sorting the devices this way. It seems the root issue 
is the lack of proper interfacing between target cpu, and devices 
relying on it.

I don't expect any silver bullet to solve this, but we still need to 
move forward, so I'll share some options below.

This maybe explains why QEMU is a bit messy regarding its build system 
architecture, because people are not interested into it. IMHO it's a 
mistake, because a clean build system architecture will usually force a 
clean software architecture, at least in terms of components and 
interfacing. This is what we see right now, with some of the fixes from 
the single binary being to extract proper API with fixed types, that 
allow components to communicate in a proper way.
Complexity does not help neither, because it makes meson build files 
hard to understand, and probably push back a lot of people from looking 
at this. It's sad considering meson first objective is precisely to 
limit the complexity of build systems.

Regarding the "modern" completion support, I recommend you take a look 
at it. Even though you wrote or reviewed most of the code you navigate 
in everyday, and thus don't need it, it has become a standard tool for 
any developer, like sanitizers or omniscient debugging. It's especially 
interesting since those tools are based on compilers (clangd is the 
standard for C/C++ nowadays) and not a bunch of clunky regexps.
It's even more interesting when you learn a new language, like Rust.

Coming back to our issue, I can see two ways to solve it in a short term:
- On build system: define target hw before generic ones, so we can reuse 
all the source sets defined there. This has the advantage to be usable 
by all others architectures.
- Move gic related fields to a substructure in arm cpu, and provide a 
simple accessor to it, like "cpu_gicv3(cpu)", breaking the dependency to 
cpu.h. Concerned fields would be: gic_num_lrs, gic_vpribits, 
gic_vprebits, gic_pribits.

As you'll be the one having the final word and merging this, which 
option would you prefer to see?
