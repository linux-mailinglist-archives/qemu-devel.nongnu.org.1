Hi Paolo,

Please reply with review comments underneath individual patches, this
is hard to follow and I might miss some points.

I will send them on a separate series and merge them from my tree when revi=

These are independent from CI; i.e. you can merge your CI patches after tho=

Post your review under the patches please,

This patch moves the callbacks scope from public to inside the
function, no functional change related. It doesn't change or have
anything to do with chardev interfaces

I'm guessing you did not see the patch messages, which cover these
points. Post your review under the patches please,

A bindgen type is definitely preferred but for a Rust idiomatic
interface a wrapper type is a UX improvement (`CPU_LOG_PCALL`?
`LOG_GUEST_ERROR`? We can use friendlier symbols in the LogMask
variants for that)
