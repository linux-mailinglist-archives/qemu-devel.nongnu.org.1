Sorry, I am a little confused here. I was referring to QEMU's vhost-user
implementation here.

Based on what I have understood, "vhost_vring_addr" is only being used
for split vqs in QEMU's vhost-user and in other places too. The implementat=
ion
does not take into account packed vqs.

I was going through DPDK's source. In DPDK's implementation of vhost-user [=
1],
the same struct (vhost_virtqueue) is being used for split vqs and packed vq=
s. This
is possible since "vhost_virtqueue" [2] uses a union to wrap around the spl=
it and
packed versions of the vq.

I was referring to something similar by this. The current "vhost_vring_addr"
can be renamed to "vhost_vring_addr_split" for example, and a new struct
"vhost_vring_addr" can wrap around this and "vhost_vring_addr_packed"
using a union.

I liked the idea of using three unions for each member in the virtqueue for=
mat
instead of having one union for the whole format. I didn't think of this. I=
 think
by having three unions the "vhost_svq_get_vring_addr" [3] function won't ha=
ve
to be split into two new functions to handle split and packed formats separ=
ately.
I am not sure if this is what you were referring to.

Thanks,
Sahil
