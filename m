I agree, if we're moving away from non-blocking sessions, then we should
remove the switching everywhere.

But obviously...

...just making it blocking is not acceptable. It will potentially make
the guest hang while we're waiting for sftp responses.

I see that there is an sftp_aio_*() API, but it looks weird. Instead of
allowing you to just poll the next request that is ready, you have to
call a (blocking) wait on a specific request.

co_yield(), which is currently used when sftp_read() returns SSH_AGAIN,
makes sure that we poll the socket fd, so we can know that _something_
new has arrived. However it's unclear to me how to know _which_ request
received a reply and can be completed now. It seems you have to call
sftp_aio_wait_*() in non-blocking mode on all requests to do that, which
probably is affected by the libssh bug, too.

So I'm not sure if sftp_aio_*() can be combined with something else into
a working solution, and I also don't know if it's affected by the same
libssh bug.

Jakub, can you help with that?

Telling people to switch away from QEMU is not an appropriate fix for
the problem.

QEMU has all of the infrastructure with thread pools etc., that's not a
unique thing of nbdkit. So if libssh can't provide working non-blocking
connections, we'll have to use blocking sftp_read() in a worker thread.
It's uglier than using a proper asynchronous interface, but we'll have
to work with whatever we get from the library.

As far as I can see, libssh sessions aren't thread safe, so we'll have
to make sure to have only one request going at the same time, but I
assume that calling ssh_read/write() from different threads sequentially
isn't a problem?

I'm not sure if this is actually related to blocking sockets
specifically. It seems to me that it's more about blocking behaviour in
libssh itself, while it internally uses poll() to avoid blocking.
