I guess we have different defintions of "for humans" in this context.
I consider QMP  data still relevant for humans, because humans are
reviewing patches to libvirt that add usage of QMP features, or
triaging bug reports that include examples of usage, and in both
cases it is pretty relevant to make unstable features stand out to
the human via the x- prefix IMHO.
