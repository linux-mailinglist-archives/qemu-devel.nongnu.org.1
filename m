Hello Paolo, thank you for the thorough response,

To expand on this, I tried really hard to make the rust code live along 
the c files, but given that the bindings depend on various headers that 
are only gathered in the common source set in meson by the time all the 
subdirs are evaluated, it results in the Rust device being dependendant 
on a meson target (bindings_rs) that cannot be declared yet.

It's kind of a code smell, ideally we should not use bindgen for QEMU 
internal headers but update bindings along with the C headers (with 
extra tests to ensure definitions and layout match). Not for this 
patchset, but something to keep in mind.

I agree. I personally prefer using meson wraps and fetch the 
dependencies via network to be honest. While also providing Cargo.toml 
and Cargo.lock manifests for developers.

After working with the latest meson releases, it seems we will soon have 
a good enough way of handling all this with meson. It makes me sceptical 
of adding cargo wrappers and using a build system out of meson when we 
might be able to drop all that soonish. We might as well bite the bullet 
now to avoid working on something we know we will remove. It's not that 
of a clear-cut decision, so I'd like feedback on this. What do you 
think?

Thanks, this helps a lot.

Do you mean like Rust's safety comments?

https://std-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/policy/safety-comments.html

These can be required by lints which is really helpful. At this point 
the UART library has safety comments (which needs to be reviewed for 
validity). I plan on adding some at the macros in qemu-api as well.

>
>❌ a trait to store the CStr corresponding to the structs

I don't know yet if that is helpful in our usecase, because the strings 
must be visible from C, thus be (rust, not c) statics, unmangled and 
marked as #[used] for the linker. It makes sense from the Rust POV but 
must also be FFI-accessible.

>
>❌ a trait to generate all-zero structs without having to type "unsafe { 
>MaybeUninit::zeroed().assume_init() }"

Traits cannot have const fns at the moment (traits cannot have 
type-level effects like const or async but it's WIP to get them into 
rustc), so this cannot be used for statics and consts.

>
>❌ I'd like to use ctor instead of non-portable linker magic,

The linker sections are pretty much standard and in fact ctor uses the 
same linker attributes. Would writing our own constructor macro be a
solution for you? My reasoning is that 1) we support our own specific 
platforms and it's better for portability to reflect that in our source 
tree and 2) it avoids the external dependency, linker sections do not 
change so any ctor update would be in the API or adding more platform 
support,  not fixes in what we target.

>and the cstr crate instead of CStr statics or c""

Oh yes, the c"" literals must be replaced. The cstr! macro is the same, 
semantically, can you explain what you mean by "CStr statics"?

Ah forgot to mention it in the cover letter, everything is under the 
rust-pl011-rfc-v5 tag here:

This is my preference as stated above, if everyone also agrees.

Hmmm thanks for mentioning that, I did not notice any slow times 
locally. Will check.

Thanks!
