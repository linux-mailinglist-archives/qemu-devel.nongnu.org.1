>
> All memory that is mapped by the guest is preserved in place.  Indeed,

> quiesced during cpr-transfer.  All such memory must be mmap'able in new QEMU.

> shared, because they are visible in the file system in both old and new QEMU.
> Anonymous memory must be allocated using memfd_create rather than MAP_ANON,
> so the memfd's can be sent to new QEMU.  Pages that were locked in memory
> for DMA in old QEMU remain locked in new QEMU, because the descriptor of
> the device that locked them remains open.

> CPR state cannot be sent over the normal migration channel, because devices
> and backends are created prior to reading the channel, so this mode sends
> CPR state over a second "cpr" migration channel.  New QEMU reads the second
> channel prior to creating devices or backends.
