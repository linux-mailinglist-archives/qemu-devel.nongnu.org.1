-drive is built pretty much on the assumption that you have an image
format that runs on top of a protocol. Format probing probes the image
format, not the protocol, while prefixes like fat: (or nbd:, http: etc.)
specify the protocol.

So if you don't specify the format, we first open the protocol level
(which is vvfat) and then probing will detect that over this protocol,
we access a raw image. So it's mostly like saying format=raw.

I think that format=<protocol driver> works is really more accidental,
but we can't change it now (and probably also don't want to). It results
in opening only the protocol layer and not stacking any format driver on
top of it.

Options that you specify in -drive generally go to the top layer. So the
consequence in our case is that with format=vvfat, the option goes to
vvfat, but with format=raw (or unspecified format), it goes to the raw
forma driver.

It's fine, and I might use the same one myself (though you should be
aware that fat:rw: is risky, it's full of bugs).

But if you add an option like size=64M, it goes to the raw driver, which
will take whatever image you access on the protocol level and truncate
it at 64 MiB.

If you want to give the size option on the vvfat level (and create a
filesystem that is actually only 64 MiB instead of truncating a larger
one), then obviously format=vvfat allows you to do that because then
there is no raw format layer to begin with. Or if you do have the raw
format layer, you can access options of the protocol layer by prefixing
"file.". So format=raw,file.size=64M would still pass the size option to
vvfat.

So the command line does allow you to get the option to the right place,
it's just very easy to get confused about this and to specify the option
for the wrong layer.

All of those are honestly fine, too, if you're happy with the defaults
and don't want to set more advanced options.

I'll give you this bonus option if you want to be modern:

    -blockdev vvfat,node-name=ufat,dir=/my_directory,rw=on
    -device usb-storage,drive=ufat

But I don't think any of the other options is going away anytime soon.
