While I understand where the LLVM maintainers are coming from, IMHO
their proposed policy leaves alot to be desired. 80% of the material
in the policy has nothing to do with AI content. Rather it is stating
the general contribution norms that the project expects to be followed
regardless of what tools may have been used.

I think perhaps alot of the contributions norms are previously informal
and learnt on the job as you gradually acclimatize to participation in
a specific project, or first learning about open source in general.

This reliance on informal norms was always somewhat of a problem, but
it is being supercharged by AI. It is now much more likely to see project
interactions from less experienced people, who are relying on AI tools
to provide a quick on-ramp to the project, bypassing the more gradual
learning experience.


As an example of why the distinction between AI policy and general
contribution policy matters, consider the great many bugs / security
reports we've had based off the output of static analysis tools.

Almost none of this was related to AI, but the people submitting
them often failed on basic expectations such as sanity checking
what the tool claimed, or understanding what they were reporting,
or understanding why they're changing the code they way they did.

If we don't already have our "contribution norms" sufficiently
clearly documented, we should improve that independently of any
AI related policy.  The AI related section in our docs should
merely refer the reader over to our other contribution policies
for anything that isn't directly related to AI.


We do have a gap wrt to bug reporting where I think we should document
an expectation that any use of automated tools in the bug report must
be diclosed, whether those tools are AI or not. This should apply to
any static analysis tool.

With regards,
Daniel
