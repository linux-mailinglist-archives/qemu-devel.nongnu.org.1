I'm assuming here that you are opposing the "by module" categorization
specifically.

Fair enough. Markus has said similar things; that the split by module is
more of a sin of necessity than a genuine categorization. I suppose in my
mind's eye it is my hope that they WOULD be useful for grouping like
commands, structures, and events by topic. I admit they are not necessarily
strictly adherent to that idea at the moment.

However, I think it's *conceptually* useful to group together, say, "block
related things" into a block topic. Modules may not fit this 1:1 at
current, but it's the best we have.

If there's opposition to doing it in this manner, I cede, but still
maintain that grouping things by topic would be superior to a flat list of
just absolutely everything.

Keep in mind that once the "inliner" is merged, the great majority of
"internal" structures will be omitted from this index. The exact definition
of what is elided is hard for me to describe formally, but: Any object that
is currently referenced only via "...The members of ..." will be omitted,
as the information relating to that definition will be inlined into the
appropriate command/event instead.

This will also by definition exclude entities that aren't referenced at
all, such as internal definitions we use for QOM/QDEV and similar purposes.

Due to a limitation in how I present alternates (i.e. via reference to the
type and not by inlining the choices/types), alternates are one of the few
types whose internal details remain even after the inliner is merged. This
isn't a fundamental barrier, just where the cutting room knife made the
excision, and can be remedied in the future.

The algorithm for what is visible is something like the following:

1. All entities are hidden by default.
2. All commands and events are marked visible.
3. All member types belonging to a visible entity (commands, events) are
marked as visible; i.e. if an event uses an enum or a command takes a
compound object as an argument, those entities become visible in the
documentation, even though the name of that type is an "internal detail".
This is because I do not have a system in place for presenting recursive
structures, and it is currently easiest to link to these types by
reference, necessitating their visibility. This marking is carried out
recursively.
4. All return types, currently, are marked visible. In the future we may
inline return structures in a manner similar to members, but we do not do
so, yet.

This isn't enough to remove *all* internal types, but it does get a lion's
share of them and thins the documentation considerably. I don't have
numbers on hand at present, but when I get these prerequisite series out of
the way, I can enumerate them.

Yes; but that's how indices are at times: multiple things are listed in
multiple places to facilitate lookup. It is not really meant to be space
efficient.

In my case, the things I really truly care about are:

(1) A true alphabetical list of all symbols we have documented, and
(2) A list of all events and commands, specifically.

Everything else more or less just comes along for the ride by parallel;
making an index for events/commands inherently creates an index for
objects, enums, etc. I didn't see a need to specifically exclude them.

That'd be cool! Unfortunately I'm going to reply here with the dreaded
"patches welcome". I'm worried I don't have the mandate to spend much more
time on this project than I already have... :(

If you'd like to take a crack at it, I would be happy to advise.

Maybe! This patchset is one of those cases where I went to fix one thing
and got carried away... If I can extract just this fix by its lonesome I
will do so. I admit that I forget right now how easy that is to do, or if
it relies on my restructuring of other elements.

... It's probably easy enough to rewrite, anyway.

I suppose so. If we do not find the master index useful, we could go the
other route and eliminate it entirely, leaving only the domain-specific
indices. I recall Markus at one point assumed the master index to work as
this patch makes it work, so I just closed the loop here. The way it
currently actually works is that the master index only indexes items that
have no associated domain, which turns out to be essentially nothing.

This looks a bit wierd having the same types and modules repeated<br>
multiple times.<br></blockquote><div><br></div><div>I suppose so. If we do =
not find the master index useful, we could go the other route and eliminate=
 it entirely, leaving only the domain-specific indices. I recall Markus at =
one point assumed the master index to work as this patch makes it work, so =
I just closed the loop here. The way it currently actually works is that th=
e master index only indexes items that have no associated domain, which tur=
ns out to be essentially nothing.</div><div>=C2=A0</div><blockquote class=
