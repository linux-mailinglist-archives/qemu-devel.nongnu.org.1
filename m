I haven't given up on this yet, that's why I alternatively proposed

object_alloc (same as object_new without object_initialize)
memory_region_init

which is just a small change but should also work without adding 
memory_region_new convenience functions. Then only object_alloc needs to 
be added.

What I don't like is that it blows up the object state and makes it look 
more complex than needed. Memory regions are often created at realize then 
never used again. The documentation also says that these should be managed 
automatically and when memory_region_init'ing it adds a reference to the 
owner that should be enough to manage the lifetime of the mr. Also when 
using sysbus_init_mmio it also stores a pointer to the mr so actually no 
need to store those MemoryRegions in the object state for SysBusDevices. 
Then most simple devices could do without a subclass or only a few fields 
in their state that they add to their superclass but now we have these 
full of these memory regions unnecessarily.

But this makes the device more difficult to comprehend. As in the raven 
device above we had a lot of memory regions plus an unneeded init method 
that we could do without to make the device simpler and easier to 
understand what actual functionality it adds. Having additional fields in 
the state struct just distracts from that.

It looks like we won't be able to come to an agreement before the freeze 
and I don't have time now to change this patch but don't want to miss the 
release with this series that finishes pegasos renaming because of this. 
So for this patch I'd say since this is already how it is now and it does 
not make it worse and this object is not user creatable anyway so cannot 
leak please take it as it is and we'll do a clean up later after we finish 
discussion.
