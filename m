The scope of the policy is around contributions we receive as
patches with SoB. Researching / brainstorming / analysis etc
are not contribution activities, so not covered by the policy
IMHO.

Documentation we maintain has the same concerns as code.
So I'd suggest to substitute 'code' with 'code / content'.

IMHO its redundant, as the policy is expressly around contribution of
code/content, and those activities as not contribution related, so
outside the scope already.
