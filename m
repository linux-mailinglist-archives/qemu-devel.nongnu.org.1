Fair enough.

Let's then still try to see whether we can brainstorm something that can
still at least avoid the "let's clear a remote pointer in a finalize(),
because it looks safe" approach.. I'm not sure if I'm the only one that
feels nervous with it.

Fundamentally, if you can remotely clear a pointer, it means it's not used
at all. In practise, that's correct because as I also discussed before I
don't think RCU readers use flatview->root at all.  It was almost only
because we have some very light references on flatview->root.  The major
"hidden" reference is actually the key in flat_views hash, however I don't
think it will have any stale root MR VA as key, as long as after a proper
commit() completes.

In short, I want to discuss with you on whether we can completely remove
the flatview->root reference, instead of resetting it in finalize().

Since that'll need to be justified, I prepared some sample patches myself.
It survives all my smoke tests.  Once again, please treat them as comments
only.  Would you think that's slightly better?  Attached at the end.

IMHO removing view->root makes sure nothing will surprise us in the future
v.s. remote resets.

Thanks,

Subject: [PATCH 1/3] memory: Remove flatview root reference in
 mtree_print_dispatch()

This is so far only used to dump an extra "[ROOT]" tag when the termination
MR is the root MR.  This is so far the only real necessary reference to
flatview's root.  Remove it.  We lose this tag, but the hope is with the
MR's name still being available it's still clear on what it represents.

This paves way for a complete removal of root MR reference on flatviews.

One other reason to reference a Flatview's root MR is to fetch a name.
Remember that inside Flatview itself so as to drop this reference to
Flatview's root MR.

Subject: [PATCH 3/3] memory: Remove Flatview->root reference completely

memory.rst has this paragraph, which is currently inaccurate:

  This exceptional usage is valid because aliases and containers only help
  QEMU building the guest's memory map; they are never accessed directly.
  memory_region_ref and memory_region_unref are never called on aliases or
  containers, and the above situation then cannot happen.  Exploiting this
  exception is rarely necessary, and therefore it is discouraged, but
  nevertheless it is used in a few places.

It was inaccurate because flatviews so far can take a refcount on an alias
MR, which may cause an object_unparent() on top of alias MR unsafe too.

However, Flatview logically doesn't need to take refcount on its root MR
that was used to generate the topology.

When generating the topology, the root MR is used within the whole process.
Said that, it doesn't need the refcount because it keeps holding BQL
without releasing, so the root MR cannot have chance to be detached or
freed.

There's another very implicit use of the root MR, which is as the index of
the flat_views hash.  However that is fine too without refcount, because
for each memory whole transaction, it will guarantee that after memory
region commit()ed and returned, the flat_views hash will not have any key
that points to an invalid root MR.  It's because the role is the MR needs
to be fully detached first before object_unparent(), then it guarantees it
won't appear in any of the Flatviews.
