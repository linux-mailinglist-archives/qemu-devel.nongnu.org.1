Just because the IRQ update is needed in many places and the chardev
backend only in one place.

Yeah, if I was writing from scratch I would probably call update()
unconditionally. If it turns out to be inefficient you could cache the
current value of

        let flags =3D regs.int_level & regs.int_enabled;

in PL011State as a BqlCell.

Ideally nothing, especially considering that more modern devices have
edge-triggered interrupts like MSIs, instead of level-triggered
interrupts that need qemu_set_irq() calls. But if you have something a
lot more complex than a bool I would pass down the PL011State and do
something like pl011.schedule_update_irq() which updates a BqlCell<>.
The device could then use a bottom half or process them after
"drop(regs)".

HPET has another approach, which is to store a backpointer from
HPETTimer to the HPETState, so that it can do

    self.get_state().irqs[route].pulse();

without passing down anything. The reason for this is that it has
multiple timers on the same routine, and it assigns the timers to
separate HPETTimers. I would not use it for PL011 because all accesses
to the PL011Registers go through the PL011State.

A while ago I checked how OpenVMM does it, and basically it does not
have the PL011State/PL011Registers separation at all: the devices are
automatically wrapped with a Mutex and memory accesses take a &mut.
That removes some of the complexity, but also a lot of flexibility.

Unfortunately, before being able to reason on how to make peace with
the limitations of safe Rust, it was necessary to spend a lot of time
writing API abstractions, otherwise you don't actually experience the
limitations. But that means that the number of lines of code in
qemu_api is not representative of my experience using it. :( I am
sorry this isn't a great answer yet; certainly some aspects of the
PL011 or HPET devices could be treated as a blueprint for future
devices, but which and how to document that is something where I would
like to consult with an actual Rust maven.
