So far, only bdrv_co_write_req_prepare() seems to have a problem. All
other asserts are due to the process of activation/inactivation itself.

I can only assume that paths checking the flag and doing some operation
based on it are still going to work as expected.

@Andrey, do you want to send a patch with the migration fix? I can work
on the block layer stuff.
