+Nested PAPR API (aka KVM on PowerVM)
+====================================
+
+This API aims at providing support to enable nested virtualization with
+KVM on PowerVM. While the existing support for nested KVM on PowerNV was
+introduced with cap-nested-hv option, however, with a slight design change,
+to enable this on papr/pseries, a new cap-nested-papr option is added. eg:
+
+  qemu-system-ppc64 -cpu POWER10 -machine pseries,cap-nested-papr=true ...

+
+Below taken from the kernel documentation:
+
+Introduction
+============
+
+This document explains how a guest operating system can act as a
+hypervisor and run nested guests through the use of hypercalls, if the
+hypervisor has implemented them. The terms L0, L1, and L2 are used to
+refer to different software entities. L0 is the hypervisor mode entity
+that would normally be called the "host" or "hypervisor". L1 is a
+guest virtual machine that is directly run under L0 and is initiated
+and controlled by L0. L2 is a guest virtual machine that is initiated
+and controlled by L1 acting as a hypervisor. A significant design change
+wrt existing API is that now the entire L2 state is maintained within L0.
+
+Existing Nested-HV API
+======================
+
+Linux/KVM has had support for Nesting as an L0 or L1 since 2018
+
+The L0 code was added::
+
+   commit 8e3f5fc1045dc49fd175b978c5457f5f51e7a2ce
+   Author: Paul Mackerras <paulus@ozlabs.org>
+   Date:   Mon Oct 8 16:31:03 2018 +1100
+   KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Framework and hcall stubs for nested virtualization
+
+The L1 code was added::
+
+   commit 360cae313702cdd0b90f82c261a8302fecef030a
+   Author: Paul Mackerras <paulus@ozlabs.org>
+   Date:   Mon Oct 8 16:31:04 2018 +1100
+   KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Nested guest entry via hypercall
+
+This API works primarily using a signal hcall h_enter_nested(). This
+call made by the L1 to tell the L0 to start an L2 vCPU with the given
+state. The L0 then starts this L2 and runs until an L2 exit condition
+is reached. Once the L2 exits, the state of the L2 is given back to
+the L1 by the L0. The full L2 vCPU state is always transferred from
+and to L1 when the L2 is run. The L0 doesn't keep any state on the L2
+vCPU (except in the short sequence in the L0 on L1 -> L2 entry and L2
+-> L1 exit).
+
+The only state kept by the L0 is the partition table. The L1 registers
+it's partition table using the h_set_partition_table() hcall. All
+other state held by the L0 about the L2s is cached state (such as
+shadow page tables).
+
+The L1 may run any L2 or vCPU without first informing the L0. It
+simply starts the vCPU using h_enter_nested(). The creation of L2s and
+vCPUs is done implicitly whenever h_enter_nested() is called.
+
+In this document, we call this existing API the v1 API.
+
+New PAPR API
+===============
+
+The new PAPR API changes from the v1 API such that the creating L2 and
+associated vCPUs is explicit. In this document, we call this the v2
+API.
+
+h_enter_nested() is replaced with H_GUEST_VCPU_RUN().  Before this can
+be called the L1 must explicitly create the L2 using h_guest_create()
+and any associated vCPUs() created with h_guest_create_vCPU(). Getting
+and setting vCPU state can also be performed using h_guest_{g|s}et
+hcall.
+
+The basic execution flow is for an L1 to create an L2, run it, and
+delete it is:
+
+- L1 and L0 negotiate capabilities with H_GUEST_{G,S}ET_CAPABILITIES()
+  (normally at L1 boot time).
+
+- L1 requests the L0 to create an L2 with H_GUEST_CREATE() and receives a token
+
+- L1 requests the L0 to create an L2 vCPU with H_GUEST_CREATE_VCPU()
+
+- L1 and L0 communicate the vCPU state using the H_GUEST_{G,S}ET() hcall
+
+- L1 requests the L0 to run the vCPU using H_GUEST_RUN_VCPU() hcall
+
+- L1 deletes L2 with H_GUEST_DELETE()
+
+More details of the individual hcalls follows:
+
+HCALL Details
+=============
+
+This documentation is provided to give an overall understating of the
+API. It doesn't aim to provide full details required to implement
+an L1 or L0. Latest PAPR spec shall be referred for more details.
+
+All these HCALLs are made by the L1 to the L0.
+
+H_GUEST_GET_CAPABILITIES()
+--------------------------
+
+This is called to get the capabilities of the L0 nested
+hypervisor. This includes capabilities such the CPU versions (eg
+POWER9, POWER10) that are supported as L2s.
+
+H_GUEST_SET_CAPABILITIES()
+--------------------------
+
+This is called to inform the L0 of the capabilities of the L1
+hypervisor. The set of flags passed here are the same as
+H_GUEST_GET_CAPABILITIES()
+
+Typically, GET will be called first and then SET will be called with a
+subset of the flags returned from GET. This process allows the L0 and
+L1 to negotiate a agreed set of capabilities.
+
+H_GUEST_CREATE()
+----------------
+
+This is called to create a L2. Returned is ID of the L2 created
+(similar to an LPID), which can be use on subsequent HCALLs to
+identify the L2.
+
+H_GUEST_CREATE_VCPU()
+---------------------
+
+This is called to create a vCPU associated with a L2. The L2 id
+(returned from H_GUEST_CREATE()) should be passed it. Also passed in
+is a unique (for this L2) vCPUid. This vCPUid is allocated by the
+L1.
+
+H_GUEST_SET_STATE()
+-------------------
+
+This is called to set L2 wide or vCPU specific L2 state. This info is
+passed via the Guest State Buffer (GSB), details below.
+
+This can set either L2 wide or vcpu specific information. Examples of
+L2 wide is the timebase offset or process scoped page table
+info. Examples of vCPU wide are GPRs or VSRs. A bit in the flags
+parameter specifies if this call is L2 wide or vCPU specific and the
+IDs in the GSB must match this.
+
+The L1 provides a pointer to the GSB as a parameter to this call. Also
+provided is the L2 and vCPU IDs associated with the state to set.
+
+The L1 writes all values in the GSB and the L0 only reads the GSB for
+this call
+
+H_GUEST_GET_STATE()
+-------------------
+
+This is called to get state associated with a L2 or L2 vCPU. This info
+passed via the GSB (details below).
+
+This can get either L2 wide or vcpu specific information. Examples of
+L2 wide is the timebase offset or process scoped page table
+info. Examples of vCPU wide are GPRs or VSRs. A bit in the flags
+parameter specifies if this call is L2 wide or vCPU specific and the
+IDs in the GSB must match this.
+
+The L1 provides a pointer to the GSB as a parameter to this call. Also
+provided is the L2 and vCPU IDs associated with the state to get.
+
+The L1 writes only the IDs and sizes in the GSB.  L0 writes the
+associated values for each ID in the GSB.
+
+H_GUEST_RUN_VCPU()
+------------------
+
+This is called to run an L2 vCPU. The L2 and vCPU IDs are passed in as
+parameters. The vCPU runs with the state set previously using
+H_GUEST_SET_STATE(). When the L2 exits, the L1 will resume from this
+hcall.
+
+This hcall also has associated input and output GSBs. Unlike
+H_GUEST_{S,G}ET_STATE(), these GSB pointers are not passed in as
+parameters to the hcall (This was done in the interest of
+performance). The locations of these GSBs must be preregistered using
+the H_GUEST_SET_STATE() call with ID 0x0c00 and 0x0c01 (see table later
+below).
+
+The input GSB may contain only VCPU wide elements to be set. This GSB
+may also contain zero elements (ie 0 in the first 4 bytes of the GSB)
+if nothing needs to be set.
+
+On exit from the hcall, the output buffer is filled with elements
+determined by the L0. The reason for the exit is contained in GPR4 (ie
+NIP is put in GPR4).  The elements returned depend on the exit
+type. For example, if the exit reason is the L2 doing a hcall (GPR4 =
+0xc00), then GPR3-12 are provided in the output GSB as this is the
+state likely needed to service the hcall. If additional state is
+needed, H_GUEST_GET_STATE() may be called by the L1.
+
+To synthesize interrupts in the L2, when calling H_GUEST_RUN_VCPU()
+the L1 may set a flag (as a hcall parameter) and the L0 will
+synthesize the interrupt in the L2. Alternatively, the L1 may
+synthesize the interrupt itself using H_GUEST_SET_STATE() or the
+H_GUEST_RUN_VCPU() input GSB to set the state appropriately.
+
+H_GUEST_DELETE()
+----------------
+
+This is called to delete an L2. All associated vCPUs are also
+deleted. No specific vCPU delete call is provided.
+
+A flag may be provided to delete all guests. This is used to reset the
+L0 in the case of kdump/kexec.
+
+Guest State Buffer (GSB)
+========================
+
+The Guest State Buffer (GSB) is the main method of communicating state
+about the L2 between the L1 and L0 via H_GUEST_{G,S}ET() and
+H_GUEST_VCPU_RUN() calls.
+
+State may be associated with a whole L2 (eg timebase offset) or a
+specific L2 vCPU (eg. GPR state). Only L2 VCPU state maybe be set by
+H_GUEST_VCPU_RUN().
+
+All data in the GSB is big endian (as is standard in PAPR)
+
+The Guest state buffer has a header which gives the number of
+elements, followed by the GSB elements themselves.
+

+Miscellaneous info
+==================
+
+State not in ptregs/hvregs
+--------------------------
+
+In the v1 API, some state is not in the ptregs/hvstate. This includes
+the vector register and some SPRs. For the L1 to set this state for
+the L2, the L1 loads up these hardware registers before the
+h_enter_nested() call and the L0 ensures they end up as the L2 state
+(by not touching them).
+
+The v2 API removes this and explicitly sets this state via the GSB.
+
+L1 Implementation details: Caching state
+----------------------------------------
+
+In the v1 API, all state is sent from the L1 to the L0 and vice versa
+on every h_enter_nested() hcall. If the L0 is not currently running
+any L2s, the L0 has no state information about them. The only
+exception to this is the location of the partition table, registered
+via h_set_partition_table().
+
+The v2 API changes this so that the L0 retains the L2 state even when
+it's vCPUs are no longer running. This means that the L1 only needs to
+communicate with the L0 about L2 state when it needs to modify the L2
+state, or when it's value is out of date. This provides an opportunity
+for performance optimisation.
+
+When a vCPU exits from a H_GUEST_RUN_VCPU() call, the L1 internally
+marks all L2 state as invalid. This means that if the L1 wants to know
+the L2 state (say via a kvm_get_one_reg() call), it needs  to call
+H_GUEST_GET_STATE() to get that state. Once it's read, it's marked as
+valid in L1 until the L2 is run again.
+
+Also, when an L1 modifies L2 vcpu state, it doesn't need to write it
+to the L0 until that L2 vcpu runs again. Hence when the L1 updates
+state (say via a kvm_set_one_reg() call), it writes to an internal L1
+copy and only flushes this copy to the L0 when the L2 runs again via
+the H_GUEST_VCPU_RUN() input buffer.
+
+This lazy updating of state by the L1 avoids unnecessary
+H_GUEST_{G|S}ET_STATE() calls.
