Oh, that was extremely subtle.

Pre-patch, zero_target is set to false while sync == SYNC_TOP prior to
calling blockdev.c:blockdev_mirror_common().  But in that function, we
were forcefully slamming sync to MIRROR_SYNC_MODE_FULL if
bdrv_backing_chain_next(bs) == NULL.  Once zero_target is no longer
available, that means any mirror job using "sync":"top" but with no
backing image (which is effectively syncing the entire chain) now
defaults to pre-zeroing - and since 185 intentionally throttles
things, the newly-triggered pre-zeroing takes so long that the test
times out.

Fortunately, an examination of all places in mirror.c that care about
sync_mode TOP vs FULL shows that prior to this series, they were
mostly treated identically everywhere (only zero_target mattered)
thanks to the is_none_mode bool.  The lone exception was in
mirror_start, with this statement:

    base = mode == MIRROR_SYNC_MODE_TOP ? bdrv_backing_chain_next(bs) : NULL;

but we know that the caller slammed mode to MODE_FULL precisely if it
used to be TOP and bdrv_backing_chain_next(bs) == NULL.  So if the
caller doesn't slam sync to FULL, this ternary still sets base to the
same value.  And we are back to skipping the pre-zeroing pass for
"sync":"top", the way test 185 wants.

Hence, I'm squashing this in, and preparing the pull request.
