True.  I was pretending modules don't exist until later in the message.

Modules broke object_new(), but I'd rather not call object_new()'s
design bad for not accomodating a feature tacked on half-baked almost a
decade later.  But let's discuss modules further down.

Asserting preconditions isn't the problem; this is how preconditions
*should* be checked.  The problem is error-prone preconditions.

Using string type names is in theory error-prone: the compiler cannot
check the type name is valid.  It could be invalid because of a typo, or
because it names a type that's not linked into this binary.

The compiler could check with an enumeration, but then the header
defining needed to be included basically everywhere QOM is used, and
changed all the time.

So QOM went with strings.  I can't remember "invalid type name" bugs
surviving even basic testing in more than a decade of QOM use.

Except for *user-supplied* type names.  These need to be validated, we
failed to factor out common validation code, and ended up with bugs in
some of the copies.

Has this been a problem in practice?  We have thirteen years of

The first problem could perhaps be hand-waved away: must deploy all
modules or else.  But that partly defeats the purpose of modules, namely
keeping unwanted dependencies off the host.

The second problem cannot: assertion failure on otherwise survivable
resource shortage is unequivocally wrong.

For more on module trouble, see "Problem 3: Loadable modules" in my memo
"Dynamic & heterogeneous machines, initial configuration: problems"[*]

We'd have to rely on the test suite here, as we've done for "type name
is valid".

I can offer two ideas.

I'll start with devices for reasons that will become apparent in a
minute.

The first idea is straighforward in conception: since the problem is
modules breaking existing design assumptions, unbreak them.

Device creation cannot fail, only realize can.  Could we delay the
problematic failure modes introduced by modules from creation to
realize?

When creating the real thing fails, create a dummy instead.  Of course,
the dummy needs to be sufficiently functional to provide for the things
we do with devices before realize, such as introspection.

Note that we already link information on modules into the binary, so
that the binary knows which modules provide a certain object.  To enable
sufficiently functional dummies, we'd have to link more.

The difficulty is "the things we do with devices before realize": do we
even know?

The other difficulty is that objects don't have realize.  User-creatable
objects have complete, which is kind of similar.  See also "Problem 5:
QOM lacks a clear life cycle" in my memo "Dynamic & heterogeneous
machines, initial configuration: problems"[*].

The second idea is a variation of your idea to provide two interfaces
for object creation, where using the wrong one won't compile: a common
one that cannot fail, i.e. object_new(), and an uncommon one that can.
Let's call that one object_try_new() for now.

Your proposed "string literal" as a useful approximation of "cannot
fail".  Modules defeat that.

What if we switch from strings to something more expressive?

Step one: replace string type names by symbols

Change

    #define TYPE_FOO "foo"

    Object *object_new(const char *typename);

to something like

    extern const TypeInfoSafe foo_info;
    #define TYPE_FOO &foo_info

    Object *object_new(const TypeInfoSafe *type_info);

Step two: different symbols for safe and unsafe types

    extern const TypeInfoUnsafe bar_info;
    #define TYPE_BAR &bar_info
=20=20=20=20
    Object *object_try_new(const TypeInfoUnsafe *type_info);

Now you cannot pass bar_info to object_new().

For a module-enabled TYPE_BAR, we already have something like

    module_obj(TYPE_BAR)

Make macro module_obj() require its argument to be TypeInfoUnsafe.

Voil=C3=A0, the compiler enforces use of object_try_new() for objects
provided by loadable modules.

There will be some fallout around computed type names such as
ACCEL_OPS_NAME().  Fairly rare, I think.

More fallout around passing TYPE_ macros to functions that accept both
safe and unsafe types.  How common is that?

Worth exploring?
