I agree with the perception, however I can't determine what "init" means
in this scenario. It's not clear from the original change at exactly
which point we're safe to assume fds have been consumed from some
subsystem (block probably). This also clashes with the (new) usage we're
attempting here for migration because the migration code would almost
certainly only consume the fds after this point.

They stay around until after the reconnection. Then either get removed
via qmp_remove_fd() or when a subsystem dups them and eventually calls
qemu_close().

The initial assumption seems to have been overly conservative, there
will always be a monitor connection around, even if it disconnects
briefly.

Per Daniel's suggestion we're considering a management layer bug if it
passes fds that QEMU never needs to consume. So QEMU will not attempt
any cleanup of perceived unused fds since they could be needed at a
later point (e.g. after qmp_migrate).
