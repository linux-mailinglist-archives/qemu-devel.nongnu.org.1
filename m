Yeah, I see your point and I agree on a better solution.

I didn't get this point :-( can you elaborate?

I completely agree on this!

Yes, this was a problem we introduced with F_SEQPACKET. Unfortunately, 
when we added that feature, we didn't define F_STREAM well because the 
devices always supported it. So we had to resort to this workaround.

Yep, is this, but I have in my todo to fix this somehow.
