These flips are actually a problem. When using live-migration with disk
mirroring, it's good that an actively synced image stays actively
synced. Otherwise, migration could finish at an inconvenient time and
try to inactivate the block device while mirror still got something to
do which would lead to an assertion failure [0].

The IO test added by this series is what uses the possibility to sync to
"diff images" which contain only the delta. In production, we are only
syncing to a previously mirrored target image. Non-aligned writes are
not an issue later like with a diff image. (Even if the initial
mirroring happened via ZFS replication outside of QEMU).

So copy-mode=write-blocking would work fine for our use case, but if I
go with the "mark clusters for unaligned writes dirty"-approach, it
would not work fine anymore.

Should I rather just document the limitation for the combination "target
is a diff image" and copy-mode=write-blocking?

I'd still add the check for the granularity and target cluster size.
While also only needed for diff images, it would allow using background
mode safely for those.

Fiona
