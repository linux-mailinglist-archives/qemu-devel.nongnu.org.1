If not exposed it may be used for internal properties (where simpler solutions aren't convenient) but maybe qdev also adds easier definition of properties that's why they used instead of QOM properties?

Only properties that are implementation details should not be exposed because setting them can break the device. There are a few places where we have such properties. But you say "in places" so I think you meant the same.

Building machines declaratively has been the dream for many years.

I chose to write "might be in places", because I can't point to examples
offhand to support a stronger claim :)

External interfaces should be intentional, i.e. carefully curated to
serve actual use cases.  They should also be stable and documented.

The QOM parts of our external interfaces are largely accidental,
unstable, and undocumented.  We have some internal need, we create
something to serve it, and expose it externally simply because we lack
the means not to.

It might have some uses and maybe that's the reason why people would like these to go through deprecation instead of just dropping them. Marking some properties not exposed would get the same resistance then so may not solve the issue.

If you need to mess with properties to make migration work, that's a
bug.  That's versioning machinery's job.

External interfaces just for testing can be okay.  We should not promise
stability there.  We should still be intentional, and we should still
document.

Attempts to get rid of external interfaces always draw resistance, even
when they're accidental.
