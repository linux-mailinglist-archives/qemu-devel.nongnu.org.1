I was thinking whether cpr-transfer can be enabled by default, so whenever
people want to use it, no code reset needed.  It's also easier for Libvirt
to not need to add yet another machine flags if possible.

Currently this parameter is the only one left that needs to be manually
enabled on src.  It means if we can get rid of it then any QEMU based VM on
Linux can do a cpr-transfer any time as long as QEMU supports it.

Without it, this new parameter will need to be manually enabled otherwise
another system code reboot / live migration needs to happen first without
CPR, just to enable this flag.

But yeah I don't think I think it all through, so I left my pure question.
I think it looks still like an option, the other option if we still want to
enable it by default is, keep the option, then only enable it on new
machines that is based on Linux.

OS dependency is definitely an issue.  AFAICT CPR is only available for
Linux anyway, but I'm happy to be corrected..  IOW, those chunk of new code
(if only unconditionally done..) would need proper #ifdef, so that
non-Linux OSes work like before.

So yeah, I hoped the memory commit won't be a problem, because I think they
should be corner case MRs, and should be small.

Vram can take up to 16MB, that's the max I'm aware of, but indeed I don't
know all the use cases to be sure.  I think it means some tens of MBs can
be accounted later during fault rather than upfront to fail QEMU from boot.
Ideally mgmt apps should leave enough space for these ones, but if we worry
on that we can stick with the current option (but create a new flag besides
RAM_SHARED).

I was thinking KSM was for merging OS/App pages (rather than BIOSs, which
are normally very, very small)?  Though I could be wrong.

We don't need to make it a bigger discussion.  If there's concern with it,
we can stick with a new flag.

The next question is whether if with a new flag we should enable it by
default sometimes (e.g. on new machine types on Linux).  But when with a
new option, that can be discussed later.
