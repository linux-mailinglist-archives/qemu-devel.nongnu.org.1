Right, but there's an extra memcpy to do that. Not sure how those
balance out.

We also don't flush the iov at once, so f->buf seems redundant to
me. But of course, if we touch any of that we must ensure we're not
dropping any major optimization.

Any piece of code that fills an iov with data is prone to be able to
send that data through multifd. From this perspective, multifd is just a
way to give work to an iochannel. We don't *need* to use it, but it
might be simple enough to the point that the benefit of ditching
QEMUFile can be reached without too much rework.

Say we provision multifd threads early and leave them waiting for any
part of the migration code to send some data. We could have n-1 threads
idle waiting for the bulk of the data and use a single thread for any
early traffic that does not need to be parallel.

I'm not suggesting we do any of this right away or even that this is the
correct way to go, I'm just letting you know some of my ideas and why I
think ram + device state might not be the only data we put through
multifd.

Well it depends on what the alternative is. If we're going to create a
thread to send small chunks of data anyway, we could use the multifd
threads instead.

Just to be clear, do you want a thread-pool to replace multifd? Or would
that be only used for concurrency on the producer side?

It would be good if we could standardize on a single structure for data
transfer. Today it's kind of a mess, QEMUFile with it's several data
sizes, iovs, MultiFDPages_t, whatever comes out of this series in
p->data, etc. That makes it difficult to change the underlying model
without rewriting a bunch of logic.

No concern, it's just that you didn't mention any of this when you
suggested the union, so I thought you simply ignored it.

"holding of the client data" is what we're discussing here: The fact
that multifd keeps multifd_send_state->pages around for the next call to
multifd_queue_pages() to reach.

Anyway, your M+N suggestion seems to be enough to address this, let's
see.
