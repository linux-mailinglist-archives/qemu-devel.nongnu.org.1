The "gotcha" is that the memory system's implementation of the
size 1 and 2 reads when .impl.min is 4 and .valid.min is 1
(as for instance with aspeed_apb2opb_ops after this patch)
is "read 4 bytes, return the relevant portion"
and the implementation of size 1 and 2 writes is "pad the
small value with zeroes at either end appropriately so it is
4 bytes and write that". That is often the right thing for
the required behaviour of the device registers, but it is
also quite common that it is the wrong behaviour. For instance
for some devices the write of a byte is supposed to only modify
that byte, and leave the other bytes of a 4-byte register alone.
Or if the device has bit-clears-on-read behaviour for a register
then the default handling will incorrectly do that for bits
that the guest didn't actually read.

Conversely if the device leaves the .impl.min at its default 1
and moves .valid.min from 4 to 1 (as with eg ftgmac100_ops)
the device will now be called for byte reads and writes at any
address in its range. If a write to, say, byte 3 of a 32-bit
register is supposed to update bits [31:24], that won't happen
unless the write function is changed (usually if there's a switch
on offset the write to something that's not at a multiple-of-4
will end up in the default "log an error" code path).

What this adds up to is that it's a bit misleading to have
a single patch which changes the minimum access size for lots
of devices at once, because for each device you need to look
at QEMU's implementation of the read and write functions
together with the spec of the device, and confirm that the
right way to implement "byte writes are supported" for this
particular device is to change .valid.min, and that you don't
also need to make changes to the read or write function code
at the same time or adjust .impl.min. Putting them all in one
patch with no discussion in the commit message of the device
behaviour and implementation was just a bit of a yellow flag
to me that maybe this complexity wasn't considered.

If we get this wrong for one of these devices, it's also likely
to be rather easier to bisect the problem if bisection
can track it down to "we made this change to aspeed_timer"
rather than "we made this change to a dozen devices all at once".
