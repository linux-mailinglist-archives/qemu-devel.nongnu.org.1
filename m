I think we need firstly aligned on what the behavior of the Windows that 
hit "unsupported processor" is.

My understanding is, the Windows is doing something like

	if (is_AMD && CPUID(arch_capabilities))
		error(unsupported processor)

And I think this behavior is not correct.

However, it seems not the behavior of the Windows from your 
understanding. So what's the behavior in you mind?

If we are agreed it's the bug of Windows, then no fix in QEMU/KVM at all.

work fine on real hardware but have issue with virtualization doesn't 
mean it is the problem of virtualization unless we figure out the 
root-cause and prove that software/OS's behavior is correct.

If the problem is due to the wrong behavior of guest OS, then it has 
nothing to do QEMU/KVM and QEMU/KVM cannot avoid such problem.
