Note that I did not mark bdrv_drain_all_begin() as GRAPH_UNLOCKED in the
series yet. The reason is that I wasn't fully sure if that is okay,
given that it also can be called from a coroutine and does
bdrv_co_yield_to_drain() then. But I suppose that doesn't do anything
with the graph lock, so I'll add the GRAPH_UNLOCKED marker in v3.

I don't see any callers that actually are in coroutine context, except
test_quiesce_co_drain_all() and test_drv_cb_co_drain_all() in
tests/unit/test-bdrv-drain.c

Adding
 GLOBAL_STATE_CODE();
 assert(!qemu_in_coroutine());
to the beginning of the function seems to not cause any test failures
except for the two unit tests already mentioned.

Best Regards,
Fiona
