Yeah, it considers it to be improper OO - it remembers only the
broadest type from the base class, which is Optional[T]. We aren't
overriding the property itself, we've just redefined a different
initializer, which doesn't carry through to the actual object.

(i.e. the initializer takes a T, the core object has an Optional[T],
there's no problem - but the field remains Optional[T].)
