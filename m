I think the assertion and comments are overkill. Doesn't having a nested 
GHashTable save some words you have to wrote for the assumption?

I'm also not quite convinced that the comments and assertions are enough 
to say this hack is safe; what if some sort of pointer authentication is 
added and shuffles bits? Will this hack be compatible with static and 
dynamic checkers we may have in the future?
