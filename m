I think in a complex heterogenous machine you do want the
monitor NMI command to do something sensible, but the
definition of "sensible" is going to be machine-specific:
probably it will be "raise NMI in some way on some core in
the main application processor cluster", and it's the machine
model that's going to know what "sensible" is for that machine.

The current hw/core/nmi.c code is a bit odd because it's partly
working with a cpu_index and partly not: the code passes cpu_index
around, but in practice for the QMP command the user can't set
which CPU to operate on, and for everything except s390 the
implementation doesn't care anyway. My impression from the IRC
discussion is that it's not really necessary for the S390 that
the monitor user be able to specify which CPU to NMI (and in any
case you can only do that from the HMP command, not the QMP
command, AIUI), so getting rid of that weird inconsistency makes
sense to me: and that's what this patchset is doing.

What NMI probably ought to be is board-specific: so it's like
having some notional front panel switch labeled "NMI", and the
board gets to decide what that means (which is usually going to be
"send some NMI like interrupt to the first CPU in the main cluster",
but could be something else). It doesn't need to be like a
front panel switch with a rotary-selector for 'pick a CPU'
plus a button for "send NMI to that CPU". In fact we're quite
close to "it's a board thing" already, because almost every
implementation of the TYPE_NMI interface is actually a machine
model. (The exceptions are hw/intc/m68k_irqc.c,
hw/m68k/q800-glue.c and hw/misc/macio/gpio.c.)

So I think that:
 * we should indeed drop the cpu_index stuff, per this patch:
   it's unnecessary cruft we don't really use
 * we should look at whether the three classes listed above
   which implement TYPE_NMI on a non-machine-model are really
   the right way to do that, i.e. whether it would be a lot of
   effort to effectively switch to having nmi_monitor_handler
   be a simple method on MachineClass. Not walking the QOM
   tree would make the NMI infrastructure rather simpler.
   (But I just looked at the macio case, and it's inside a
   PCI device, so at best that's a bunch of clunky plumbing.)
 * failing that, we should look at whether we should really
   continue to walk the whole QOM tree calling methods on every
   TYPE_NMI object, or whether we can say "once we've found one
   implementation we're done". This also depends on those three
   non-MachineClass implementations, because obviously there's
   only ever one MachineClass object in the system. This is
   kind of useful for heterogenous boards which use the m68k
   or ppc devices listed above (seems highly unlikely), but it
   would mean you can override the default "those objects handle
   NMI" by having your heterogenous board implement TYPE_NMI,
   and then since it's earlier in the QOM tree that will be
   the method called, not the ones on specific devices.
   (This one I think we can easily do -- my quick check suggests
   that TYPE_M68K_IRQ is only used in the m68k virt board,
   TYPE_GLUE is only used in the m68k q800 board, and
   TYPE_MACIO_GPIO is only used in the ppc mac99 board. So in
   fact in all cases there's only ever one TYPE_NMI interface
   present in the system.)

The last two aren't blockers for heterogenous-system work,
though: they just seem to me like nice cleanup of this interface.

thanks
