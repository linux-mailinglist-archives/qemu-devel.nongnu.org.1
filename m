Thanks for the answers.  I think I'll need to read more into the patches in
the next few days; it looks like I'll get more answers from there.

I just sent an email probably when you're drafting this one.. it may has
some questions that may not be covered here.

I think a major issue with exec() is the (1-3) steps that I mentioned there
that needs to run sequentially, and IIUC all these steps can be completely
avoided in cpr-transfer, and it may matter a lot in huge VMs.  But maybe I
missed something.

Please have a look there.
