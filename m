I agree that the locks makes more sense in a threading model like it was
the case in v2. At this point it doesn't make much sense to have both
BQL and manual locks.

For context, we moved away from it back in v2, after this comment from
Frank Chang:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-riscv/CANzO1D35eYan8axod37tAg88r=qg4Jt0CVTvO+0AiwRLbbV64A@mail.gmail.com/

--------------
In our experience, using QEMU thread increases the latency of command
queue processing,
which leads to the potential IOMMU fence timeout in the Linux driver
when using IOMMU with KVM,
e.g. booting the guest Linux.

Is it possible to remove the thread from the IOMMU just like ARM, AMD,
and Intel IOMMU models?
--------------

Frank then elaborated further about IOFENCE and how they were hitting asserts
that were solved after moving the IOMMU away from a thread model.

For now I removed all locks, like Peter suggested, and in my testing with
riscv-iommu-pci and riscv-iommu-sys I didn't see anything bad happening.
BQL is granting enough race protection it seems.

I believe we should stick with this approach, instead of rolling back
to a threading model that Frank said back in v2 that could be problematic.
Nothing is stopping us from moving back to a threading model later if we
start hitting race conditions or even if we have performance improvements
in doing so. At that point we'll be more versed in how the IOMMU is going
to be used by everyone else too.


Thanks,

Daniel
