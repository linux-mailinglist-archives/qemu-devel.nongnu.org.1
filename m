Hello Peter,

* Above code returns 'true' for 'multifd' and 'main_channel' cases.
When migrate_postcopy_preempt() is true, main_channel is 'false', so
it returns false. All I have done is reused the
migration_should_start_incoming() function to simplify the 'if'
conditional at the top.

* Instead of adding specific conditions and splitting functions, my
request is, let's work towards consistent channel behaviour that will
automatically simplify these conditions and channel handling. Maybe we
can do that in a subsequent series.

* ie. Because I removed the mapped-ram check, so tls/file channels are
handled by multifd_recv_new_channel()? No, that's not the case.
Rather, that is how it works currently. I have not changed anything,
only made it more explicit to see that when it is tls/file channel,
handle it as a CH_MULTIFD type. Looking at the current code, one can
not see clearly how tls/file channels are handled.

* We are again using 'flush' and 'sync' interchangeably. What does -
flush only makes sure all threads are synced - mean really? Is it not
writing all socket data onto the wire/channel?

* Flush should write all socket data onto the network wire/channel.
The _order_ in which threads flush/write their socket data onto the
wire/channel is to synchronise them, maintaining/controlling that
_order_ is not flush.

> It may not make sure the order of things to happen in multifd threads and postcopy thread.  The

* Let's see:
   1) When migration is in Postcopy mode, ram_save_multifd_page() is
_not_ called on the source side. ie. no multifd data gets enqueued on
the multifd queue.
       1.1) multifd_queue_page() function also calls multifd_send() if
the queue is full, before enqueueing new pages.
   2) If a multifd page reaches the destination during Postcopy mode,
it must have been sent/written on the multifd channel before Postcopy
mode started, right?
   3) In this case, writing/flushing all multifd socket data onto the
wire/channel, before calling postcopy_start() function should help
IIUC.
       3.1) ie. calling multifd_send() before postcopy_start() should
help to clear the multifd queue, before Postcopy begins.
       3.2) Same can be done by - multifd_ram_flush_and_sync() ->
multifd_send() - sequence.

* If all multifd pages are sent/written/flushed onto the multifd
channels before postcopy_start() is called, then multifd pages should
not arrive at the destination after postcopy starts IIUC.  If that is
happening, we need a reproducer for such a case. Do we have such a
reproducer?

> That's why I was requesting to add an assert() in multifd recv thread to

* ie. Add  assert(!migrate_in_postcopy())  in multifd_recv_thread()
function?  Okay.


Thank you.
