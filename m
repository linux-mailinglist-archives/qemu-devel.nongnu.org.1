Probably nowhere. More importantly, I don't think a compatibility
promise that says otherwise is documented either. And we know that
defaults have changed before, and that libvirt tries to be as explicit
as possible to avoid being impacted by changed defaults.

Do you disagree? If so, is there any way to change defaults or do we
have to stick to the existing defaults forever? To me not specifying an
option means "just pick anything that makes sense", without any promise
that this stays the same across versions.

Maybe? Though the kind of unstable I think of with vvfat is more than
just API instability that the QAPI feature is about. vvfat is more a
dirty (and clever) hack that sometimes works and can be useful enough,
but if it breaks, you get to keep both pieces. Good for one-off uses on
your personal toy VM, but keep it far away from production. We never
seriously tried to get it to a properly supportable level.

(And yes, probably none of this is documented as clearly as it should
be.)
