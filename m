The advantage of my patch is it does not require further knowledge 
beyond the two reference counters. Even now, if someone is going to 
change system/memory.c, they need to know there are two reference 
counters, and that is sufficient to understand my patch too. However, if 
we add some workaround specific to subregion, they will need to 
understand the specifics of subregion as well.

memory_region_finalize() is not a function to tell the owner is leaving, 
but the memory region itself is being destroyed. It should not happen 
when a container is still referencing it. That is also why it has 
memory_region_ref(subregion) in 
memory_region_update_container_subregions() and assert(!mr->container) 
in memory_region_finalize().

I really do not want owners to remove subregions manually. We should 
automate the finalization procedure as much as possible.

Let's keep the discussion away from the subtle details. The waste of 
cycles is virtually imperceptible in the slow path we are caring now.

You should take MR->refcount into the picture of memory_region_ref(). 
Otherwise you will not understand why memory regions get finalized 
during the finalization of the owner. The understanding of the timing is 
essential to understand why your patch is necessary too.

I have no idea to save people from the trouble of understanding the 
owner and memory region objects when dealing with references and 
finalization.
