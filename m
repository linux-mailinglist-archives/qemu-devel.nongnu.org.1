I was just trying OpenBSD/sparc64 with 8.2 recently and found hme(4) does
not work. I tried with the NE2k driver as I remember adding the driver=20
to the
OpenBSD kernel before an hme driver existed and it sort of worked, but th=
ere
were still issues.

I'll re-test with 9 now and see what happens.
