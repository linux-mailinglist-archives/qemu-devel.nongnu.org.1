Yep, there's a tradeoff, so we have to figure out what's practical

We should focus on doing what's optimal for platforms where
tests do work, since they're inherantly our most important
platforms. If we proactively fetch python deps for tests that
happen to be broken on a platform already, I'm not too fussed
about that, as long as we don't break things more than they
are already broken.

IIUC,  'pip' will have a local cache of downloads somewhere under
$HOME, so presumably when we install deps, we're only going to have
a download hit the very first time on a machine, or when the needed
versions change ? If we're mostly just copying files out of the
local cache, the time overhead should remain fairly minimal most of
the time.

We have precedent for downloading stuff at configure stage from
the Rust deps and git submodules. Those Rust deps are used for
built code rather than tests, but if we did need some rust deps
only for tests, presumably they'd still be done in configure ?

I'd we interested to know how much overhead loading the functional
test deps actually is ?

As a conceptual point beyond this series, I've always tended to expect
that a "configure" script (or equivalent) is responsible for validating
the host OS pre-requisites and/or fetching neede pre-requisites.

Anything after that (whether builds or tests) would then (mostly) work
from stuff that was already acquired by configure.

This lets devs see upfront if there are any problems with their host,
instead of the host problems being hit later where the errors are
mixed in with build logs.

With functional tests we of course don't want to download the assets
upfront as that's GB's of data. I would tend towards suggesting that
any python deps should be fetched upfront at the configure stage
though, unless we see an unacceptable time hit from that.

I sent that as a formal proposal here:

  https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2025-12/msg01351.html

For the functional test example illustrated there though, we would
preferrably want the functional test deps fetched upfront.

Note, this is not just about test deps. The qemu python code is used by
other misc QEMU developer tools, such as the qmp-shell command. I'm
considering the python deps as more like "QEMU build env pre-requisites",
which is what pushed me towards believeing they should be fetched by
default
