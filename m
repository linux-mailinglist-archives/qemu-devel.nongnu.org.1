Admittedly I'm not actively working on the QEMU Rust code, but to
me to feels the opposite - we've shown it is possible to write useful
Rust code with the older version baseline. It may not be the ideal
way we want the code to look, but that's a tradeoff we can make.

I very much worry that at any point in time there is *always* going
to be something in a newer Rust that is very attractive to use, so
we end up on a slippery slope where we're always going to be chasing
the latest version to get a better way.

We've had the same situation with Meson where we initially set a
temporary newer baseline to get some critical features we could
not do without, and now have ended up in a situation where we
are continually pushing newer & newer versions, because there is
always something attractive in the new release.

IMHO for Rust in QEMU we should be targetting both new features
and existing feature ports - excluding existing feature ports
would be tieing one of our hands behind our back limiting the
potential benefits we can see.

Yes, this increasing defeats the benefit of defining our distro
target. We wanted to set a clear baseline that we could unambiguously
target, to give clarity to both users & contributors on when we could/
would impose new version requirements. 

We've made exceptions for python, and then meson, and now Rust. We can
rationalize it is as "users only need to do x, y & z to get newer stuff",
but as we make more & more exceptions, this is a game of death by a 1000
cuts.

With regards,
Daniel
