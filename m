Change Log
==========

Patch V2 -> V3:
1. Addressed left over issues of x86 suggested by Igor Mammedov (Redhat):
   - Removed the `ACPICPUstatus::is_enabled` State as well as it was
     breaking the x86 migration
   - Above is in addition to `is_present` state which was removed in V2
   - Dropped [PATCH 1/6] of V2 patch-set 
   - Introduced hooks `CPUClass::cpu_{persistence,enabled}_status()`
2. Fixed the accidental CPUs AML break of x86 in V2 (sorry for this!).

Patch V1 -> V2:
1. Addressed Igor Mammedov's (Redhat) raised issues:
   - Removed `ACPICPUstatus::is_present` State and its handling in the
     ACPI APUs AML code and now all QOM vCPUs are present.
   - Dropped the concept of `acpi_persistent` because now QOM vCPUs
     states and the ACPI vCPU states are consistent.
   - QOM vCPU objects are always present now (accompanying RFC V6)
   - Added .needed() hook to the GED VMSD toconditionally migrate the
     ACPI CPU hotplug state at the source VM.
2. Addressed Zhao Liu's (Intel) reported x86 DSDT Table bios-acpi-test failure 
3. Incorporated Gustavo Romero's comments and added his Tag to [Patches 1,2,4]
4. Addressed Gavin Shan's comment to reduce the inline code comments
   wherever possible.


Brief Recall
============
With the advent of multi-core SoCs, the concept of CPU-level hotplugging
has become less distinct, often functioning as a power on/off event
rather than a full hotplug operation. However, hotplug support at the
die/NUMA/socket level remains meaningful and is architecture-specific.
Virtual CPU hotplug can be supported regardless of architectural support
for physical CPU hotplug, as it serves resource management needs—such as
dynamically scaling VM compute capacity based on demand or SLAs,
optimizing boot times, or reducing memory footprint. Although, its
desing must be scalable and must co-exist with future die/NUMA/socket
level hotplug features.


Motivation for this patch-set
=============================
In architectures that support vCPU hotplug, firmware or the VMM/QEMU
typically reflects vCPU status changes to the OS via the ACPI
`_STA.Present` bit. However, certain CPU architectures prohibit [1]
modifications to CPU presence after kernel boot. This restriction [2][3]
could be due to closely integrated per-CPU components—like interrupt
controllers or other features— that may not support reconfiguration
post-boot and are often in an `always-on` power domain. Consequently,
specifications for these architectures require all CPUs to remain
present i.e.`_STA.Present=True`, once the system is initialized.

To be able to support vCPU Hotplug feature, as a workaround to the above
limitation,  ACPI method `_STA.Enabled` Bit could be used to reflect the
plugged and unplugged states of the QOM vCPUs.

This patch set introduces the following changes:

1. Introduces`CPUClass::cpu_{persistence,enabled}_status` hooks: To
   check if the CPU should always remain present even after unplug
   operation and to fetch the vCPU `enabled` status in case it is
   present. Later is used in context when Guest Kernel evaluates
   ACPI `_STA` method and the status is read from the flags stored
   in the Qemu ACPI code.
   
2. Support for Migrating ACPI CPU Hotplug State: Facilitates the
   migration of the ACPI CPU hotplug state in VMSD by conditonally
   making it part of the GED VMSD.

3. Updates the Qtest bios-acpi-tables/DSDT binaries for x86/{pc,q35}

This patch set is designed to work independently and is meant to ensure
compatibility with existing hotplug support across different
architectures. This patch-set has been tested alongside ARM-specific
vCPU hotplug changes (included in the upcoming RFC V6 [4]), and
hot(un)plug functionalities performed as expected which concerns this
patch-set. Please have a look.

Thank you!
