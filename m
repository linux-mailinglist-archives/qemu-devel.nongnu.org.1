This sentence itself did not explain much, IMHO.  QEMU can share memory
using fd based memory already of all kinds, as long as the memory backend
is path-based it can be shared by sharing the same paths to dst.

This reads very confusing as a generic concept.  I mean, QEMU migration
relies on so many things to work right.  We mostly asks the users to "use
exactly the same cmdline for src/dst QEMU unless you know what you're
doing", otherwise many things can break.  That should also include ramblock
being matched between src/dst due to the same cmdlines provided on both
sides.  It'll be confusing to mention this when we thought the ramblocks
also rely on that fact.

So IIUC this sentence should be dropped in the real patch, and I'll try to
guess the real reason with below..

.. It could be about the vfio vaddr update feature that you mentioned and
only for iommufd (as IIUC vfio still relies on iova ranges, then it won't
help here)?

If so, IMHO we should have this patch (or any variance form) to be there
for your upcoming vfio support.  Keeping this around like this will make
the series harder to review.  Or is it needed even before VFIO?

Another thing to ask: does this idea also need to rely on some future
iommufd kernel support?  If there's anything that's not merged in current
Linux upstream, this series needs to be marked as RFC, so it's not target
for merging.  This will also be true if this patch is "preparing" for that
work.  It means if this patch only services iommufd purpose, even if it
doesn't require any kernel header to be referenced, we should only merge it
together with the full iommufd support comes later (and that'll be after
iommufd kernel supports land).

Thanks,
