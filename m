When I wrote my review comment, my mind was running on "mechanical
transformation" rails: "the faithful update would be".  The "in state 3"
predicate is .members is not None before the patch, and ._check_complete
afterwards.

You're right, the assertion no longer guards.  It can at best aid
understanding the code.  Feel free to drop it.

Would it make sense to explain the transformation of the "in state N"
predicates briefly in the commit message?

My observation is that this patch could be split in two, not that parts
of it belong to the previous patch.
