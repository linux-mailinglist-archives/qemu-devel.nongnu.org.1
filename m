Hello,

So far I've figured out that I need to add a member called SplitIRQ
in the BCMSocPeripheralBaseState struct, which is of size defined
by `BCM2835_NUM_SPLITTERS`. Then from what I can tell through
reading through the codebase, I should do something similar to
what happens in `exynos4210.c` in the `exynos4210_init_board_irqs`
function?

Sorry for taking a while to get back and still having quite a few
questions about this. Thank you for helping me out with writting
this patch.

Since otherwise it'd turn into a somewhat sizeable patch pretty quick, and is a lot of work, for something that's not *too* big of an issue. I do have access to a raspberry pi if you think I should do any kind of testing before doing the reshuffling.
