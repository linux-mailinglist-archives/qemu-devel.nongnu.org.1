Something I've not previously realized is that when run via GDB, we are
not honouring the Python version we chose to use with QEMU. GDB is not
actually running the python interpreter binary, instead it has linked to
the libpython.so and runs python code in-process to GDB. Thus the version
of python being used is out of our control, it is whatever the distro
chose to link GDB to. When I look back at how we've handled our min
python, vs what the distros use as system python, I think the constraint
is highly undesirable.

Right, this is one of the things I rather dislike with this, as it is
making debugging much more painful.

In one base.log you just get stdout from gdb with no context of what
commands are run, and in the other base.log you get the logs from the
sub-process. Well at least you would if we fixed the tests to use
self.log, instead of creating a new logger category.

Even with that fixed though, it is very difficult to correlate GDB
output in one log, with GDB commands invoke in the other log, in
order to understand why it is failing in the x86/ppc tests.

With regards,
Daniel
