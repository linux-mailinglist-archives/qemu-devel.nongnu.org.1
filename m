In terms of "why does it need to be user created" - the goal was to expose
multiple SMMUs to the guest, each associated with a separate physical SMMU.
IIUC, each physical NUMA node would have its own SMMU.

So configuring a guest VM will require creating multiple PXBs, one for
each virtual NUMA node, and then creating SMMUs for each PXB.

Since there was a need for the user to create SMMUs for the PXBs, the
question was then raised, why shouldn't the default SMMU also be
user creatable in the same way, so that mgmt apps like libvirt have
a single way to configure the SMMUs with -device.

With regards,
Daniel
