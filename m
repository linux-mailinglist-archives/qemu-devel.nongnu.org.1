We're emulating what U-Boot does. If it does not find a valid environment 
it will overwrite with defaults. These defaults are to get the same 
behaviour and additionally to enable UDMA for IDE driver that until now 
had to be done manually to get the same speed as with pegasos2 where this 
is enabled by default. (That's because these VIA VT82C686B chips had some 
issues with DMA even in PCs but the emulated devices work so can be 
enabled and that's faster on QEMU too.)

U-Boot has the defaults hard coded. I set and use it from the same file so 
I don't see the need to send this through a property. (Properties are also 
listed in QEMU Monitor with info qtree and I don't know how a long string 
with embedded zeros would look there so I don't think that's a good idea.)

> Anywhere to document this behaviour for users?

I've added docs in the cover letter that I hope would end up in the 
changelog and I have a separate page for this which I'll update at 
qmiga.codeberg.page (Haven't done that yet but would do it by the 
release once this is merged.)

The idea is to allow supplying an environment via the backing file or let 
users edit it and clear the checksum in which case it will take the 
supplied data and only fix the checksum. Unlike U-Boot it will only 
replace empty backing file with defaults. (This is kind of undocumented 
for advanced users only but that's why the above code looks like that.) 
Having an empty NVRAM does not make much sense as U-Boot always has some 
values there so it's never empty. If it finds empty NVRAM then installs 
default env which is to help new users so they only need to create an 
empty file to get started. It also works without backing file in which 
case we want to use defaults and keep it persistent only for the session.

I have the checksum check in separate if to warn if there is a checksum 
but it's wrong because I only want it to fix checksum if it's zero but not 
touch it otherwise. Basically it will only overwrite zero values but leave 
nonzero values there. (Might be useful for testing what does the guest do 
if the checksum is wrong, although on real machine U-Boot would have 
replaced the env with default in that case so this would only happen if 
the NVRAM is changed during runtime without updating the checksum.)
