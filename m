At a high level, yes, but I think that's actually a downside of
migration_is_running. It's not explicit.

E.g.: qmp_migrate -> migration_transport_compatible is the first time
capabilities are checked in the code. Guess what migration_is_running
returns at that point? (it's false)

If there's ever a change in BQL behavior, there'll be a bug and we'll
see another patch extending the scope of migration_is_running, either
adding existing states to it, or as Prasad proposed, adding a new state
that is set a little later/earlier.

What we technically want is to stop accepting new capabilities as soon
as we're about to use them for the first time. Not as soon as (state ==
ACTIVE || SETUP || ...) which is a more high level definition.

What about during migration_cleanup() or migrate-cancel? Won't there
ever be something in the path of setting these params that would require
a "healthy" migration?

Sure, I'd just like to avoid adding another set of "if
(s->parameters->has_foobar)" if possible.

It works. I think it's fragile due to:

- the reliance on BQL to avoid concurrent invocations;

- the possible addition of new states for unrelated reasons
  risks regressions and it's just extra work to make sure everything is
  still blocked at the time it needs to be blocked.

- any bugs need to be fixed by moving states around, which is dubious
  since the migration flow itself (which the states should represent)
  has not changed in a while.

  We're still seeing patches such as dc487044d5 ("migration: Make
  migration_has_failed() work even for CANCELLING") and the recent patch
  from Prasad. So there is something changing elsewhere and exposing
  these bugs and it's not immediately clear what that something is (or
  else we would have avoided the bug).

To be clear, I'm not asking we solve these issues at this moment, it's
fine if we go forward with the simple scheme. I'm just trying to clarify
what I think the problems are.

We're moving towards decoupling MigrationStatus from these ordinary code
checks. MigrationStatus should be used for informing management about a
relevant change in the migration stage of progression.

As it stands, we're either "exposing implementation details" or
"inadvertently changing the API". Both are undesirable.

Of course, we might introduce the "internal state is off-sync with
externally visible states" issue, but hopefully we'll catch that during
review. =)

No worries, I'm just collecting your opinions on it.
