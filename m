I wouldn't ask maintainers to fixup commits regularly, especially changing 
the patch itself would need resend from the author but for small typos in 
commit message only it might be OK to fix them up on commit if noticed 
before a pull. Just because if these aren't fixed they will be in git log 
forever.
