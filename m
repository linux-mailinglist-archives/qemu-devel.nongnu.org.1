Also not today.  SCNR!

So:

* At some point, we'll integrate whatever we want developers to run into
  "make check".  Until then:

* Running "make check-dev" is nice and good enough.  CI might find
  additional problems.  Expected to be rare and no big deal.

* Running "make check-minreqs" locally will get the exact same results
  as the same test in CI will.  Run if you care.

* "make check-tox" is an early warning system.  Don't run unless you're
  interested in preventing potential future problems.
