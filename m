Graceful TLS termination (via gnutls_bye()) should only be important to
security if the QEMU protocol in question does not know how much data it
is expecting to recieve. ie it cannot otherwise distinguish between an
expected EOF, and a premature EOF triggered by an attacker.

If the migration protocol has sufficient info to know when a chanel is
expected to see EOF, then we should stop trying to read from the TLS
channel before seeing the underlying EOF.

Ignoring GNUTLS_E_PREMATURE_TERMINATION would be valid if we know that
migration will still fail corretly in the case of a malicious attack
causing premature termination.

If there's a risk that migration may succeed, but with incomplete data,
then we would need the full gnutls_bye dance.

With regards,
Daniel
