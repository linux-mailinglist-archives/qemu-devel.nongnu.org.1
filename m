The ebe52b592d you reference, makes me think that the only reason for the
'is not running' was as a way to detect when init had finished; and there
are certainly better ways to do that (now?).

However, the efb87c1697 talks about cleaning up non-dup's on all monitors
closed, to stop getting left-over fd's that were added but then not used
(because a disconnect happened between adding and being used).
In your world when do these get cleaned up?
