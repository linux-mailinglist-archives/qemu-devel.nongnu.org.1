I learnt that FESCo approved a surprisingly loose rule saying

  "Libraries packaged in Fedora may require ISA extensions,
   however any packaged application must not crash on any
   officially supported architecture, either by providing
   a generic fallback implementation OR by cleanly exiting
   when the requisite hardware support is unavailable."

This might suggest we could put a runtime feature check in main(),
print a warning and then exit(1), however, QEMU has alot of code
that is triggered from ELF constructors. If we're building the
entire of QEMU codebase with extra features enabled, I worry that
the constructors could potentially cause a illegal instruction
crash before main() runs ?

With regards,
Daniel
