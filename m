To be clear up front: this is more of a tangential musing than anything
else, and I'm not making a concrete proposal wrt this patchset.

scripts/, like contrib/, is a bit of an odd directory structure from my
point of view. I don't think something happening to be a script
ought to affect where we put it in our source tree -- scripts/
is really more like "tooling used at build time and by developers".
If we had a user-facing utility that happened to be written in
python or in shell, that ought to go in tools/ I think, for instance.
To the extent that our standards are lower in scripts/ it should
be because we know that the audience and usage pattern for those
utilities is limited and so it's not necessarily worth the effort to
bring them up to the standards we'd apply to user-facing code.
(Similarly we're a bit sloppier in C code in tests/ than we are
in C code that goes into QEMU proper.)

IMHO half of contrib/ ought to be in tools/, and for contrib/
I'm particularly not a fan of having a bit of the directory tree
that's labelled as "put stuff here that we don't care about". Either
we care about it and it should go in the appropriate place in
the tree for what it is, or else we don't care about it and it
should live out-of-tree...
