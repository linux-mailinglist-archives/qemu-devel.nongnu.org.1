I'm not sure that's the case here.

32-on-32 is already effectively unmaintained, so we're not suffering
in terms of keeping the 32-on-32 code reliable.

We're suffering from the complexity that 32-on-32 code places on the
rest of the XX-on-64 code that we do care about.

IOW if someone volunteered to maintain 32-on-32 that's not actually
solving the complexity problem, just perpetuating it.

The current maintainers only interested in XX-on-64 will still suffer
ongoing burden from the code complexity caused by 32-on-32 merely
existing.

So again lets be clear...

Either we...

 * ...want to kill 32-on-32 code to reduce the complexity on the
   main XX-on-64 codebase regardless of interest in 32-on-32

Or

 * ...want to kill 32-on-32 code because it is buggy due to lack
   of maintainers, but would welcome someone to step forward to
   maintain it

It sounded like we were wanting the former, not the latter.

With regards,
Daniel
