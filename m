I suspect this works because KVM only calls gup on faults and if the memory
was pre-faulted via memfd_secret there won't be faults and no gups from
KVM.

I agree with Sean, guest_memfd seems a better interface to use. It's
integrated by design with KVM and removing guest memory from the direct map
looks like a natural enhancement to guest_memfd. 

Unless I'm missing something, for fast-and-dirty POC it'll be a oneliner
that adds set_memory_np() to kvm_gmem_get_folio() and then figuring out
what to do with virtio :)
