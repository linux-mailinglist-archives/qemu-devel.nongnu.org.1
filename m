Thanks for your comments.

However, I'm not really sure what you're talking about. If we make
mux_chr_can_read return either zero or one (as I've done in the patch),
do you mean that we are still at risk of losing some escape sequences?

In mux_proc_byte, we set d->term_got_escape to 1 when we see the escape
character. As far as I can see, the escape sequence is always handled
correctly. So I don't understand how losing escape sequences can happen.

Would you mind explaining this in more detail?
