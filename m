It is policy that we should be creating issues in gitlab for any
flaky tests. I wouldn't say we've been perfect at that, but we
should be doing it, and that link ought to be linked in the code
if we disable the test there.

The migration subsystem was definitely suffering from insufficient
maintainer resources available historically, which is reflected
in some of the testing problems we've had & largely how I ended
up spending so much time on migration code too.

In the qtests/meson.build, I see we register separate
suites - a generic "qtest" suite, and a "qtest-$TARGET"
suite. What's missing here is a suite for subsystem
classification, which I guess is more or less what you
proposed here for migration.

How about (in addition to the idea of splitting migration-test
into one part run for all targets, and one part run for just
one target), we generalize this concept to work for any
subsystem tagging

qtest_subsystems = {
  'migration-test': ['migration'],
  'cdrom-test': ['block'],
  'ahci-test': ['block'],
  ....
}


then when registering tests we could do

   suites = ['qtest', 'qtest-' + target_base]
   foreach subsys: qtest_subsystems.get(test, [])
     suites += ['qtest-' + subsys, 'qtest-' + target_base + '-' + subsys]
   endforeach

   test(....
         suite: suites)

that would give us a way to run just the migration tests, or
just the migration tests on x86_64, etc, likewise for other
subsystems we want to tag, while still keeping 'make check-qtest'
as the full coverage.

Yep, we need more investment in our CI resources. There were some
ideas discussed at KVM Forum that could help with this, which
should be publicised soon.

Mostly starts with the standard glib test program setup, where by
you create a tests/unit/test-<blah>.c file, with functions for
each test case that you register with g_test_add, same as qtest.

The key difference from qtest is that you then just directly
link the test binary to the code to be tested, and call into
it internal QEMU APIs directly. In this case, it would involve
linking to the 'libmigration' meson static library object.
