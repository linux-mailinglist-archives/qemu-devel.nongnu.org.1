If the VM is going to be powered off immediately after saving
a snapshot then yes, you might as well pause it, but we can't
assume that will be the case.  An equally common use case
would be for saving periodic snapshots of a running VM. This
should be transparent such that the VM remains running the
whole time, except a narrow window at completion of RAM/state
saving where we flip the disk snapshots, so they are in sync
with the RAM snapshot.

IOW, save/restore to disk can imply paused, but snapshotting
should not imply paused. So I don't see an unambiguous
rationale that we should diverge when fixed-ram is set and
auto-pause the VM.

Skipping dirty page tracking would imply that the mgmt app cannot
resume CPUs without either letting the operation complete, or
aborting it.

That is probably a reasonable assumption, as I can't come up with
a use case for starting out paused and then later resuming, unless
there was a scearnio where you needed to synchronous something
external with the start of migration.  Sychronizing storage though
is something that happens at the end of migration instead.

Can we really release resources early ?  If the save operation fails
right at the end, we want to be able to resume execution of CPUs,
which assumes all resources are still available, otherwise we have
a failure scenario where we've not successfully saved to disk and
also don't still have the running QEMU.

The time may not be very short for large VMs.
