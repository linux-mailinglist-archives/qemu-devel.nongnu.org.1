Apparently "qemu/notify.h" could be use for QAPI events (currently
only used by migration). Big change, to be discussed later.

Good spot, it is where we call synchronize_pre_resume() for vCPUs,
which is exactly what Daniil wants for RTC devices.

I'd rather we call here rtc_synchronize_pre_resume(), which would
mostly be qmp_rtc_inject_irq_broadcast() content, without using QMP
at all.

But for back-compat we need some CLI option "sync-rtc-on-resume"
default to false. Preferably a mc146818rtc property to KISS.

That would solve Daniil problem and make Markus/myself happier.

Paolo, any objection?

Regards,

Phil.
