Not in upstream yet but Gregory posted emulation support last year.
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20241018161252.8896-1-gourry@gourry.net/
I'm carrying the patches on my staging tree.

https://gitlab.com/jic23/qemu/-/commits/cxl-2025-02-20?ref_type=heads

Longer term I remain a little unconvinced by whether this is the best approach
because I also want a single management path (so fake CCI etc) and that may
need to be exposed to one of the hosts for tests purposes.  In the current
approach commands are issued to each host directly to surface memory.

There is some information in that patch series cover letter.

No problem.
