In e76ae52747a8 ("KVM: x86/pmu: Gate all "unimplemented MSR" prints on
report_ignored_msrs"), in "disabled perfctr wrmsr" case, vcpu_unimpl()
is no longer forced for counter MSRs, so most of the above warnings go away.

For the remaining warnings, vcpu_unimpl() is ratelimitedm and plus all
these logs can be removed by setting report_ignored_msrs=false.

So, it should be not that bad now.

Even with /sys/module/kvm/parameters/enable_pmu=Y, theoretically it's
possible for kvm->arch.enable_pmu to be false. In such a case, vPMU
could still be advertised, and QEMU doens't know that vPMU is not
supported by KVM, on either Intel or AMD platforms.

Anyway, this is likely only a theoretical scenario and may not actually
happens in practice.
