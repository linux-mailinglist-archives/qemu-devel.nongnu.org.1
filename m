I think it is OK to miss tracing as an exceptional one-off.

It is highly undesirable though for us to convert more than a
couple of devices (which currently use tracing) without having
tracing working. I consider tracing a critical feature for
supportability of QEMU.

IOW, I'm OK with lack of tracing not being a block for defaulting
to --enable-rust, provided it is accepted as being a high priority
item. Possibly call it a blocker for accepting conversions of
anything beyond pl011 & hpet, that currently has trace points.

As mentioned above, IMHO this needs to be treated as a high priority
item. While it would make a good Outreachy/GSoC project, I don't think
we should take that path, as it comes with no guarantee of a successful
timely delivery.

Note that it is not unbounded printf style formatting. We are actually
pretty restricted in what we can use because our format strings are
required to be compatible with systemtap's formatter which is very
limited compared to C printf().

We've currently got an adhoc check to block use of '%m', but we could
easily make this a much stricter check on '%' and thus make it practical
to auto-convert our printf() style format strings to a format that rust
can use natively.

IMHO high priority. I don't want to enable Rust in Fedora/RHEL if
it going to degrade our ability to use tracing to debug production
deployments

With regards,
Daniel
