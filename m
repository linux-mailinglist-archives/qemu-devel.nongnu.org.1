I'm not sure if you mean you'd prefer to eradicate #if completely.

We have to keep in mind that some config host #if have to stay there, or 
they expose things that the rest of QEMU code is not supposed to see 
(hidden under those same CONFIG_ ifdef also).
So we would need both if and runtime_if.

I agree on that, and I'm not sure that introducing another level of 
symbolic names (target-s390x vs target_s390x()) to match the same C 
function name really adds any value to the QAPI definition.
As mentioned before, it's easy to guarantee that the function is named 
the same in any language, and ban any use of C complex expression 
(through code review), so the argument about generating bindings in 
other languages does not really matter IMHO.
