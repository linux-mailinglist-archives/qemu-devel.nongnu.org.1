Thank you, will fix it!

We've noticed this and decided to fix it in the future. I think the 
problem lies when PCM release is called from the guest. Quoting the 
spec:

  The device MUST complete all pending I/O messages for the specified 
  stream ID.
  The device MUST NOT complete the control request while there are 
  pending I/O messages for the specified stream ID.

When RELEASE is received, buffers are simply dropped. This is pure 
conjecture but I think creating an in-device buffer could solve this.
Unless the bug is found to be caused by something else, I settled on 
accepting it for this patch series because it is spec conformant.

Can you elaborate? Do you mean you repeat the same process as before, 
but the stall happens immediately? I personally rarely get any drops I 
could notice, only one or two for many minutes of playback / capture. I 
also could not reproduce exactly the same behavior you had in the 
previous version. The bugs *were* there but it was not as severe. Maybe 
it's a hardware performance issue? Can someone else test this too? It'd 
be helpful.

Thank you very much for your help,
Manos
