It is true for udmabuf, though the memfds that back udmabuf are directly 
mapped instead; I don't think the indirection of udmabuf makes any 
difference.

If it's only for future DMA-BUF exporter, it is better to make the 
change when the exporter is actually added, or we are adding code that 
cannot be tested right now and may or may not work when such an exporter 
is added.

We should be able to safely assume it never happens due to the "no 
regressions" rule of Linux. If a userspace program breaks due to a UAPI 
change, the UAPI change is a breaking change, which kernel developers 
carefully avoid.

Existing QEMU versions will break if such a change happens. Perhaps the 
no regressions policy may be exempted if the relevant userspace program 
is so broken that it depends on something never meant to be stable, but 
it is not the case.
