Currently, QEMU supports emulating either stage-1 or stage-2 SMMUs
but not nested instances.
This patch series adds support for nested translation in SMMUv3,
this is controlled by property =E2=80=9Carm-smmuv3.stage=3Dnested=E2=80=9D,=
 and
advertised to guests as (IDR0.S1P =3D=3D 1 && IDR0.S2P =3D=3D 2)

Main changes(architecture):
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D
1) CDs are considered IPA and translated with stage-2.
2) TTBx and tables for stage-1 are considered IPA and translated
   with stage-2.
3) Translate the IPA address with stage-2.

TLBs:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
TLBs are the most tricky part.

1) General design
   Unified(Combined) design is used, where entries with ASID=3D-1 are
   IPAs(cached from stage-2 config)

   TLBs are also modified to cache 2 permissions, a new permission added
   "parent_perm."

   For non-nested configuration, perm =3D=3D parent_perm and nothing
   changes. This is used to know which stage to use in case there is
   a permission fault from a TLB entry.

2) Caching in TLB
   Stage-1 and stage-2 are inserted in the TLB as is.
   For nested translation, both entries are combined into one TLB
   entry. The size (level and granule) are chosen from the smallest entries=
.
   That means that a stage-1 translation can be cached with sage-2
   granule in key, this is taken into account for lookup.

3) TLB Lookup
   TLB lookup already uses ASID in key, so it can distinguish between
   stage-1 and stage-2.
   And as mentioned above, the granule for stage-1 can be different,
   If stage-1 lookup failed, we try again with the stage-2 granule.

4) TLB invalidation
   - Address invalidation is split, for IOVA(CMD_TLBI_NH_VA
     /CMD_TLBI_NH_VAA) and IPA(CMD_TLBI_S2_IPA) based on ASID value
   - CMD_TLBI_NH_ASID/CMD_TLBI_NH_ALL: Consider VMID if stage-2 is
     supported, and invalidate stage-1 only by VMIDs

As far as I understand, this is compliant with the ARM architecture:
- ARM ARM DDI 0487J.a: RLGSCG, RTVTYQ, RGNJPZ
- ARM IHI 0070F.b: 16.2 Caching

An alternative approach would be to instantiate 2 TLBs, one per each
stage. I haven=E2=80=99t investigated that.

Others
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
- Advertise SMMUv3.2-S2FWB, it is NOP for QEMU as it doesn=E2=80=99t suppor=
t
  attributes.

- OAS: A typical setup with nesting is to share CPU stage-2 with the
  SMMU, and according to the user manual, SMMU OAS must match the
  system physical address.

  This was discussed before in
  https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230226220650.1480786-11-smostafa@google.com=
/
  This series doesn=E2=80=99t implement that, but reworks OAS to make it ea=
sier
  to configure in the future.

- For nested configuration, IOVA notifier only notifies for stage-1
  invalidations (as far as I understand this is the intended
  behaviour as it notifies for IOVA).

- Stop ignoring VMID for stage-1 if stage-2 is also supported.


Future improvements:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
1) One small improvement, that I don=E2=80=99t think it=E2=80=99s worth the=
 extra
   complexity, is in case of Stage-1 TLB miss for nested translation,
   we can do stage-1 walk and lookup for stage-2 TLBs, instead of
   doing the full walk.

Testing
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
1) IOMMUFD + VFIO
   Kernel: https://lore.kernel.org/all/cover.1683688960.git.nicolinc@nvidia=
.com/
   VMM: https://qemu-devel.nongnu.narkive.com/o815DqpI/rfc-v5-0-8-arm-smmuv=
3-emulation-support

   By assigning =E2=80=9Cvirtio-net-pci,netdev=3Dnet0,disable-legacy=3Don,i=
ommu_platform=3Don,ats=3Don=E2=80=9D,
   to a guest VM (on top of QEMU guest) with VIFO and IOMMUFD.

2) Work in progress prototype I am hacking on for nesting on KVM
   (this is nowhere near complete, and misses many stuff but it
   doesn't require VMs/VFIO) also with virtio-net-pci and git
   cloning a bunch of stuff and also observing traces.
   https://android-kvm.googlesource.com/linux/+log/refs/heads/smostafa/andr=
oid15-6.6-smmu-nesting-wip

Overall I tested the following configurations
(S1 =3D 4k, S2 =3D4k):
- S1 level =3D 1 and S2 level =3D 1
- S1 level =3D 1 and S2 level =3D 2
- S1 level =3D 1 and S2 level =3D 3
- S1 level =3D 2 and S2 level =3D 1
- S1 level =3D 2 and S2 level =3D 2
- S1 level =3D 2 and S2 level =3D 3
- S1 level =3D 3 and S2 level =3D 2
- S1 level =3D 3 and S2 level =3D 3
Also did some testing with
(S1 =3D 16k, S2=3D 4k)
(S1 =3D 4K, S2=3D 16k)
