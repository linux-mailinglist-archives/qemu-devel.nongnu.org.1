Setting it to false was a safety measure.  Indeed not needed, but when so
we need to be extremely careful to always check with above two conditions
to avoid it frequently triggers.  So I thought clearing it would be much
easier to read.  I can wait and read the new version whatever you prefer.

Right.

Though since we want to move to POSTCOPY_ACTIVE asap when receiving the
corresponding PONG, we may want to have something like qemu_event_read()
just return "ev->value == EV_SET", as we can't event_wait() in the
migration thread while pushing RAMs.

Or, to avoid touching library code, we can also introduce yet another bool,
then when receiving the PONG we set both (1) the bool, and (2) the event.
We can check the bool in the iterations (when set, wait() to consume the
event; the event should have happened or just to happen), and wait() on the
event when completing (when return, bool must have been set, hence can
reset bool).
