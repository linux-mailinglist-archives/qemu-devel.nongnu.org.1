I understand we have something like this:

* true: on if possible, else off

* false: off (always possible)

Which one is the default?

There is no way to reliably configure "on", i.e. fail if it's not
possible.  I agree that's a problem.

I guess you're proposing something like this:

* auto: on if possible, else off

* on: on if possible, else error

* off: off (always possible)

Which one is the default?

Yes, converting bool to OnOffAuto is an incompatible change.

It also affects existing uses of OnOffAuto, where such a change is
unnecessary and undesirable.

The parenthesis is inaccurate.  This patch only affects qdev properties.
It does not affect use of OnOffAuto elsewhere, e.g. QOM object
"sev-guest" property "legacy-vm-type", or QMP command blockdev-add
argument "locking" with driver "file".

> 2. Let OnOffAuto and bool accept JSON bool and deprecate "on"/"off"
> 3. Let OnOffAuto and bool accept "on"/"off" and deprecate JSON bool

For each of these options:

(a) Change exactly the uses of OnOffAuto that need to become tri-state

(b) Change all qdev properties (currently a superset of (a); what this
   patch does)

(c) Change all uses of OnOffAuto

I dislike (c) and especially (b).

We managed to maneuver ourselves into a bit of a corner in just a few
simple steps:

* The obvious type for a flag is bool.

* The obvious type for a small set of values is enum.

* Thus, the obvious type for a tri-state is enum.

* But this prevents growing a flag into a tri-state compatibly.  Which
  is what you want to do.

However, we actually have a second way to do a tri-state: optional bool,
i.e. present and true, present and false, absent.

Permit me a digression...  I'm not a fan of assigning "absent" a meaning
different from any present value.  But it's a design choice QAPI made.

Using optional that way can occasionally lead to trouble.  Consider
migrate-set-parameters.  Its arguments are all optional.  For each
argument present, the respective migration parameter is set to the
argument value.  You cannot use this to reset a migration parameter from
present to absent.  Matters for parameters where "absent" has a meaning
different from any "present" value.

End of digression.

Start of next digression :)

Note that qdev properties are generally optional.  The only way to make
them mandatory is to reject their default value in .realize().  When
users set this default value explicitly, the error message will almost
certainly be confusing.

End of digression.

Optional bool may enable a fourth solution:

4. Make "absent" mean on if possible, else off, "present and true" mean
   on if possible, else error, and "present and false" mean off (always
   possible).

   This changes the meaning of "present and true", but it's precisely
   the change you want, isn't it?

Yet another solutions:

5. Alternate of bool and an enum with a single value "auto".

   Falls apart with the keyval visitor used for the command line.
   Fixable, I believe, but a good chunk of work and complexity.

My gut feeling: explore 4. first.
