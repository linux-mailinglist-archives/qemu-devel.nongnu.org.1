I don't think "hiding" is the same thing as "disabling"? The underlying
behaviour will still have changed, the main question is whether that is
a problem.

It implies that QEMU (or generally the VMM) needs to actively disable
everything it does not know about (i.e. setting everything in any
writable id reg to zero if it has no idea what it is about) to provide a
stable guest interface across different kernels. Just tweaking some
known values is only sufficient for a stable interface across two
systems with the same kernel.

Not sure if I understand what you mean, but "give me the contents of all
id registers, and which registers are writable" should probably do the
trick?
