I had that strong feeling mostly because I'm a migration developer and
migration reviewer, so I suffer on both sides. :) I was trying to stand out
for either any future author/reviewer from that pov, but I think indeed the
ultimate consumer is the reader.

Fundamentally to solve the problem, maybe we must dedup the objects rather
than the documents only?  I'll try to dig a bit more in this area next week
if I have time, any link for previous context would be welcomed (or obvious
reason that we just won't be able to do that; I only know that at least
shouldn't be trivial to resolve).

For this one - Markus, let me know what do you think, or I'll simply repost
v3 with the duplications (when needed, probably later not sooner).

Thanks,
