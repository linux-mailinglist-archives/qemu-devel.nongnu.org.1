QMP doesn't support warnings, so they go to stderr instead, where they
may or may not be seen.

When I instruct a program to do X, I prefer it to do exactly X, and fail
when that's not possible.  Correcting X behind my back may be friendly,
until the day I spent quality time figuring out WTF is going on.

Perhaps this one is a matter of documentation.  As is, @multi-conn feels
like "set the number of connections" to me, until I read the fine print,
which contradicts it.  We could perhaps phrase it as a limit instead:
enable multiple connections and simultaneously limit their number.

Is it the arbitrarily chosen maximum for QEMU, or is it the well-known
maximum for NBD, or is it something else?

Let's get the QAPI schema doc comment right before we worry about this
one.
