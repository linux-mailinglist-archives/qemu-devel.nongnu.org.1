TBH, it's not clear to me that 2b8fe81b3c2e is correct.  We implemented
the ram_device MemoryRegion specifically to avoid memory access
optimizations that are not compatible with MMIO, but I see that these
{ld,st}*_he_pe operations are using __builtin_memcpy.  I'm not a
compiler aficionado, but is __builtin_memcpy guaranteed to use an
instruction set compatible with MMIO?

Cc: folks related to that commit.

The original issue that brought us ram_device was a very obscure
alignment of a memory region versus a device quirk only seen with
assignment of specific RTL NICs.

The description for commit 4a2e242bbb30 ("memory: Don't use memcpy for
ram_device regions") also addresses unaligned accesses, we don't expect
drivers to use them and we don't want them to work differently in a VM
than they might on bare metal.  We can debate whether that's valid or
not, but that was the intent.

Have we re-introduced the chance that we're using optimized
instructions only meant to target RAM here or is __builtin_memcpy
implicitly safe for MMIO?  Thanks,

Alex
