Yes, no one requires it must be power-of-2. But power-of-2 is just
the result, not the reason.

The core point is not power-of-2, but is the meaning of EBX[23:16].

Sorry, I have to re-emphasize:

Pls remember it's not real number of logical processors per package,
and it's "addressable ID", which is the initial APIC ID. The maximum
capacity of addressable ID is calculated by the APIC layout, and the
final value is “power-of-2”. The calculation by APIC ID or pow2ceil()
are mathematically equivalent. That's the way to get addressable IDs.

The spec is expressed in such a way to help software understands this
value, while the QEMU is designed to emulate hardware behavior.

Again, I suggest you think in terms of the meaning of number of
addressable IDs, it's not a matter of how power-of-2 is calculated, you
can choose to calculate number of addressable IDs in other ways, but
the final value is still a power of 2.
