Correct me if I'm wrong on this, but shouldn't the 'pty' chardev also
be able to take advantage of the same size change mechanisms as the
'stdio' chardev (receiving SIGWINCH and being able to use the ioctl
TIOCGWINSZ)? If so the work for the 'stdio' chardev should probably be
replicated for the 'pty' chardev.=20
