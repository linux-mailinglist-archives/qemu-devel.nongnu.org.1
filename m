It isn't just about the amount of code, it is the familiarity of the
code. QEMU's codebase is glib based, by using glib functionality we
leverage developers' general familiarity with / knowledge of glib,
as opposed to custom QEMU approaches which need learning.

If we need to depend on something that is newer than our min glib version,
then we add back compat definitino to 'include/glib-compat.h' for the older
version.

My impression seeing this series, was exactly the opposite. I did not
like 'fallthrough' blending in with the rest of code, and also did not
like that it is a macro in lowercase, thus hiding that it is a macro

We're at least a decade away from being able to use anything from C23.
