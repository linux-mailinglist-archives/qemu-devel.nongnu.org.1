The migration overall can detect whether EOF should have been reached,
but multifd threads cannot. If one multifd channel experiences an issue
and sees a premature termination, but ignores it, then that's a hang in
QEMU because nothing provided the syncs needed (p->sem_sync, most
likely).

Aren't we just postponing a bug?
