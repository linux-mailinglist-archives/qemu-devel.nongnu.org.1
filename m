You mean that we can have a call stack that looks something like...

<qemu code>
|_ pl011_read
  |_ PL011State::read()
     |_ qemu_chr_fe_accept_input()
      |_ pl011_read
        |_ PL011State::read()

If I understand correctly, this does not create another "&mut self", 
because a mutable reference of self is passed to 
qemu_chr_fe_accept_input(), and only exists until it returns.

In any case, I agree that these subtleties must be examined thoroughly 
in general. In this case though PL011State has only Copy fields and no 
side effects when dropped. This means that adding interior mutability 
e.g. with Cell would have exactly the same behavior.

But your bringing it up makes me wonder whether we can detect any bad 
behaviors with miri... It does not play well with FFI boundaries but 
it's possible to mock them in some cases. I will look into the two TODOs 
you mention and also if it's possible to verify the correct behavior 
whenever possible!

>(also for the parent).

That was my approach at the beginning but I was having issues with the 
linker stripping the <some const value>.as_ptr() and it would point to 
invalid memory; I checked it again and I think using #[used] just for 
the TypeInfo struct declaration might be enough so these can be removed.

Well, it's just that I personally don't view adding __attribute__ 
manually in only two places is a burden but I've no strong preference 
over it.

I'm looking at the ctor dependencies and they are a few:
https://github.com/mmastrac/rust-ctor/blob/cc3ab9160ed9dc3bdf20d735352b519abc2913e9/Cargo.lock

Do you perhaps agree with adding a FIXME comment to replace the linker 
attributes with ctor when we get the cargo dependency story in meson 
sorted out?

Manos
