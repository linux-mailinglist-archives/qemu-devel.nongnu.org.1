Disabling a profile is certainly odd, because I wouldn't expect profiles
to be used with any CPU type other than a base type, i.e. they should be
used to enable extensions on a barebones CPU model, which means setting
them off would be noops.  And, if a profile is set off for a cpu model
where extensions are set either by the model or by previous profile and
extension properties, then it also seems like an odd use, but that's at
least consistent with how other properties would work, so I'm not sure we
need to forbid it.

I think it's possible users will want to describe platforms which are
compatible with more than one profile, e.g. RVA22U64=on,RVA24U64=on.

The example I gave Andrea about this was that C may get demoted from
mandatory to optional in later profiles. If a platform is built which
conforms to an older profile with C and to the later profile where C
is only optional, then enabling both profiles will ensure that C is
enabled, whereas only enabling the later profile will not, and then
C must be added manually after inspecting the older profile to see
what will be missed. OIOW, the burden of individual extension management
will still be present if only single profiles may be enabled at a time.
(And, even if the later profile was a strict superset of the older one,
then, if a user wants to explicitly describe a platform which claims
compatibility with both profiles, they probably shouldn't be punished
for it, even if the resulting extension enablement would be equivalent
to only enabling the later profile.)

Thanks,
