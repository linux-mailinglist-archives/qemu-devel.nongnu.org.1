It would be great if you could include the Yongfeng cache-model patch in your v2 
series. Let me know if you need any more information about the Yongfeng cache 
model. After you submit v2, I can review the Zhaoxin parts and make any 
necessary code changes if needed.

And thanks again for taking Zhaoxin into account.
