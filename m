Could this be culled now?

Hmm, according to mypy(1), strict implies warn-unused-configs.

The question does not block this patch.

mypy(1) makes me suspect this is the default.  If that's true across the
versions we care for, this could be culled.

Also does not block this patch.

Harmless enough.

Also present in the deleted file, so no change.

Fair enough.

Good.

Let's mention the differences in the commit message.  Here's my try:

    Since the previous commit, python/setup.cfg applies to scripts/qapi/
    as well.  Configuration files in scripts/qapi/ override
    python/setup.cfg.

    scripts/qapi/.flake8 and scripts/qapi/.isort.cfg actually match
    python/setup.cfg exactly, and can go.

    The differences between scripts/qapi/mypy.ini and python/setup.cfg
    are harmless: [list the differences, explain why they're harmless as
    long as you can keep it brief, and if not, fall back to "trust me"].
    So scripts/qapi/mypy.ini can go, too.

    The pylint config is being left in place because the settings differ
    enough from the python/ directory settings that we need a chit-chat on
    how to merge them O:-)

With something like that
