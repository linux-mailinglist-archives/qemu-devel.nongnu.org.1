Yes, it can. And regardless of the way we chose: qdev properties or qapi,
I don't think we need a property for backend itself. We need a property
(or migration capability) for vhost-user-blk itself, saying that its
backend should be migrated.

It's a lot simpler to migrate backend inside of frontend state. If we
migrate backend in separate, we can't control the order of backend/frontend
stats, and will have to implement some late point in state load process,
where both are already loaded and we can do our post-load logic.
