Yes, you are right. The same test failed for me locally due to the usage 
of /var/tmp/ path but that's not what was originally reported.

I am not aware that user-started programs can have an exception from 
having their profiles applied, nor do I know whether rules exist that 
allow a user to circumvent any rule. So my guess is we need rules like 
either one of the following:

owner /mnt/** rwkl

or worse:

owner /** rwkl

I don't see another choice than adding one of these rules, maybe even 
the 2nd. Lena?

and from what I know we need explicit rules for allowing paths.

We haven't run into this type of a problem with paths in a while. The 
applications return 'permission denied' but to find the exact reason 
(LSM) for it one may have to dig into the audit log.
