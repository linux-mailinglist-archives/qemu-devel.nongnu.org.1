Cédric sent me the reports separately. They are (as far as I'm able to tell
without a coverity login) all false positives, except the uninitialized variable
one which I have sent a patch for.

The locking reports don't realize the proxy->lock is already held.

But rethinking about this one, it's theoretically possible, I suppose, if we
happen get a signal before we actually close. I'll figure out a patch, thanks.
