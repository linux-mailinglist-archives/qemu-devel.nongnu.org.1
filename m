Ah yeah, I somehow remembered we sent a SYNC in the main channel but forgot
to push the per-channel SYNC.  I got it the other way round.  Yeah if data
is always ordered with shutdown() effect on recv then it seems in order.

If we want to reference them after all, we could use another sentence to
describe the effects:

       *   Commit 637280aeb2 (since 9.1) introduced a side effect to cause
       *   pre-mature termination not happen, while commit 1d457daf86
       *   (since 10.0) can unexpectedly re-expose the pre-mature
       *   termination issue.

If we take Dan's comment into account:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/Z6I86e-hzJAlxk0r@redhat.com

It means whenever multifd recv thread invokes the iochannel API it will use
multifd_clean_tls_termination to decide QIO_CHANNEL_READ_RELAXED_EOF flag
to pass in.  I hope this is not layer violation, or I could miss something..

So if we're on the same page we need that knob, to make this series easier
we could make it two steps:

  - Step 1: introduce the parameter and QIO_CHANNEL_READ_RELAXED_EOF, set
    it default to false.

  - Step 2: Your other RFC series to implement gnutls_bye(), at last make
    it a compat property and switch default true.

Then Maciej only needs step 1, it looks to me.
