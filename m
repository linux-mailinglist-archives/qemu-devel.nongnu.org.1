It is certainly the case for Tier 1/2 platforms, that a known build
issue must not be willfully merged into master.

That's not the case for Tier 3, since we can't guarantee that the QEMU
code builds successfully to begin with. If we do a see a probable issue
in a Tiar 3 platform build, and its easy to resolve then we should. We
can't gate on every Tier 3 problem given the lack of guaranteed working
dev/test envs and lack of CI.

Ideally we should not have any platforms listed under Tier 3 at all,
but today we do. May be some will graduate to Tier 2 at some point.

I don't speak for all maintainers, but personally I've no desire
to increase use of github for QEMU, or indeed any other projects.

The choice of platform is about more than just possible features.
The ability to control our own destiny, and maintain use of OSS
infrastructure was/is important.

GitLab is certainly not perfect, but gitlab.com was an acceptable
tradeoff with the ability to switch to self-hosted Gitlab since
it is based on OSS. Beyond that we could also migrate to Forgejo/
Codeberg. Tieing ourselves into GitHub's fully proprietary service
has never really been on the table for QEMU.

With regards,
Daniel
