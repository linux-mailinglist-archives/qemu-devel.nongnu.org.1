I've not really understood how to assemble more complex setups using
qemu's commandline when the board already creates some of the devices.=C2=
=A0

Perhaps C=C3=A9dric can explain how the different boot options are
configured for aspeed?

I see three cases:
1. specify the blockdev driver and options in the simple case where the
board already creates the SD or eMMC device
2. specify some custom options for the eMMC
3. create a custom eMMC config on a generic machine via sdhci-pci


Case 1 is probably most common. The user has chosen a board and just
wants to boot a rootfs image and doesn't care about boot partitions or
anything else eMMC-specific.


Some users may want to emulate an eMMC with boot partitions, as that
allows them to emulate their physical boards more closely (case 2).
Note that eMMC boot partitions are usually *not* used for storing a
Linux kernel, but for the bootloader (including things like u-boot, TF-
A, OP-TEE, ...). The ROM-code on many SoCs supports loading directly
from eMMC boot partitions. One of the two boot partitions can be
activated with an atomic eMMC EXT CSD register write, allowing atomic
bootloader updates. I think this case was the motivation for C=C3=A9dric's
eea55625df83 ("aspeed: Introduce a AspeedSoCClass 'boot_from_emmc'
handler").

These users are likely fine with assembling a backing file consisting
of e.g.
- bootloader image (boot0) @ offset 0MiB
- empty space for bootloader updates (boot1) @ offset 1MiB
- partitioned disk image (rootfs, ...) @ offset 2MiB
to get the same setup as their real hardware.


Case 3 is what I want to use the eMMC emulator for: Test eMMC-specific
functionality in Linux userspace, specifically the boot partition
update backend for RAUC, in a CI setup. To improve performance and
because we don't need to emulate any specific board for CI, we use an
x86 guest (q35). As it has PCIe, the easiest way to add the necessary
eMMC emulation is to use sdhci-pci. That was the motivation behind my
patch "hw/sd/sdcard: Allow user creation of eMMCs" [1].

For that case, having one backing file for boot partitions + main area
is fine as well.


If we wanted more flexibility via separate backing files per eMMC
partitions, it might work similar to NVMe Namespaces [2]. For me, that
seems like a lot of complexity a very niche case like eMMC boot
partitions.


Potential future features such as more eMMC data partitions, RPMB
support or separate backing files could be support in QEMU by new eMCC
device options or even additional devices (following the NVMe
approach), without breaking backwards compatibility.

So it seems to me, that C=C3=A9dric's approach of enabling boot partitions
in hw/arm/aspeed.c only when configured to boot from them via the "hw-
strap1" property should solve cases 1 and 2 without introducing
backwards compatibility issues. Case 3 has explicit configuration (if a
boot partition is emulated), so shouldn't be a problem either.


Thanks,
