Hi Prasad (and also welcome folks correct me),

SMPConfiguration is created and set in machine_set_smp().

Firstly, it is created by g_autoptr(), and then it is initialized by
visit_type_SMPConfiguration().

The visit_type_SMPConfiguration() is generated by
gen_visit_object_members() in scripts/qapi/visit.py.

The g_autoptr() requires user to initialize:

  You must initialise the variable in some way â€” either by use of an
  initialiser or by ensuring that it is assigned to unconditionally
  before it goes out of scope.

This means if user doesn't initialize some field, the the value should
be considerred as unreliable. And I guess for int, the default
initialization value is the same as if we had declared a regular integer
variable. But anyway, fields that are not explicitly initialized should
not be accessed.

IIUC, in visit_type_SMPConfiguration() (let's have a look at
gen_visit_object_members()), there's no explicit initialization of
SMPConfiguration() (i.e., the parameter named "%(c_name)s *obj" in
gen_visit_object_members()). For int type, has_* means that the field is
set.

Therefore, we shouldn't rely on the uninitialized fields and should
check the has_*.

It's not a bug, and it could be a simplification of the automatic code
generation.

I realized that keeping the check for has_* here would help improve code
readability; after all, it's more of a pain to go back and check
scripts.

This doesn't work since the above check is used to identify if user sets
parameters as 0 explicitly, which needs to check both has_* and the
specific field value.

(Communicating with you also helped me to understand the QAPI related
parts.)

Thanks,
Zhao
