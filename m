In fact, KVM does support different address space for supporting SMM 
mode. There is KVM_CAP_MULTI_ADDRESS_SPACE to report how many address 
space is supported by KVM.

(It turns out my memory on KVM is correct. I was misled by QEMU code and 
comment)

QEMU allocates separate KVM address space for SMM in 
register_smram_listener(). But the address space doesn't associated with 
cpu's address space.

I think this patch can only avoid the assertion in you case when vcpu is 
in SMM mode with KVM. But with this patch, do you get the correct info 
of SMM mode dumped? I guess no, since the info is of address space 0, 
not the SMM address space.

If there is no reason of cannot associate KVM's address space with cpu's 
address space, I think the right fix is to enable the association with 
them.

Based on above, I need to withdraw my Reviewed-by.
