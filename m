Ok, so that could only mean a thread stuck in recv() while holding the
BQL. I don't think we have any other locks which would stop
migrate_cancel from making progress or other stall situations that could
be helped by a shutdown(). Note that most of locks around qemu_file were
a late addition. I don't think that scenario is possible today. I'll
have to do some tests.

On that note, how is yank supposed to be accessed? I don't see support
in libvirt. Is there a way to hook into QMP after the fact somehow?
