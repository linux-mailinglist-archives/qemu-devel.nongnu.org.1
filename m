Paolo, we have a (minor) bug, and two fixes, this series, and
Marc-Andr=C3=A9's "[PATCH] RFC: qdev: add legacy properties only for those
print()-able"
Message-ID: <20251015105419.2975542-1-marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

Would be nice to get a fix into 10.2.  I'll post a pull request for mine
unless you tell me not to bother.
