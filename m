The commit 00268e0002 makes a difference only for the case "-cpu 
xxx,pdcm=on" without "pmu=on", and it emits a warning and sets the PDCM 
in cpu->filtered_features[].

So libvirt must first request with "-cpu xxx,pdcm=on" without "pmu=on" 
and gets the result that PDCM is filtered (set in cpu->filtered_features[]).

This indeed introduces the behavior change that before the commit, "-cpu 
xxx,pdcm=on" without "pmu=on" doesn't get warning nor PDCM is set in 
cpu->filtered_features[], but PDCM is just not set in guest's CPUID.

I couldn't understand how the warning or PDCM is set in 
cpu->filtered_features[] breaks save/restore and migration.
