Right, the thing is that we already did before the code something wrong
if you take a look at the old vhost_user_mem_section_filter().

Passing MAP_PRIVATE memory to a vhost-user device and having it work on 
the shared memory cannot possibly work correctly.

So IIUC, commit 552b25229cf didn't change the behavior, it only 
highlighted the existing problem.

So I agree, resolving this TODO is great -- back then I wasn't quite 
sure if there are other things we have to consider so I left it alone.
