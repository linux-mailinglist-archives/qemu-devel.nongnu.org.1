It's not how software/OS is supposed to work with x86 architecture.

Though there are different vendors for x86, like Intel and AMD, they 
both implement x86 architecture. For x86 architecture, architectural 
features are enumerated by CPUID. If you read Intel SDM and AMD APM, you 
will find that Intel defines most features at range [0, x] while AMD 
defines most features at range [0x8000 000, 0x8000 000y]. But if a bit 
is defined by both Intel and AMD, it must have same meaning and 
enumerate the same feature.

Usually, a feature is first introduced by one vendor, then other vendors 
might implement the same one later. E.g., bus lock detection, which is 
enumerated via CPUID.7_0:ECX[bit 24] and first introduced by Intel in 
2020. Later, AMD implemented the same one from Zen 5. Before AMD 
implemented it, it was an Intel-only feature. Can we make code as below

    if (is_AMD && cpuid_enumerates_bus_lock_detect)
	error(unsupported CPU);

at that time? If we wrote such code, then it will fail on all the AMD 
Zen 5 CPUs.

Besides, I would like to talk about how software is supposed to deal 
with reserved bits on x86 architecture. In general, software should not 
set any expectation on the reserved bit. The value cannot be relied upon 
to be 0 since any reserved bit can have a meaning in the future. As Igor 
said:

   software shouldn't even try to use it or make any decisions
   based on that

For more information, you can refer to Intel SDM vol1. chapter 1.3.2 
Reserved Bits and Software compatibility. For AMD APM, you would need 
search yourself.

OK, back to the original question "what should the code do?"

My answer is, it can behave with any of below option:

- Be vendor agnostic and stick to x86 architecture. If CPUID enumerates 
a feature, then the feature is available architecturally.

- Based on AMD spec. Ignore the bit since it's a reserved bit. (Expect a 
reserved bit to be zero if not explicitly state by spec is totally wrong!)
