OK that makes sense. One of the main use cases for a modelled SMMU in
QEMU is for developing and testing FEAT_RME (Arm's Confidential
Computing Realm implementation). In that case everything I've seen so
far expects PCI. I guess we can put off any generalisation until we
actually have some use cases that might need it.

Yes - generally I think having a single test device that can be used to
test multiple models will be useful. I guess each qtest will be very
tied to the SMMU it is modelling as it needs to program both sides but
if we take care to encapsulate the programming of the test device and
verification of the results we should be able to ensure good code
re-use.

My only initial thought is the device might be better called
iommu-testdev (as in a device to test IOMMUs, of which the SMMU is one).
