I'm not looking at it from enterprise point of view, but rather from
developers/maintainers side.

it's not only command line, it polluting code all over pc machine
(the recent example, I've touched smbios, where we have legacy mode
only for ISAPC (since 2.0 machine has been deprecated/removed)).

Yep, it should be possible to extract ISA machine at cost of some
duplication and let it slowly continue decay. But it's thanks-less
task and shared code would still remian the issue.

Old QEMU can be used for testing at the cost of few minutes to
create container without much hassle, see my other reply to Philippe.
