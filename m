Thanks for all the answers from all of you.

If we decide to keep COLO, looks like I'll have no choice but understand it
better, as long as it still has anything to do with migration..  I'll leave
some more questions / comments at the end.

Yes this makes sense.  However it is also the very confusing part of COLO.

When I said "I was expecting migration to not be the hot path", one reason
is I believe COLO checkpoint (or say, when migration happens) will
introduce a larger downtime than normal migration, because this process
transfers RAM with both VMs stopped.

You helped explain why that large downtime is needed, thanks.  However then
it means either (1) packet misalignment, or (2) periodical timer kickoff,
either of them will kickoff checkpoint..

I don't know if COLO services care about such relatively large downtime,
especially it is not happening once, but periodically for every tens of
seconds at least (assuming when periodically then packet misalignment is
rare).

IIUC when a heartbeat will be lost on PVM _during_ sync checkpoints, then
SVM can only rollback to the last time checkpoint.  Would this be good
enough in reality?  It means if there's a TCP transaction then it may broke
anyway.  x-checkpoint-delay / periodic checkpoints definitely make this
more possible to happen.

Thank you.  Maybe you should generalize some of the explanations and put it
into docs/devel/migration/ somewhere.  I think many of them are not
mentioned in the doc on how COLO works internally.

Let me ask some more questions while I'm reading COLO today:

- For each of the checkpoint (colo_do_checkpoint_transaction()), COLO will
  do the following:

    bql_lock()
    vm_stop_force_state(RUN_STATE_COLO)     # stop vm
    bql_unlock()

    ...
  
    bql_lock()
    qemu_save_device_state()                # into a temp buffer fb
    bql_unlock()

    ...

    qemu_savevm_state_complete_precopy()    # send RAM, directly to the wire
    qemu_put_buffer(fb)                     # push temp buffer fb to wire

    ...

    bql_lock()
    vm_start()                              # start vm
    bql_unlock()

  A few questions that I didn't ask previously:

  - If VM is stopped anyway, why putting the device states into a temp
    buffer, instead of using what we already have for precopy phase, or
    just push everything directly to the wire?

  - Above operation frequently releases BQL, why is it needed?  What
    happens if (within the window where BQL released) someone invoked QMP
    command "cont" and causing VM to start? Would COLO be broken with it?
    Should we take BQL for the whole process to avoid it?

- Does colo_cache has an limitation, or should we expect SVM to double
  consume the guest RAM size?  As I didn't see where colo_cache will be
  released during each sync (e.g. after colo_flush_ram_cache).  I am
  expecting over time SVM will have most of the pages touched, then the
  colo_cache can consume the same as guest mem on SVM.

Thanks,
