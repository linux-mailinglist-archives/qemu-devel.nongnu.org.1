Are you planning to ultimately upstream support for emulating your SoC?
If you do, is a new emulated board perhaps appropriate?

It's definitely good to have emulation of this fairly common IP.

Within arm virt one concern is that this unconditionally enabled
so attacks on emulation code are a real possibility (in VM usecases)

If you are ultimately emulating a real SoC I'd suggest using
an ID issued by they vendor of the board or the SoC.  They will need
to have a suitable ACPI or PNP ID though (and so be a member of
UEFI.org)  That will allow for any quirks in the kernel driver
(and you'd need to emulate them as well).  Who knows what slight
differences there might be with the Intel version of the IP.

Ah. Ok.  I didn't know about that and couldn't find it in the ACPI
spec :(  A more specific reference like you suggest is fine.
