Desirable, because it's simpler.

Format "raw" was designed to do nothing, so we have a "do nothing"
format for the rigid "format over protocol" system.

We've long acquired the means to use a protocol without a format.  This
made "raw" redundant.  I advocate omitting it, because it only
complicates matters.

Except when you want the one feature "raw" provides beyond "do nothing":
carve a slice with options offset and size (commit 2fdc70452a5 "raw_bsd:
add offset and size options", 2016).

"size" is for slicing.  Can't see how it could simultaneously be
forwarded to the next block driver.
