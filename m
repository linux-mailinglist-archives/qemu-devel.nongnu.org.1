Well the policy is defined in terms of requirements to comply with
the DCO, and that implicitly indicates that the code in question
is eligible for copyright protection to begin with.

IOW, if a change is such that it is not considered eligible for
copyright protection, then you can take the view that it is trivially
DCO compliant, whether you wrote the code, an arbitrary 3rd party
wrote the code, or whether an AI wrote the code.

Trying to detail every possible scenario is impractical and would
make the document too onerous for people to read, remember & apply.
It is better to leave it up to the contributor to decide whether a
change is non-copyrightable, than to try to draw that line crudely
in text. Even for refactoring that line will be fuzzy and contextual,
so not a scenario where we should say any use of AI for reactoring
is OK, as that will lull contributors into having a false sense of
acceptibility, rather than being aware of need to question it. 

With regards,
Daniel
