That looks like an artifical reproducer, rather than the real world
QEMU scenario.

What's the actual I/O stress test scenario you use to reproduce the
problem in QEMU, and how have you configured QEMU (ie what CLI args) ?

I'm fairly inclined to suggest that having such a huge amount of
freed memory is a glibc bug, but to escalate this to glibc requires
us to provide them better real world examples of the problems.

I would note that in systemd they have logic which is monitoring
either /proc/pressure/memory or $CGROUP/memory.pressure, and in
response to events on that, it will call malloc_trim

  https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/main/docs/MEMORY_PRESSURE.md
  https://docs.kernel.org/accounting/psi.html

Something like that might be better, as it lets us hide the specific
design & impl choices inside QEMU, letting us change/evolve them at
will without impacting public API designs.

Daniel
