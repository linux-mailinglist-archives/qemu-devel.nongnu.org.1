A nested hash table for a single entry is overkill.

We are not using the value as a pointer so that should be irrelevant
although generally those bits tend to be at the top of pointers so they
can be masked off.

I'm not sure what we are trying to achieve here. I've got something that
works, doesn't fail any tests and has some guards in for potential
future problems. At the same time I'm not prepared to over-engineer the
solution for a theoretical future problem we haven't got yet.

What about if I just key based of gdb_regnum and we accept that that
might break the one heterogeneous system we model today?
