A further issue I have is that it presumes the QEMU configuration is
fully captured by the command line. We have a long term design goal
in QEMU to get away from specifying configuration on the command
line, and move entirely to configuring QEMU via a series of QMP
commands.

This proposed command is introducing the concept of command line argv
as a formal part of the QEMU API and IMHO that is undesirable. Even
today we have backend configuration steps only done via QMP, and I'm
wondering how it would fit in with how mgmt apps currently doing live
migration.

The flipside, however, is that localhost migration via 2 separate QEMU
processes has issues where both QEMUs want to be opening the very same
file, and only 1 of them can ever have them open.


With regards,
Daniel
