Combined with the option called partinioned=false that's quite unfriendly 
for users trying to type a command line. Maybe not many do but those who 
don't also don't care about what are the defaults or if it's called mbr or 
partitioned as whatever generates the command line for them takes care 
of that. So I'm still for user friendly CLI but I also don't care enough 
to insist more if others don't think it's worth to keep this user friendly 
for command line users.

There was another question if the fat-size option is really needed or it 
could just use size if the default format=raw was changed to behave like 
format=vvfat if file=fat: is given which I think would make more sense 
than only truncating the underlying raw format that's not even needed to 
be there but I don't know how difficult it is to implement this or the 
default format=raw is hard coded and hard to change for fat: protocol.

So in summary:

1. format=vvfat,size=xMB was said to work so could file=fat:/dir,size=xMB 
imply format=vvfat so it would also work? Then no other size option is 
needed.

2. Having different defaults for floppy or disk would keep existing 
command lines working. Otherwise why not make partitioned=false the 
default and let users who need it set explicitly. That would also work for 
most cases without having to type out this option.
