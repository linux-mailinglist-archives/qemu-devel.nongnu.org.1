During 4.). The expensive vhost bring-up (e.g. for vhost-vDPA) happens 
during vhost_dev_start when it has to send ioctls to configure the 
memory table, VQs, etc.

This prep work depends on negotiated features, device configuration 
(MAC, MTU, MQ), VQ layouts (vring addresses), memory table, etc. It 
doesn't require dynamic VQ state like ring indices.

Got it. This is something I will look into then for this kind of
