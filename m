QEMU needs to know if it runs on Intel or AMD machine in order to choose=20
which set of MSR it must read. I did not check how to achieve this at the=
=20
moment but I will when I will work on that.

If one vCPU is moving socket during the sample period then it is=20
detected and not taken into account.

That said, if your system is bouncing vCPU back and forth between socket=20
then you will experience a lot of caches misses, cpu caches trashes,=20
context switches, increase of memory latency (numa issues), etc. This=20
will lead to performance degradation and VM performance being very poor.=20
Then you should probably fix it.=20

I totally understand that I can add more clarification in the=20
documentation that might be obvious for some but not for other. Like=20
isolating your VM properly will give better result.=20

But I won't give any number. It doesn't make sens. Accuracy is not the=20
goal of this feature, it never was and it never will. First of all=20
because RAPL is not accurate for power monitoring. You want accuracy?=20
Use a Power Metering device.=20
You want a reproducible way to compare power energy between=20
A and B in order to optimize your software ? Use can use RAPL and so=20
this feature that shows good reproducible results.

Got it. More documentation, use case, examples.=20
I will see what can be added to QEMU documentation.
