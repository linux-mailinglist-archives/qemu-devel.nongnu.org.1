I don't like the heuristics we currently have, and would to have
a better solution. What makes me cautious is that this proposal
is a protocol change, but only addressing one very narrow problem
with the migration protocol.

I'd like migration to see a more explicit bi-directional protocol
negotiation message set, where both QEMU can auto-negotiate amongst
themselves many of the features that currently require tedious
manual configuration by mgmt apps via migrate parameters/capabilities.
That would address the problem you describe here, and so much more.

If we add this channel header feature now, it creates yet another
thing to keep around for back compatibility. So if this is not
strictly required, in order to solve the VFIO VMstate problem, I'd
prefer to just solve the VMstate stuff on its own.

Hmm, can you clarify. /when/ is the VFIO vmstate transfer taking
place ? Is is transferred concurrently with the RAM ? I had thought
this series still has the RAM transfer iterations running first,
and then the VFIO VMstate at the end, simply making use of multifd
channels for parallelism of the end phase. your reply though makes
me question my interpretation though.

Let me try to illustrate channel flow in various scenarios, time
flowing left to right:

1. serialized RAM, then serialized VM state  (ie historical migration)

      main: | Init | RAM iter 1 | RAM iter 2 | ... | RAM iter N | VM State |


2. parallel RAM, then serialized VM state (ie today's multifd)

      main: | Init |                                            | VM state |
  multifd1:        | RAM iter 1 | RAM iter 2 | ... | RAM iter N |
  multifd2:        | RAM iter 1 | RAM iter 2 | ... | RAM iter N |
  multifd3:        | RAM iter 1 | RAM iter 2 | ... | RAM iter N |


3. parallel RAM, then parallel VM state

      main: | Init |                                            | VM state |
  multifd1:        | RAM iter 1 | RAM iter 2 | ... | RAM iter N |
  multifd2:        | RAM iter 1 | RAM iter 2 | ... | RAM iter N |
  multifd3:        | RAM iter 1 | RAM iter 2 | ... | RAM iter N |
  multifd4:                                                     | VFIO VM state |
  multifd5:                                                     | VFIO VM state |


4. parallel RAM and VFIO VM state, then remaining VM state

      main: | Init |                                            | VM state |
  multifd1:        | RAM iter 1 | RAM iter 2 | ... | RAM iter N |
  multifd2:        | RAM iter 1 | RAM iter 2 | ... | RAM iter N |
  multifd3:        | RAM iter 1 | RAM iter 2 | ... | RAM iter N |
  multifd4:        | VFIO VM state                                         |
  multifd5:        | VFIO VM state                                         |


I thought this series was implementing approx (3), but are you actually
implementing (4), or something else entirely ?


With regards,
Daniel
