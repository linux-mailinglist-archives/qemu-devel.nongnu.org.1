I've requested a CVE from Red Hat, and hope to have an assigned number
soon.  Meanwhile, we can get review started, to make sure this is
ready to include in 9.1.  'qemu-img info' should never print untrusted
data in a way that might take over a user's terminal.

There are probably other spots where qemu-img info is printing
untrusted data (such as filenames), where we probably ought to use the
same sanitization tactics as shown here.  Identifying those spots
would be a useful part of this review, and may mean a v2 that is even
more extensive in the number of patches.

In patch 1, I created mod_utf8_sanitize_len(), with the intent that I
could sanitize just a prefix of a string without having to copy it
into a NUL-terminated buffer.  I didn't end up needing it in my
current version of patch 2 (since the code was already copying to a
NUL-terminated buffer for trace purposes), but we may find uses for
it; in fact, it raises the question of whether any of our trace_ calls
need to sanitize untrusted data (or whether we can rely on ALL trace
engines to be doing that on our behalf, already).
