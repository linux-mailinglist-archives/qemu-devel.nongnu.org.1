For classes that are actually used that may be true but this class isn't 
used anywhere just defined for the user to be instantiated from command 
line or config. So you won't even need a type name in code currently. It's 
also an internal part of ICH southbridge so no need to be exposed outside 
of that as it's only useful within that chip. Finally it has no 
functionality, just an empty boilerplate so that the device appears in 
lspci output but it does nothing. Therefore, I think it's simpler to just 
move all of it within the same file where the southbridge is implemented 
and define as empty object there like the via-mc97 device in 
hw/audio/via-ac97.c which serves the same purpose to show the part to the 
guest but its empty device without function. That would save half of all 
this boilerplate that just adds complexity now. If sometimes in the future 
this device gains some functionality then it can be split off and add all 
the defines and stuff around it but that's not needed yet so why not keep 
it simple?
