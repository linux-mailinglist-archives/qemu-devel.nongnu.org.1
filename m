We don't record the 'why' I'm afraid, so answer the 'why' is pretty
much a case of having to read the code :-(

The list of probes is also somewhat metadata driven, starting
from:

 https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/blob/6ff8d08777ebbcb9a1e11534c3a3341fbf0343e8/src/qemu/qemu_capabilities.c?page=6#L5718

you would have to then work backwards for each virQMEUCapsProbeQMP
method we call.

With regards,
Daniel
