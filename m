Sorry about the confusion, but tftp does go through the bridge after
all: vhost-user-bridge logs TX but not RX, so when I didn't see the data
in the log, I thought that meant the tftp feature of the user-mode
backend achieved transfer via some shortcut.
In fact, when the guest connects to an http server on the host, the
request is also logged and the data is not, like tftp, but I must have
mistaken seeing the data with the http transfer (probably when going the
other direction where host downloads from guest), hence the wrong
shortcut assumption.
Anyway, I've added an RX iov_hexdump to vhost-user-bridge.c and all is
visible now.

Yodel
