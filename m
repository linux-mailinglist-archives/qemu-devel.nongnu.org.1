Ahh I see - I'd only seen this thread continue so wasn't aware a new
version had been posted. For future patches consider using -vN when
sending them so we can clearly see a new revision is available.

I can see patch 1/2 has been queued and 2/2 is still outstanding. I'm
having trouble finding the referenced entry in the OHCI spec. The only
one I can see is Release 1.1, January 6th, 2000 and that doesn't have a
section 4.3.1.2.

I think discussion should continue on that thread.
