To be clear, I'm not arguing against cancel. I'm just pointing out that
it's silly because it's just like pressing C-c in the shell in the
middle of something. What's the expected end state? Completely
unspecified. I don't find it at all "elegant" that we treat cancel like
error and just let the code carry on stumbling and exit
eventually. Because then we have this C-c arriving at random moments in
the middle of stuff. The way we do "exiting" in multifd is way more
maintainable. If that flag is set, then let's exit, otherwise everything
should work.

Note that in some parts of this series I'm checking the CANCELLING
state, which aside from being prone to be racy, is a step in a different
direction than the way we've implemented cancel so far (shutdown and let
the code exit vs. explicitly check against the CANCELLING state).

Hope I'm being coherent, I'm not sure.

Some of these words could be in the documentation for cancel to make it
clear what the expectations are.

Which kind of implies we should test this by migrate->cancel->migrate,
like the multifd test does, and not like this series does. I've been
focusing more on catching crashes/hangs.

I asked because for socket at least yank and cancel do the same:
shutdown(). It might be more trouble than it's worth it, but I wonder if
we could have everything that can be stuck implement a yank routine and
just have cancel call those. So for instance, when this series does
sem_post on a bunch of semaphores explicitly, the cancel command would
instead call whatever yank routine was registered by the code that can
wait on the semaphore. With this there should be no surprises of a
cancel arriving at a weird moment, because we'd require "code that
sleeps" to implement a yank.

For migration specifically I don't see much difference. Yank must leave
QEMU in a usable state enough for a second migration to succeed,
otherwise it's useless.
