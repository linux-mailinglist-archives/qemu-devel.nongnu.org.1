I think it also makes sense from the userspace POV; it is a common truth 
that atomic memory operations are cheaper than system calls.

Eliminating spurious wakeups requires removing the paragraph from the 
man page and updating all libraries (including libpthread) not to make 
spurious wakeups, which takes a long time. We need to prepare for 
spurious wakeups for now.

I agree the man page can be clearer; the paragraph assumes readers 
naively follow what it says, but you need more insights; I also had to 
spend some time to understand the QemuEvent code and the libpthread 
code, which was unnecessary if the man page describes "the common futex 
usage pattern".

We need to care external libraries that may use futex and at least I 
know libpthread can cause spurious wakeups.
