The diffstat doesn't really help here. The full code is:

    /* zero means OSPM does not acknowledge the error */
    if (!read_ack) {
        error_setg(errp,
                   "Last CPER record was not acknowledged yet");
        read_ack = 1;
        cpu_physical_memory_write(read_ack_start_addr,
                                  &read_ack, sizeof(read_ack));
        return;
    }

The above code is actually an error handling condition: if for some
reason errors are triggered too fast, there's a bug on QEMU or there is
a bug at the OSPM, an error message is raised and the logic resets the 
record to a sane state. So, on a next error, OSPM will get it.

As described at https://uefi.org/specs/ACPI/6.5/18_Platform_Error_Interfaces.html?highlight=asynchronous#generic-hardware-error-source:

   "Some platforms may describe multiple Generic Hardware Error Source
    structures with different notification types, as defined in 
    Table 18.10. For example, a platform may describe one error source
    for the handling of synchronous errors (e.g. MCE or SEA), and a 
    second source for handling asynchronous errors (e.g. SCI or
    External Interrupt)."

Basically, the error logic there seems to fit for the asynchronous
case, detecting if another error happened before OSPM handles the
first one.

IMO, there are a couple of alternatives to handle such case:

1. Keep the code as-is: if this ever happens, an error message will
   be issued. If SEA/MCE gets implemented synchronously on HW/FW/OSPM,
   the above code will never be called;
2. Change the logic to do that only for asynchronous sources
   (currently, only if source ID is QMP);
3. Add a special QMP message to reset the notification ack. Probably
   would use Notification type as an input parameter;
4. Have a much more complex code to implement asynchronous notifications,
   with a queue to receive HEST errors and a separate thread to deliver
   errors to OSPM asynchronously. If we go this way, QMP would be
   returning the number of error messages queued, allowing error injection
   code to know if OSPM has troubles delivering errors;
5. Just return an error code without doing any resets. To me, this is 
   the worse scenario.

I don't like (5), as if something bad happens, there's nothing to be
done.

For QMP error injection (4) seems is overkill. It may be needed in the
future if we end implementing a logic where host OS informs guest about
hardware problems, and such errors use asynchronous notifications.

I would also avoid implementing (3) at least for now, as reporting
such error via QMP seems enough for the QMP usecase.

So, if ok for you, I'll change the code to (2).
