Hi Dmitry,
Welcome back! The struct virtio_blk_outhdr 32-bit ioprio field is
currently ignored by many device implementations. Is I/O priority
directly related to cache behavior? If yes, your virtio-blk device
implementation could interpret this field. If not, then it's probably
better to add a separate field.

It would be technically possible to add a virtio-blk feature bit for
per-request metadata. Plumbing this new metadata through the stack
requires changes to multiple software components though and might be the
reason why something like this does not exist.

virtio-blk generally sticks to the generic block device model that the
Linux kernel block layer implements. If the Linux block layer doesn't
have the cache metadata concept, then it may require some convincing of
the VIRTIO and Linux communities to add this new concept. Is the concept
of cache metadata (separate from I/O priority in Linux) a thing?

If you can show examples from other storage protocols like NVMe or SCSI,
then that would help in designing a virtio-blk solution too.

Stefan
