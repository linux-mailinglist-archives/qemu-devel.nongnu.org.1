Hi Ani,

Don't get me wrong, I really like the general idea of vmfwupdate as
a way to implement BYOFW, and for non-confidential VMs it is great. I
just think the interface design is not well suited for confidential VMs
yet and want to discuss how to change that.

There is at least one Hyperscaler which uses IGVM, another implemented
support for it in their hypervisor (although not for a BYOFW feature,
yet). In my view this problem is still widely being worked on today by
the CSPs. If you are lucky, and since the firmware is provided by the
CSP as well, they publish expected launch measurments for each of their
coco platforms.

Without a way to supply user-defined setup steps of a confidential VM
the host-VMM has to hardcode them. And that hardcoded behavior becomes
ABI implicitly, because any change to this behavior will also change the
actual launch measurements, potentially breaking existing users.

This happened in the past already when KVM decided to hardcode a
different set of SEV-Features by enabling Debug-Swap. I strongly believe
that with KVM/QEMU we should work in a direction which makes those
breakages unlikely in the future.

Regards,

	Joerg
