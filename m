The fact that the device is something emulated and not the Intel
hardware device is actually visible to the guest:

00:02.0 System peripheral: Intel Corporation 6300ESB Watchdog Timer
	Subsystem: Red Hat, Inc. QEMU Virtual Machine
	Flags: fast devsel
	Memory at 10804000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=3D16]
	Kernel driver in use: i6300ESB timer
	Kernel modules: i6300esb

(lspci -v so unfortunately not immediately obvious, but still)

AFAIK the BSDs do not have a driver for this device at the moment -- and
given what turns up when searching for i6300ESB, someone implementing a
driver is far more likely to pick the exising PCI ID.

Windows would also need some dance according to Yan's mail, for unclear
benefits.

On the whole, I think this is not really worth the hassle, we can simply
keep this device as-is.
