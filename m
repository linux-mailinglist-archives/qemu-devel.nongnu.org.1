Each of the tests in migration-test  were added for a good reason,
generally to address testing gaps where we had functional regressions
in the past. I don't think its a good idea to stop running such tests
in CI as gating on new contributions. Any time we've had optional
tests in QEMU, we've seen repeated regressions in the area in question.

Test reliability is a different thing. If a particular test is
flaky, it needs to either be fixed or disabled. Splitting into
a fast & slow grouping doesn't address reliability, just hides
the problem from view.

Again, the tests all exist because migration code is incredibly
complicated, with a lot of permutations, with a history of being
very bug / regression prone. With that in mind, it is unavoidable
that we're going to have a significant testing overhead for
migration code.

Looking at its execution time right now, I'd say migration test
is pretty good, considering the permutations we have to target.

It gets a bad reputation because historically it has been as
much as x20 slower than it is today, and has also struggled
with reliability. The latter is a reflection of the complexity
of migration and and IMHO actually justifies greater testing,
as long as we put in time to address bugs.

Also we've got one single test program, covering an entire
subsystem in one go, rather than lots of short individual
test programs, so migration unfairly gets blamed for being
slow, when it simply covers alot of functionality in one
program.

In general, I think it is unreasonable for other maintainers to
tell us to stop adding test coverage for migration, and would
push back against such a request. 

We should, however, continue to optimize how we add further test
coverage, where practical, overload testing of multiple features
onto a single test case helps.

We've already massively optimized the migration-test compared to
its historical behaviour.

A potentially bigger win could be seen if we change how we exercise
the migration functionality. Since we had the migration qtest that
runs a full migration operation, we've tended to expand testing by
adding new qtest functions. ie we've added a functional test for
everything we want covered. This is nice & simple, but also expensive.
We've ignored unit testing, which I think is a mistake.

Individually none of those is very slow on its own - 10 are in
the 2-3 second range,  35 are 1-2 secs,  and 6 are less than
1 second.

A very large portion of those are validating different ways to
establish migration. Hardly any of them actually need to run
a migration to completion. Even without running to completion
though, we have the overheads of spawning 2 QEMUs.

This feels like something that should be amenable to unit testing.
Might need a little re-factoring of migration code to make it
easier to run a subset of its logic in isolation, but that'd
probably be a win anyway, as such work usually makes code cleaner.

In terms of running time, I think migration-test is acceptable as it is
to run in 'make check' by default and doesn't justify dropping test
coverage. We should still look to optimize & move to unit testing more
code, and any reliability issues are something that needs to be addressed
too.

Daniel
