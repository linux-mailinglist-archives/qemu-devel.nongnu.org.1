No rush.  I am not sure whether it'll reduce downtime, but it may improve
total migration time when multiple devices are used.

Yes it makes sense.  It'll be good to look one step further in this case,
then:

  - If it's easy to add support then we do in one batch, or

  - If it's not easy to add support, but if we can find a compatible way so
    that ABI can be transparent when adding that later, it'll be also nice, or
    
  - If we have solid clue it should be a major separate work, and we must
    need a new flag, then we at least know we should simply split the
    effort due to that complexity

The hope is option (1)/(2) would work out.

I hope Avihai can also chim in here (or please reach him out) because I
remember he used to consider proposing such a whole solution, but maybe I
just misunderstood.  I suppose no harm to check with him.

Thanks,
