Sorry for the confused wording. It is true that the backend does not
do the mmap, but requests it to be done. One point of confusion for
me from your sentence is that I refer to the driver as the frontend,
and the mapping is done by the VMM (i.e., QEMU).

But yeah, I agree and the scenario you describe is what
I had in mind. Thanks for pointing it out. I will rephrase it
in follow-up patches.

&gt; Hi all,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; This is an early attempt to have backends<br>
&gt; support dynamic fd mapping into shared<br>
&gt; memory regions. As such, there are a few<br>
&gt; things that need settling, so I wanted to<br>
&gt; post this first to have some early feedback.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The usecase for this is, e.g., to support<br>
&gt; vhost-user-gpu RESOURCE_BLOB operations,<br>
&gt; or DAX Window request for virtio-fs. In<br>
&gt; general, any operation where a backend<br>
&gt; would need to mmap an fd to a shared<br>
&gt; memory so that the guest can access it.<br>
<br>
I wanted to mention that this sentence confuses me because:<br>
<br>
- The frontend will mmap an fd into the guest&#39;s memory space so that a<=
