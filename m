Yes.

SMMUv3 is a platform device and its placement in a system is typically as b=
elow
for PCI devices,

This patch is attempting to establish that association between the PCIe RC =
and=20
the SMMUv3 device so that Qemu can build the ACPI tables/DT iommu mappings =

for the SMMUv3 device.

The whole idea of reusing the "bus" property for SMMUv3 device was to make
it easier for libvirt. As I mentioned earlier we could go back and use a di=
fferent
property name like "primary-bus" or "pci-bus" for SMMUv3 dev here.
