IIUC that's not required for migration then, because migration should know
exactly how much data to receive, and migration should need to verify that
and fail if the received data didn't match the expectation along the way.
We also have QEMU_VM_EOF as the end mark of stream.

Said that, are we sure any pre-mature termination will only happen after
all data read in the receive buffer that was sent?

To ask in another way: what happens if the source QEMU sends everything and
shutdown()/close() the channel, meanwhile the dest QEMU sees both (1) rest
data to read, and (2) a pre-mature terminatino of TLS session in a read()
syscall.  Would (2) be reported even before (1), or the order guaranteed
that read of the residue data in (1) always happen before (2) (considering
dest QEMU can be slow sometime on consuming the network buffers)?

Thanks,
