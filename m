Hmmm good question. In theory we're interested only in implementing the rvsp-ref
spec but adding virt-io support doesn't hurt the spec implementation in any
way ... I think. Drew, any comments?

This series has been stale because, as you might've read in the thread, it turns
out we're missing a mandatory extension (sdext).

I get emails from time to time from people asking about the status of this work
so I'm considering pushing the patches as is, without sdext, and add documentation
saying that this isn't a 100% rsvp-ref compliant board. The absence of sdext
seems tolerable for the current uses ppl have for the board ATM, so upstreaming
it as is can be beneficial for everyone. We can add sdext support later and
then update the docs claiming 100% compliance.

At very least I'll have to send a v4 now that you pointed out a wrong memory
address in the memmap, so I'll start with that.


Thanks,

Daniel
