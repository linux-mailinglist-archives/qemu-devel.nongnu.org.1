Yeah, it's something we can sweep under the rug unless/until someone
wants to disable these things.

It won't be a new node property, it'll just be negated properties - eg
riscv,isa-extensions =3D ..., "no-zicclsm";
That's what I mean when I say that these will not be able to be treated
in the same way as any other extension, but it only applies iff someone
wants to disable them. This isn't just a QEMU problem, but QEMU is the
bleeding edge of "hardware" support, so it's cropping up here first (or
maybe only :))

Until someone wants to turn them off, you can avoid doing anything
differently, just like this amazing ascii art I found:

                _,-\/-,_
                \      /
                 \_.._/
               _,/    \,_
              / \      / \
             ,\  )    (  /,
             (__/ .''. \__)
                \,_||   /
                |  ||\ |
                | /|| \|
                () || ()
                // || ||
               //  || ||
              //   || ||
             //    || /\
 -- '' -'-' ^^'    )( '^^-- '' -'-'   miK
                  (=3D=3D)
                   `~`

Hopefully posting ostriches on the QEMU list isn't grounds for a ban,
Conor.
