I'm surprised that the UEFI payload (?) on *physical* loongarch machines
is supposed (?) to launch from ROM. That means "no firmware updates",
which is quite unusual nowadays. Recent versions of the UEFI spec have
introduced a bunch of interfaces just for standardizing firmware
updates, meaning both add-on card firmware, and platform/system firmware.

(Unfortunately, I have nothing "constructive" to add; apologies.)
