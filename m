It's never about when mgmt is an app like libvirt, IMHO either way we
define it, libvirt will be fine.  It's only about human beings when using
this API e.g. via HMPs, or who start to write scripts manipulating QEMU
directly assuming the max-bw will persist.

That's almost why I thought remembering the globals should be the best
because it will work well for both a computer and a human being.  But I
might be the only one thinking so if you don't agree on this; it's fine.

Frankly, I never thought there was an real problem to solve..  the only
thing I can remember is that "libvirt used to control this qemu, but link
down, some admin set something, libvirt reconnected and migration caused
weird issues".

IMHO when reconnect libvirt can always apply all the parameters once
more.. then if link kept, globals are also kept for this session anyway.
IMHO it's fair here because migration is special and unique for a QEMU
instance.  I don't further worry on other weird setups, like QEMU exposing
two QMP monitors - libvirt started the QEMU instance after all.

I almost always thought having "config" in migrate QMP command is a bonus
and optional, since it's still easy to get.  Hence, there's no harm anyway
we support it.  Your other changes (dedup >1 migration parameters structs,
merging caps into parameters, etc.) are more solid changers to me.

I'd confess initially I didn't expect so - logically we can introduce one
or a few new cases to test "config" setups, because most of the code paths
should really be shared (unless we decide to obsolete set-parameters; I
guess we won't.. forever).  But since we moved this far, The test cases are
now also moving all towards configs after this series. I think it's fine,
and you can decide that.

Yes, actually I won't be surprised that after your series lands maybe the
"config" in QMP_MIGRATE won't be used for a while.  And if it keeps going
like that, nobody will consume it.. but I don't really know.  We'll see!

What I know is, after your series lands, I'll start to play with changing
default values for capabilities. :)
