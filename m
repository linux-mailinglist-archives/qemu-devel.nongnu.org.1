Running inside a container does protect the host to a significant
degree. I'd say it is still important, however, to protect the
control plane (libvirt's daemons & kubevirt's agent) from the QEMU
process being managed, and in that case it still looks pretty
compelling to deny exec.

Both approaches have significant challenges for integration, but my general
preference is towards a solution that doesn't require undermining our security
protections.

When starting a VM we have no knowledge of whether a user may want to use
CPR at a later date. We're not going to disable the seccomp sandbox by
default, so that means cpr-exec would not be viable in a default VM
deployment.

Admins could choose to modify /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf to turn off seccomp,
but I'm very much not in favour of introducing a feature that requires
them todo this. It would be a first in libvirt, as everything else we
support is possible to use with seccomp enabled. The seccomp opt-out is
essentially just there as an emergency escape hatch, not as something we
want used in production.

Considering the end result, are there CPR usage scenarios that are possible
with cpr-exec, that can't be achieved with cpr-transfer ?

Supporting two ways to doing the same thing is increasing the maint burden
for QEMU maintainers, as well as downstream testing engineers who have to
validate this functionality. So unless there's compelling need to support
both cpr-transfer and cpr-exec, it'd be nice to standardize on just one of
them.

cpr-transfer does look like its probably more viable, even with its own
challenges wrt resources being opened twice.

With regards,
Daniel
