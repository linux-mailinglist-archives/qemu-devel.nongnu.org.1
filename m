The section says:

MaxIntrs > 1 in our case so Interrupter Mapping is supported. It is 
irrelevant whether MSI(-X) is enabled.

This statement contains a phrase "its associated Event Ring contains 
Event TRBs that require an interrupt". A preceding statement says:
 > Each Interrupter consists of an Interrupter Management Register, an
 > Interrupter Moderation Register and an Event Ring.

So Event Rings are associated with interrupters and "its" should mean 
"the Interrupter's". It is also strange to say "require an interrupt" if 
"its" refers to an interrupt; it should just say "require it".

It is very awkward if "it" and "its" in one statement refer to different 
things so I think it's safe to assume "it" refers to an Interrupter here.

This section is to describe Interrupters after all. Considering the 
context, a natural interpretation would be to assume "it" or "its" refer 
to an Interrupter.

The associated Event Ring may still contain Event TRBs, but they will 
not assert interrupts:

That's unfortunate but the higher complexity seems inevitable.

The proposed behavior is not a natural interpretation of the 
specification and requires an alternative interpretation very favorable 
for macOS. If I am to choose either of adopting an unnatural behavior 
for all or complicating one platform, I'll choose the latter.
