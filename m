Thanks for looking into this! I'd guessed it was something to do with 
JIT, makes sense.

Yeah, the situation with KVM is slightly better, although it's still a 
~200MiB overhead with default Q35 and no extra devices (I haven't 
measured the difference with various devices).

I think it's definitely nice to have an on-fault option for this, as 
optimizing every possible mmap caller for the rare mem-lock=on case 
might be too ambitious.

Thanks!
