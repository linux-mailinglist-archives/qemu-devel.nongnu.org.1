I just realized I dropped this on the floor.  I apologize for the delay.

Yes, there's inconsistency, but is it worth cleaning up?  Since you did
the work already, and sunk cost doesn't count, ...

Good, as "QMP registry" is a more accurate description than "QMP
dispatch".

Only necessary to let you split the patch updating #include directives.
The update is entirely mechanical, isn't it?  I doubt splitting is worth
the trouble then.

qapi/qerror.h works for me.

Could use the opportunity to rename it to qapi/deprecated-qerror.h.
