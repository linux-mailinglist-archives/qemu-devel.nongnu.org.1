...except that custom structures/formats in command line args is
something we've tried very hard to eliminate in Qemu, and instead
model everything as a distinct fields, using QAPI, so...

.. if you're meaning "arm:raspi" as a short hand for "target:machine"
   that would be a design anti-pattern, b

...if you're meaning that "arm:raspi" is the full machine name, to be
   strictly treated as an opaque string that would be acceptable.

I rather think the latter would not end up being treated as an opaque
string though - the tempetation to parse it & assign semantics to the
pieces is just too great. So I'm not a fan of that approach.

From a QAPI design best pratice POV, the requirement would be for

 -machine target=arm,name=raspi

Daniel
