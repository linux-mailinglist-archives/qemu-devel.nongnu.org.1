I did a rework of the patch -- see my email from May 20, quoted below --
and I was under the impression it addressed all the review comments. Did I
miss something? I apologize if I did.

real HW behaves but I may well have missed it.

This is what I wrote regarding real HW:

Results are:

 qemu 4.2   | qemu HEAD  | actual HW
------------+------------+------------
 works fine | ohci_die() | works fine

Would additional verification of the actual HW be useful?

Peter posted the following which is more specific than "qemu 4.2" -- I
agree this is most likely the qemu commit where this thread is focused:

> Almost certainly this was commit 1328fe0c32d54 ("hw: usb: hcd-ohci:

Where does the conversation go from here? I'm under the impression I have
provided objective answers to all the questions and resolved all review
comments on the code. I receive the feedback that I missed something -
please restate the question?
