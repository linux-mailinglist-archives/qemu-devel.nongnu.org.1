I think it would still be easy to add "cap" & "params" arguments support
for the "migrate" QMP command without breaking the current API, iff that
helps in whatever form.  When present, it simply applies the caps and/or
param list first before invoking the migrate command, fail the command if
cap / param check fails.

But I'm not sure whether that's a concern at all for Libvirt, if what
Libvirt currently does is having separate "migrate-set-*" commands prior to
the "migrate".  I may have overlooked the real issue behind on how that
could complicate Libvirt.

I assume it implies the join() path as a start.  As long as we're ok we
risk slow quits of QEMU, as I would expect bug reports coming afterwards,
we could try.  I believe there's no way we can resolve all such issues in
one shot.  I doubt whether some of those can be too tricky so we may wish
to go back at some point, spending too much effort but without a direct
benefit yet so far.

Meanwhile we still have the immediate concern that current_migration can
points to freed memory right now with QEMU master branch.  That's simply
wrong.

I thought it was still an improvement to have the singleton idea, so that
even afterwards we can join() properly the idea may still make sense on its
own.  It is also not against the ultimate willingness that we want to
create an obj at start of migration, and clearly destroys it after
migration completes.  When that comes we keep migration object singleton,
but then the tricky operations on current_migration can be gone.

That still guarantees from QOM level that e.g. nobody tries to initiate
migration twice, for example, or accidentally create it somewhere, like in
qom-list-properties.

There's yet another short term plan that I can fix UAF for
current_migration, which is to have a refcount for migration alone on top
of Object, then it only object_unref() on the migration object after we
know the last real refcount is released.  That won't need any QOM change,
so keep the complexity internally.  But I prefer the current proposal,
assuming it could be still helpful in general for QEMU, even though I'm not
sure.

So.. I'm not sure whether we should ignore the current UAF until a whole
refactor of any kind to land, or we should do something to fix it, which is
what I'm trying with the series.

Thanks,
