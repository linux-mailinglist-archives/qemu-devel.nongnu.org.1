I'm not sure I follow your argument.  Glib holds a reference on the
GSource object, not on the opaque data that is handed to the GSource.
It is possible to use g_source_set_callback_indirect() where GSource
can learn how to use the same reference counting on data as external
code, by the use of function pointers for ref and unref, but QIO uses
merely g_source_set_callback().
https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/main/glib/gmain.c#L1844
shows that glib then wraps that opaque pointer into an internal
GSourceCallback object which itself is reference counted, so that the
notify function is not called until the GSource is finalized, but that
is reference counting on the container, not on the opaque object
itself (which in this patch is the QIONetListener).

So if I'm understanding your concern, you're worried that the unwatch
code can finish looping through the g_source_destroy and then reach
the point where it unrefs listener, but that a late-breaking client
connection can trigger a callback that can still be executing in
another thread/coroutine after the listener is unref'ed but before the
GSource has been finalized?  If so, would squashing this in fix the
problem you are seeing?
