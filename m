My reason for four spaces is reducing churn.  To see by how much, I
redid your change.  I found a few more notes that don't start with a
capital letter, or don't end with a period.

Anyway, your diffstat:

 30 files changed, 266 insertions(+), 255 deletions(-)

Mine:

 30 files changed, 134 insertions(+), 119 deletions(-)

A fair bit easier to review.

Permit me a digression...

We have rST in comments.

Python has rST in doc strings.

JSON has neither comments nor doc strings, but since we use it just for
the file name extension, that's irrelevant.

Could Emacs help us more if we used Pythony doc strings instead of
comments?

End of digression.

Valid point.

If we decide to tweak indentation, we should do so in a separate patch
that does absolutely nothing but tweak indentation.
