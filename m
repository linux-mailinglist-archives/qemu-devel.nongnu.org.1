I think the paragraph's purpose is to clarify "preferred format" is what
developers want to work with going forward even when the initial
contribution started with generated contents.

I think the "deterministic process" clause distracts from this.
Moreover, it feels largely redundant with the next patch's "Use of AI
content generators".  Scratch the clause?

  Such tools are acceptable to use, provided and there is clearly defined
  copyright and licensing for their output.
