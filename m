My thought is that the initial merge focuses only on the build system
integration. So that's basically patches 1 + 2 in this series.

IMHO that is small enough that we should be able to demonstrate that
we detect Rust, run bindgen & compile its result, on all our supported
platforms without an unreasonable amount of effort.

Patch 3, the high level APIs is where I see most of the work and
collaboration being needed, but that doesn't need to be rushed into
the first merge. We would have a "rust" subsystem + maintainer who
would presumably have a staging tree, etc in the normal way we work
and collaborate

With regards,
Daniel
