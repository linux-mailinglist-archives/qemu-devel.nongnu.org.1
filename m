The only parts of this work that are specific to exec are these patches
and the qemu_clear_cloexec() calls in cpr.c.
   vl: helper to request re-exec
   migration: precreate vmstate for exec

The rest would be the same if some other mechanism were used to start
new qemu.   Additional code would be needed for the new mechanism, such
as SCM_RIGHTS sends.

100 ms is not a promise, it is an order-of-magnitude characterization. A typical
result.

Agreed.  The key metric is guest blackout time.  In fact, the 100 ms I quote
is blackout time, not elapsed time, though the latter is not much longer.

Exec is not a key requirement, but it works well.  Please give it fair
consideration.

Apps may be OK with it, but I offer a better experience.
To be clear, chardev preservation is a nice feature that is easy to implement
with the cpr-exec framework, but is not the primary motivation for my work.

You need much of the cpr-exec (or cpr-scm) framework to support it:
a mechanism to preserve the open descriptor, and precreate vmstate to
identify the descriptor for new qemu.

Fork is scarier; it preserves almost everything, with a few exceptions.
Exec destroys almost everything, with a few exceptions.
Please give it a chance.  The theorized cpr-scm would no doubt be useful
for some cloud vendors, but so is cpr-exec.  cpr-scm is intellectually
interesting to me, and I might work on it at some point, but cpr-exec is
what I need for our cloud.

Try these tracepoints:
-trace enable=qemu_anon_memfd_alloc
-trace enable=ram_block_create
-trace enable='*factory*'
-trace enable='vmstate_*register'

I sent this to Peter already, but for others benefit, this series applies to
commit 5da72194df36535d77.
