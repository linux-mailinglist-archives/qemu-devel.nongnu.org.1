The comment in tests/functional/meson.build is a special case rule
that isn't building anything. Rather that precache logic is using a
custom target to download several GB of disk images needed by tests,
such that the tests themselves won't hit a timeout downloading images
on first run. That use of  "build_by_default: false" would be fine.

AFAICT, it shouldn't be more complex than anything else we're doing
with meson option handling. eg instead of hardcoding 'false', do
something like:

  build_by_default: get_option('tests')

where the option defaults to 'true'.

FWIW, I would really strongly suggest to *always* run QEMU's tests
from release tarball, and most especially for distro packaging.
There are just way too many moving parts in our 3rd party deps to
be confident everything in QEMU works correctly without having run
the tests.

When we still used automake in libvirt, we overrode that behaviuor to
always build tests, as it was causing too frequent problems with
contributors overlooking that a patch had broken test compile.

With regards,
Daniel
