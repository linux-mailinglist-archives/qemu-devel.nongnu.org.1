Yeah, it always was for me - thanks for confirming.

Which is odd as it should only add a warning right?
But I checked the logs - the build on "e68ec29809 i386/cpu: Move
adjustment of CPUID_EXT_PDCM before feature_dependencies[] check"
passed the same use case.
I'll build both outside of the bisect run tomorrow to ensure this is
reproducible when I watch it more closely (than submitting a bisect
script).
Maybe this already helps to put your eyes and thoughts in the right directi=
on.
