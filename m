Hmm. Probably not. If we have 2 virtqueue, seems good to see both event
(or only one, if only one virtqueue failed).
If we have 256 virtqueues, 256 immediate events seems too much.
So, better is to drop virtqueue here and consider only qom-path for throttling.

Oh. that's a good shot.

I'm afraid it can't. And this makes me to dig into history of this patch
- no, we didn't discussed it before.

And before trying to implement something new here (a way to get a kind of
virtqueues status by a new QMP command), I check that:
- our mgmt tool still doesn't use VIRTQUEUE_ERROR event (which we've
merged to downstream QEMU long ago, of course)
- the original problem that led us to introducing such event doesn't
bother us for a long time

It seems wiser to stop here for now. I should have considered these aspects
before beginning the process of reviving this series. Sorry for your time.

Still, if we (or someone other) need such event in future - good, we have
a modern patch in mailing list to start from.
