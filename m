Based on my work with John Snow on typing of the QAPI generator: there
is some choice.

Consider typing a function's argument.  Should we pick it based on what
the function requires from its argument?  Or should the type reflect how
the function is used?

Say the function iterates over the argument.  So we make the argument
Iterable[...], right?  But what if all callers pass a list?  Making it
List[...] could be clearer then.  It's a choice.

I think the choice depends on context and taste.  At some library's
external interface, picking a more general type can make the function
more generally useful.  But for some internal helper, I'd pick the
actual type.

My point isn't that an LLM could not possibly do the right thing based
on context, and maybe even "taste" distilled from its training data.  My
point is that this isn't entirely mechanical with basically one correct
output.

Once we have such judgement calls, there's the question how an LLM's
choice depends on its training data (first order approximation today:
nobody knows), and whether and when that makes the LLM's output a
derived work of its training data (to be settled in court).

Maybe.

Understood.  We need to develop a better understanding of capabilities,
potential benefits and risks, and such experiments can only help with
that.
