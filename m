My two cents:

We considered a possibility to switch to cpr-exec, and even more,
we thought about some kind of loading new version of QEMU binary to running
QEMU process (like library) and switching to it. But finally decided to
keep our current approach (starting new QEMU in a separate process) and
use CPR transfer (and finally come to my current in-list proposals of
just migrating all fds in main migration channel).

First, we don't run QEMU in docker, so probably we don't encounter some
problems around it. The real problem for us is migration downtime for
switching network and disk.

Still, why we don't want cpr-exec? Two reasons:

1. It seems, that current approach is more safe against different errors during
migration: we have more chances just to say "cont" on source process, if something
goes wrong.

2. It seems, that with second process we do have more possibilities to minimize
downtime, as we can do some initializations in a new QEMU process _before_ migration
(when second process starts, the first is still running).

I also thought about, could we do a kind of "exec", but still be able to avoid [2]?
This leads to an idea of loading new qemu binary to the running process (like library),
and .. start executing it in parallel with the old one? But that looks like trying
to reinvent processes again, which is obviously bad idea.
