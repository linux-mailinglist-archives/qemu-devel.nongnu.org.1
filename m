Yes, please!

We talked about the issue of stale MAINTAINERS entries before, mostly
when e-mail bounces get sufficiently annoying for somebody to submit or
ask for a MAINTAINERS correction, but as far as I know it always stopped
at talk.

Ignored e-mail is arguably worse than bouncing e-mail.  50 entries out
of 258 is a lot.

If the cleaning you propose works, we should consider repeating it
regularly, to avoid backsliding.  Annually?
