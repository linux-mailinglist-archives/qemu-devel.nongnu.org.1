By "bare metal image" I mean here guest code that is expecting
to run as if it were the only thing that ever ran on the system,
so that it starts up with the CPU coming straight out of reset.
That is, it doesn't assume that it's been started via some kind
of BIOS or bootloader that sets up registers and configures the
hardware the way Linux wants to be started.

It's in hw/arm/boot.c, in the function arm_setup_direct_kernel_boot().

You cannot -- changing this would break QEMU's compatibility
with existing user command lines which assume they can pass an
ELF file to QEMU to get the bare-metal-bootup behaviour.

Do not try to pass a Linux kernel vmlinux ELF file to -kernel:
as I have told you, this will not work. Pass instead the
corresponding Image file. That will work and does not need
any changes to QEMU itself.
