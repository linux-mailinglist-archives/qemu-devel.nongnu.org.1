Theoretically SMBIOS can still be used with isapc,
(that's how I've tested factoring out legacy part by running
RHEL6 in TCG mode)=20
Whether it's used in practice somewhere else is unknown.=20

It's question of whether we are willing to do unthinkable,
i.e. to break QEMU <-> guest ABI for isapc case by removing
corresponding fwcfg entries.

With migration ignored it shouldn't be a problem.
Question is: does anyone care about migration with isapc?
If not, I'd gladly axe smbios legacy parts in 9.1


But given how easy one can spawn old qemu environment to
run something on isapc, we are loosing a chance to cleanup
QEMU code base touching following=20

    m->option_rom_has_mr =3D true;                                         =
       =20
    m->rom_file_has_mr =3D false;                                          =
       =20
    pcmc->pci_enabled =3D false;                                           =
       =20
    pcmc->has_acpi_build =3D false;                                        =
       =20
    pcmc->smbios_defaults =3D false;                                       =
       =20
    pcmc->gigabyte_align =3D false;                                        =
       =20
    pcmc->smbios_legacy_mode =3D true;                                     =
       =20
    pcmc->has_reserved_memory =3D false;

they are all marginal but in shared code, and removing them
makes code a bit more easier to follow (especially when it
comes to memory layout).
