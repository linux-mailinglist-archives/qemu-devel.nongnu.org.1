OK, makes sense.

Then do you think it's possible to support cpr-transfer in that scenario
from Libvirt POV?

One thing I am aware of is cpr-exec is not the only one who might start to
use exec() in QEMU. TDX fundamentally will need to create another key VM to
deliver the keys and the plan seems to be using exec() too.  However in
that case per my understanding the exec() is optional - the key VM can also
be created by Libvirt.

IOW, it looks like we can still stick with execve() being blocked yet so
far except cpr-exec().

Hmm, this makes the decision harder to make.  We need to figure out a way
on knowing how to consume this feature for at least open source virt
stack..  So far it looks like it's only possible (if we take seccomp high
priority) we use cpr-transfer but only in a container.

Thanks,
