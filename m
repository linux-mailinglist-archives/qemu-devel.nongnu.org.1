Right, my point was actually vCPU objects are too heavy as the place holders. It was
reason why I had the concern: why those hotpluggable vCPU objects can't be avoided
during the bootup time.

No, it's not what I was suggesting. What I suggested is to avoid creating those hotpluggable
vCPU objects (place holders) during the bootup time. However, all vCPU file descriptors (KVM
objects) still need to be created and initialized before GICv3 is initialized. It's one of
the constrains. So we need to create and populate all vCPU file descriptors through
ioctl(vm_fd, CREATE_VCPU) and ioctl(vcpu_fd, INIT_VCPU) before GICv3 object is created and
realized. As I explained in the previous reply, the hotpluggable vCPU objects (place holders)
haven't to be created in order to initialize and populate the vCPU file descriptors for those
hotpluggable vCPUs. I think the parameters used to create and initialize vCPU-0's file descriptor
can be reused by all other vCPUs, because we don't support heterogeneous vCPUs.

What I suggested is something like below: the point is to avoid instantiating those hotpluggable
vCPUs, but their vCPU file descriptor (KVM object) are still created and initialized.

     static void machvirt_init(MachineState *machine)
     {

         /*
          * Instantiate and realize vCPU-0, record the parameter passed to
          * ioctl(vcpu-fd, VCPU_INIT, &init), or a better place to remember the parameter.
          * The point is the parameter can be shared by all vCPUs.
          */

         /*
          * Create vCPU descriptors for all other vCPUs (including hotpluggable vCPUs).
          * The remembered parameter is reused and passed to ioctl(vcpu-fd, VCPU_INIT, &init).
          */

         /* Instanaite and realize other cold-booted vCPUs */

         /* Instantiate and realize GICv3 */

     }

It seems my suggestion wasn't fully understood. I was suggesting to avoid instantiating
those hotpluggable vCPU objects (place holders) during QEMU startup time. All vCPU file
descriptors (the vCPU's corresponding objects) still need to be in place before GICv3
object is initiated and realized.

Thanks for the linker to the slides. Yeah, it's nice to reduce the bootup time
and memory footprint if possible. vCPU hotplug feature may help to improve the
performance, but all other paths might also impact the performance. In summary,
it's a comprehensive goal to reduce the memory footprint and bootup time, and
other components (paths) need optimization to achieve this goal.

It's what has been implemented in this series. My concern remains: why those
vCPU hotpluggable objects can't be avoided? Again, their corresponding vCPU
file descritpors (KVM vCPU objects) still have to be in place before GICv3
is instantiated and realized.

Again, my suggestion wasn't completely understood. I was suggesting to avoid instantiating
those hotpluggable objects, but their vCPU file descriptors still need to be in place
before GICv3's instantiation and realization.

Yes, I was also concerned that too much code changes would be needed if my suggestion is
accepted. It will definitely delay the feature's upstreaming process. It's why I said the
topic (to avoid the hotpluggable objects) are just for discussion now. We can do it (as
separate optimization) after your current implementation is merged.

umm, As I explained from the beginning, all KVM vCPU file descriptors are still
in place before GICv3 is instantiated and realized. With those KVM vCPU file
descriptor, we shouldn't have problem except more code changes are needed, or
I miss something? :)

Remember you just had the architecture agnostic series merged. The vCPU file
descriptor can be parked and picked up at a later time based on the vCPU index.
This KVM vCPU create in batch mode can be well supported. What you need to is
record the parameters passed to ioctl(vm_fd, CREATE_VCPU, index) and ioctl(vcpu_fd,
INIT_CPU) for vCPU-0 in hw/arm/virt.c and create all other vCPU file descriptors
based on the recorded parameters.
