Canonical initially reported migration failures between QEMU 10.0 and
10.1, so their 10.0 build lacked the original two fixups.

Adding the compat option to pc_compat_9_2 can help stable v10.0.[4,5],
but Canonical's case will still fail.

I think that if Canonical officially adopts v10.0.[0-3] and hasn't used
v10.0.[4,5], reverting might be a more viable option. If they plan to
use v10.0.[4,5], then the current solution is preferable. Understanding
Canonical's v10.0 status can help evaluate the impact of different
options.
