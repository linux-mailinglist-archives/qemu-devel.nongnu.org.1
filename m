Technically both can happen. But that would just be the case of
file:fdset migration which requires an extra fd for O_DIRECT. So
"multiple" in the usual sense of "more is better" is only
fd-per-thread. IOW, using multiple fds is an implementation detail IMO,
what people really care about is medium saturation, which we can only
get (with multifd) via parallelization.

AFAIK, we tend to not do that in QEMU docs.

All of QEMU developers, libvirt developers, cloud software developers,

Sure, I can expand on those.

device state migration with multifd has been merged for 10.0

<rant>
If it were up to me, we'd have a pool of multifd threads that transmit
everything migration-related. Unfortunately, that's not so
straight-forward to implement without rewriting a lot of code, multifd
requires too much entanglement from the data producer. We're constantly
dealing with details of data transmission getting in the way of data
production/consumption (e.g. try to change ram.c to produce multiple
pages at once and watch everyting explode).

I've been experimenting with a MultiFDIov payload type to allow
separation between the data type handling details and multifd inner
workings. However in order for that to be useful we'd need to have a
sync that doesn't depend on control data on the main migration
thread. That's why I've been asking about a multifd-only sync with Peter
in the other thread.

There's a bunch of other issues as well:

- no clear distinction between what should go in the header and what
  should go in the packet.

- the header taking up one slot in the iov, which should in theory be
  responsibility of the client

- the whole multifd_ops situation which doesn't allow a clear interface
  between multifd and client

- the lack of uniformity between send/recv in regards to doing I/O from
  multifd code or from client code

- the recv having two different modes of operation, socket and file

the list goes on...

I'll try to produce some ascii art.
