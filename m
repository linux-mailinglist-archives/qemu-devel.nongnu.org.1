Look at this series where this is used (I also included this patch there 
as patch 2 which is identical to this v3 standalone patch):

https://patchew.org/QEMU/cover.1746139668.git.balaton@eik.bme.hu/

This patch allows removing explicit name properties in patch 3 and move 
the static parts into a dtb file in patch 4. Dtb does not allow to set 
name property and will use the path name for it but e.g. the root of the 
device tree on some machines must have a specific name. On Apple it's 
called device-tree and on pegasos it's bPlan,Pegasos and some guests (e.g. 
MorphOS) checks this to detect what machine they run on so will fail it we 
return / or no name for the name of the root node. Therefore in patch 4 I 
still have a

qemu_fdt_setprop_string(fdt, "/", "name", "bplan,Pegasos2");

to make this work, and for some nodes it may still be needed although for 
most the path name from dtb will be correct so no need to add a name 
property for those. But becuase of these nodes that need a name different 
from their path we still need to allow explicit name properties.

BALATON Zoltan
