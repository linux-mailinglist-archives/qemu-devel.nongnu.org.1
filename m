All of this should work without vTPMs. Why add complexity when you don't 
need it? The industry is already struggling to deal with TPMs alone. 
There are way too many potential holes in a solution where you first 
have to reason about the integrity of your TPM before you can trust it. 
All of the vTPM in SEV-SNP talk is a house of cards I'm happy to push 
(blow to keep the analogy?) against as hard as I can.

I don't follow. Is RH going to ship a UKI or a FUKI? And if RH ships the 
UKI, ukify could still take a UKI as input and generate a FUKI based on 
it, no? During that process, it would generate a db which gets put at a 
fixed location in RAM so the (RH provided) firmware picks it up and 
validates the UKI it loads is exactly that one UKI.

We can extend that with an additional signature flow, where the ukify 
generated db contains a signature for the UKI instead. But I would 
generally advise against optimizing for certificate based flows until 
revocation is sorted out. And since revocation requires a new dbx in 
this scheme and that means a different launch digest per revocation, you 
may as well just directly only use hashes.

This only makes sense in a world where RH ships an SVSM and that's all 
you want to attest. But that's a different flow from what we describe 
here. To actually get workload attestation, you need to include your 
rootfs in the attestation. And the only entity that can do that is the 
end customer. And they will typically do that through something like 
dm-verity or fs-verity and a hash provided on the kernel command line.

I'm still not convinced "RH signature" is a useful marker at execution 
time of confidential workloads. It may be an interesting one at assembly 
time, but after that we're folding everything into a single launch 
digest anyway, for good reasons.

I would personally consider the "RH binary adds RH signature into binary 
by default" a backdoor, but that's you call :).

I agree with the plan to amend the IGVM spec with the UEFI variable 
update page. I don't think it should be "db" and "dbx" pages. It should 
be a more generic. In fact, why not make it a loader UEFI (PE) binary? 
The binary installs the db/dbx updates and chain loads the actual 
payload UKIs using a file format that's private between the loader 
binary and the sd-boot stub.

It would be a pretty natural fit for it, no?
