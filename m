I see what I overlook; it's used much more than I thought in qtest and we
also have a CI for it.. So ok, let's keep at least QEMU_TEST_FLAKY_TESTS.

But again, I don't think it matters much even if we rename it, it means the
flaky CI test won't run these two migration tests, but that's not the end
of the world either, if you see what I meant.  CI relies on the normal
tests rather than flaky tests to present.

We should be able to move in / take out FLAKY tests at will, as that's not
what CI is really relying on.  Here renaming the macro in migration test
almost means we take both out.

Not fair at all: nobody suggested to rename the test!

Yes, but so far the "API" is the test name only (and actually not.. more
below), and at least no path involved.  That's why I want to make sure
we're on the same page.  So looks like at least "what tests to run by
default", and "full path of each of the test case" can still change.

Here's the "more below" part: logically if we want we can change the name
of migration-test.  We need to teach the CI on which version of QEMU to use
which program to test in the compat tests.  It isn't really hard (a git-tag
-> prog-name hash), it's just unnecessary to change the test name at all.

I'm not going to change any.. but keeping it a protocol is another thing.

So to summarize..

My plan (after adjustment, keeping the name of QEMU_TEST_FLAKY_TESTS) is to
introduce QEMU_TEST_EXTRA_TESTS (renamed following FLAKY) and cover the
three current "slow" tests.  Then we stick with -m for the new quick/slow,
which maps to tcg/kvm directly.  That saves the extra --full parameter.

The diff v.s. your plan is, afaict, you prefer introducing yet another
--full parameter.

Yours is good that we stick with the whole test in compat tests with no
extra change, which is a benefit indeed.

If go with my plan, the default compat behavior will start to change after
10.0 released.  We need to do one more step if we still prefer the wholeset
run in compat test, which is at the start of 10.1, we send a patch to
change compat test's parameter from none to "-m slow".

Feel free to go ahead with whatever you prefer.  To me, the more important
bit is whether we both think that one program is better than two, and also
that means decouple host setup v.s. tests. I don't have a strong opinion
otherwise..
