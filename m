Meson is usually explicit (thus sometimes verbose) and unambiguous, 
which are two very nice virtues, especially for build systems and tests, 
at least for my personal taste. You don't want to spend time reverse 
engineering the test infrastructure itself when you try to understand 
why a fail happened or when writing a new test.

Another additional benefit of listing setup + suite + test in an 
exhaustive way is that your command line never change to run any 
specific test, whatever your current setup is.

If I had to choose between a wider terminal output and spending time 
with grep and find to understand what is running, I would pick the 
former any time.

Maybe the complexity comes from our usage of test setups here, to 
differentiate categories that will download, vs the one that will not. 
We already talked about that in another thread, and I still think that 
having a single setup (thorough), which could be the default, would make 
things easier, even if people should accept to connect to Internet from 
time to time to update their tests assets. They do it to download new 
versions of QEMU or interact with the mailing list anyway. That said, 
I'm not trying to open the can of worms again, just pointing that it may 
be related to this topic.
