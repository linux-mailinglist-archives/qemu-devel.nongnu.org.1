Although it has been extended to SNP in QEMU, personally I'd consider
the QEMU 'kernel hashes' functionality to be an niche feature.

From a virt mgmt POV we know in general that direct kernel boot while
useful, is somewhat limited in usage. Most of the time it is saner to
have the guest decide what kernel to boot without interaction of the
host. So by extension, the kernel hashes feature is also going to be
a similarly (or even more) niche use case. The UKI with system extensions
and secureboot model gives much greater flexibility for defining policy
around valid configurations than using fixed hashes - especially when
it comes to kernel command line which has potentially many valid configs.

I view the launch secrets feature as a crutch to cope with the HW
limitations of SEV/SEV-ES. You have the host initiated attestation
dance and after verification can pass data back to the host, which
will inject it into the guest. The inability to have a secure TPM
in SEV/SEV-ES forces you down this road. It is highly undesirable
as a feature going forward because we're better served by having
a boot workflow that is common to traditional virt, confidential
virt, and bare metal, and TPM delivers on that.

With regards,
Daniel
