I considered those other general tags to be under the scope
of submitting-a-patch.rst, as they're not directly related
to the legal code provenance.

Yep, IMHO it is worth guiding users to a simple example that works.
If they are advanced users of emacs or other editors wanting to figure
out other options they can ignore this guidance.
