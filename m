I found https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3D259673 -- I'm
not sure if anyone has tried to implement something cross-arch.

Yes, if someone(tm) wrote a QEMU device for that, we'd have something
that should be quite useful across archs (well, excluding s390, which
has its own watchdog anyway.)

Given all of that, I still think that leaving i6300ESB as-is is the
right thing, with a possible option of implementing the WADT watchdog.
