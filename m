Okay, so assuming that the correctly named binaries will apply whatever
necessary magic to have them behave identically as they did.

I'll also ignore the distros that rename them assuming they do it in a
way that stays compatible.

The question is how the new unified binary will behave when being
introspected:

 - Can the unified binary be introspected without selecting an
   architecture?
   (by introspection I mean starting with -M none and querying stuff via
   QMP)

   if no: libvirt will have a chicken&egg problem deciding what to do

 - What will be the answer for the platform-specific stuff such as CPU
   definitions?

   e.g. does/can an architecture need to be instantiated later via QMP?
   can it be changed dynamically?
