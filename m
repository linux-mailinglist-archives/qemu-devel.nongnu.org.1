Yeah, after reading patch 4, I still want to check with you on whether this
is possible, on a simpler version of such soluion.

As we discussed offlist, looks like there's no perfect solution for
synchronizing between src <-> dst on this matter.  No matter what is the
last message to be sent, either precopy has RP_SHUT, or relying on 3rd/4th
PONG, or RUN_ACK, it might get lost in a network failure.

IIUC it means we need to face the situation of split brain. The link can
simply be broken at any time.  The ultimate result is still better when two
VMs will be halted when split brain, but then IMHO we'll need to justify
whether that complexity would be worthwhile for changing "both sides
active" -> "both sides halted" when it happened.

If we go back to the original request of why we decided to work on this: it
was more or less a feature parity request on postcopy against precopy, so
that when device states loading failed during switchover, postcopy can also
properly get cancelled rather than hanging.  Precopy can do that, we wished
postcopy can do at least the same.

Could we still explore the simpler idea and understand better on the gap
between the two?  E.g. relying on the 3rd/4th PONG returned from the dest
QEMU to be the ACK message.

Something like:

  - Start postcopy...

  - Send the postcopy wholesale package (which includes e.g. whole device
    states dump, PING-3, RUN), as before.

  - Instead of going directly POSTCOPY_ACTIVE, we stay in DEVICE, but we
    start to allow iterations to resolve page faults while keep moving
    pages.

  - If...

    - we received the 3rd PONG, we _assume_ the device states are loaded
      successfully and the RUN must be processed, src QEMU moves to
      POSTCOPY_ACTIVE.

    - we noticed network failure before 3rd PONG, we _assume_ destination
      failed to load or crashed, src QEMU fails the migration (DEVICE ->
      FAILED) and try to restart VM on src.

This might be a much smaller change, and it might not need any change from
dest qemu or stream protocol.

It means, if it works (even if imperfect) it'll start to work for old VMs
too as long as they got migrated to the new QEMU, and we get this postcopy
parity feature asap instead of requesting user to cold-restart the VM with
a newer machine type.

Would this be a better possible trade-off?

Thanks,
