Yes it did go pretty far. But VMState is where you hit the barrier for a
very specific reason: the thing that you want to produce (structs with
pointers to other structs) isn't supported by compile time execution until
that version, so you're stuck writing C-style code for migration. These
structs have been very central to how QEMU does reflection, for more than
15 years, and there's no real workaround for that.

It's certainly possible to delay fully safe VMState some more, but perhaps
not 2-3 years.

Most of the updates to Meson were done in the first year after switching,
because of new features in Meson that were contributed specifically for use
in QEMU. For example, "meson test" was improved to include all the features
of the preexisting "make check" (and many more), which benefited all users
of Meson. Since then we have only had one bleeding edge update in 2023,
when Apple messed up their linker's --version and we had to update in order
to help our macOS users (issue 1939).

Rust support does require more frequent updates to Meson because QEMU is
actually quite an early adopter among large C projects. Apart from
juggernauts like Firefox or Linux, I can only think of three: librsvg,
GStreamer and Mesa. Even Chromium (which builds with GN) only uses it for
some vendored third party libraries, with C++ bindings to Rust code. But I
can make these updates optional for people that don't --enable-rust; at the
same time I have no interest in building a pile of workarounds for those
that do.

Anyhow while I am contributing Rust-related improvements to Meson, I have
no plans, time or ability to contribute to Rust. :)

I agree.

We've never made exceptions for Python in the sense of requiring a custom
Python interpreter. The interpreters we require have always been available
in all supported distros. What we did is not using the distro's *sphinx* on
enterprise distros whose default Python interpreter was way past EOL. (IMHO
shipping in /usr/bin anything that can run user Python code is a mistake,
because it conflicts with the idea that /usr/libexec/platform-python is
invisible to the user).

That came a few years *after* Meson and it happened because it's harder and
harder to support both very new and very old versions of Python, especially
after EOL. Our desires in that respect conflict very much with how the
Python community operates, unfortunately.

We can rationalize it is as "users only need to do x, y & z to get newer

I agree. But the Python change is mostly water under the bridge, and the
bleeding edge Meson requirements could be made optional for those that
don't use Rust, so I don't think it's too bad.

For Rust, this submission shows exactly what the benefit would be and the
current status of the code shows how far you get without it. I don't want
to sneak in anything, I have posted it for transparency and it's up to the
community to discuss how to proceed. We can do so at the community call or
wait until KVM Forum.

Thanks,

Paolo
