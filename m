So I know what is happening but not sure on the solution yet.
The issue is on unbind of the region there is a call to try_remove_memory()
and that calls memblock_phys_free(). That removes the reserved memblocks being used
for tracking the numa node, so when you bind a region at that HPA again, there
is no tracking information.

So far I haven't figured out why that call is there in the first place
which isn't helping me solve this.

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.1/source/mm/memory_hotplug.c#L2286

Until I get this code out there, kind of hard to ask the mm folk
- for now I may just have to say it only works once and point at that
line as the problem in an RFC.

Long shot, but Dan, did you run into this when you were doing your 
[PATCH v2 08/22] memblock: Introduce a generic phys_addr_to_target_node()
stuff?  I assume that ultimately called try_remove_memory() in a remove
path somewhere and similarly to this if you try putting it back it
would be missing.  Or alternatively, any idea why what that memblock_phys_free()
is balancing with?
