While the design / impl technically allows for concurrent input to be
sent to the frontend, from multiple backends, in practice I don't think
we need to be particularly concerned about it.

I don't see this as being a way for multiple different users to interact
concurrently. Rather I'd see 1 user of the VM just deciding to switch
from one backend to the other on the fly. IOW, although technically
possible, the user will only be leveraging one at a time to send input.

We very definitely do need all backends to receive output from the guest
concurrently too, as you'd want the historical output context to be
visible on whatever backend you choose to use at any given point in time.

If a user decides to be crazy and send input from multiple backends
concurrently, then they get to keep the mess.

Agreed, I think this is desirable. If you did the exclusive access mode,
it'd complicate things as you now need a way to switch between active
backends, while also reducing the usefulness of it.

The main thing I'm not a fan of here is the naming 'mux-fe', as I think we
should have something distinct from current 'mux', to reduce confusion
when we're talking about it.

How about 'overlay' or 'replicator' ? 

With regards,
Daniel
