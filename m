I agree, and that's why the current solution is not the final word on 
this question. My position on the single binary is that runtime 
compromises can be acceptable on our translation path (since it's not 
where we spend most of our time anyway), but definitely not on code 
generated by tcg, which has to be optimal.

In the first version of this series, I defined TCGv as an opaque type 
(i.e. not typedef to i32 or i64), and wrote wrappers for tcg_gen_* ops 
that were casting it to appropriate type and called the i32 or i64 
variants based on current context. After talking with Richard, I 
understood it was not useful for target/arm, since code has been cleanly 
splitted between 32/64 bits, so dropped it for the TCG_ADDRESS_BITS 
approach.

That said, I still think the opaque type + wrapper approach has its 
place for some architectures. It could be used for code where rewriting 
is too complicated, and still allow to generate efficient code. The 
downside is that we need some boilerplate in headers to generate this, 
but it's not something a macro can't help to deal with.
