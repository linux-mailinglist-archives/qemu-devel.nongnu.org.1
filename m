The problem with this is that now virt-install  has to actually
find the correct a shim.efi binary. It is already somewhat hard
to find a suitable kerenl+initrd binary, and AFAIK, the places
where we get these binaries don't have shim.efi alongside.

eg for RHEL/Fedora we grab kernel+initrd from the pxeboot dir:

  https://fedora.mirrorservice.org/fedora/linux/development/rawhide/Everything/x86_64/os/images/pxeboot/

This same problem with affect both options (a) and (c).

In various forums we have discussed adding the secureboot
certs to the libosinfo database, so that we can have a
customized EFI varstore with minimized certs, even for the
ISO / HDD boot scenario. If we do that, then (b) is trivial
for direct kernel boot too. (b) kills all birds with the
same stone :-)

I guess (b) + (D) is probably my preference.
