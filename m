I don't know much about the originals of RDMA support in QEMU and why
this particular design was taken. It is indeed a huge maint burden to
have a completely different code flow for RDMA with 4000+ lines of
custom protocol signalling which is barely understandable.

I would note that /usr/include/rdma/rsocket.h provides a higher level
API that is a 1-1 match of the normal kernel 'sockets' API. If we had
leveraged that, then QIOChannelSocket class and the QAPI SocketAddress
type could almost[1] trivially have supported RDMA. There would have
been almost no RDMA code required in the migration subsystem, and all
the modern features like compression, multifd, post-copy, etc would
"just work".

I guess the 'rsocket.h' shim may well limit some of the possible
performance gains, but it might still have been a better tradeoff
to have not quite so good peak performance, but with massively
less maint burden.

With regards,
Daniel

[1] "almost" trivially, because the poll() integration for rsockets
    requires a bit more magic sauce since rsockets FDs are not
    really FDs from the kernel's POV. Still, QIOCHannel likely can
    abstract that probme.
