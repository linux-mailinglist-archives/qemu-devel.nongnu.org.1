We definitely do not.

To deprecate a QMP command, event, argument or result, we add the
feature flag.  One-liner, basically impossible to screw up.

Review should then catch a missing update to deprecated.rst.

Same for un-deprecating something.

So far, this is as simple as it could possibly be.  That's a feature.

A warning requires additional handwritten code.  Which *can* be screwed
up.  Moreover, missing warning (add or delete) is easy to miss in
review.

If we want such warnings for QMP, they should be automated just like the
-compat actions.  Any existing warnings rendered redundant should then
be taken out.  I considered that when I did -compat, and rejected it as
not worth the effort.
