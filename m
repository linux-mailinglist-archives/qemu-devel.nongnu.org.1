Yes, because if one write fails, we know that the following writes will fail too
as they will not be aligned to the write pointer. These subsequent failed writes
will again trigger the report zones and update, but that is fine. All of them
have failed and the report will give the same wp again.

This is a typical pattern with zoned block device: if one write fails in a zone,
the user has to expect failures for all other writes issued to the same zone, do
a report zone to get the wp and restart writing from there.
