I would be in favor of a 9.1 merge (disabled, not auto).
Noting that soft-freeze is two weeks from today, so no dilly dallying.  :-)

The only reasonable alternative that I see is the kind of development branch that qemu is 
not used to having: a long-term shared branch on qemu-projects.  With which I would be ok, 
up to and including a branch merge at the end, as I'm used to working that way with other 
projects.

I think the only reason to delay the current development work until 9.2 is if we were 
still questioning whether using Rust *at all* is a good idea.  I think we're beyond that 
point.
