Hmm, I'll reproduce and debug further.  The intention here is that BARs
for the device in D3hot would not be DMA mapped, effectively as if the
memory enable bit in the command register were cleared, therefore I'd
hoped the listener is not called for this range.

I added a patch to my branch that removes the redundant pm_cap from the
PCIExressDevice.  It just wasn't clear, and really still isn't, why
this cap offset had been cached on the express object rather than the
conventional PCI device object.  Regardless, it can be consolidated.
Thanks,
