Hi, Avihai,

I am queuing patch 1 as it does look like a real bug to fix asap.  I'll
copy stable for that one.  For such patches, feel free to post separately
next time if you think I should merge earlier than the rest.

For the thread race issue: I believe it should be fully covered by
Fabiano's series, at least that's the plan.  Let me know if there's still
something missing.

For the rest: I didn't closely check, but obviously many of the changes
will not apply after applying Fabiano's fix on the thread races.  If you
have anything that still think worth merging, please rebase to that (or
wait for my pull; it should happen this week).

Thanks,

--
