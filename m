To potentially save time I think Igor is asking that before you do anything
at all you plug the existing test hole which is that we don't test HEST
at all.   Even after this series I think we don't test HEST.  You add
a stub hest and exclusion but then in patch 12 the HEST stub is deleted whereas
it should be replaced with the example data for the test.

That indeed doesn't address testing the error data storage which would be
a different problem.

If we did do this the test would use a fixed number of CPUs so
would just verify we didn't break a small number of variants. Useful
but to me a follow up to this series not something that needs to
be part of it - particularly as Gavin's work may well change that!

Agreed that a more end to end test is even better, but those are
quite a bit more complex so definitely a follow up.
