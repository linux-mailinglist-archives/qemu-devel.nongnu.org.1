In what situation do we ever start running a VCPU before
the *GIC* has been realized? The GIC should get realized
as part of creating the virt board, which must complete
before we do anything like running a vcpu.

Yes, and my suggestion is that the failure you are seeing is only
because you have got half-created vcpu objects. Your backtrace
shows that the error here is not EBUSY, but ENOTTY.
