Yes there's no rush.

If you agree with the change, feel free to clean this helper up when you
post the vfio changes.  We can still have one more helper exported before
that.

Thanks a lot.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I need to confess this may not be the right place to invoke it=
 in ram.c (I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; think we probably should move it out at some point.. into gene=
ric migration<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; code).=C2=A0 However I don&#39;t yet see why log_start() is no=
t called first in your<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; case before log_sync().<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Could you elaborate?<br>
&gt;&gt; Indeed, in the above code log_start is called before log_sync.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I was referring to the case where some other code path triggers lo=
g_sync.<br>
&gt;&gt; E.g., if you open a VNC to the guest then it constantly calls log_=
sync to<br>
&gt;&gt; refresh the graphics. In that case, one of these log_syncs can hap=
pen<br>
&gt;&gt; between &quot;migration status is set to SETUP&quot; and &quot;glo=
bal tracking is started&quot;.<br>
&gt; I see.=C2=A0 That&#39;s unfortunate..<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Though this is also the case where it shouldn&#39;t be VFIO&#39;s prob=
lem alone.<br>
&gt; See some other users of log_sync():<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; vhost_sync_dirty_bitmap():<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 if (!dev-&gt;log_enabled || !dev-&gt;started) {<br=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 return 0;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 }<br>

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 if (ret =3D=3D -ENOENT) {<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 /* kernel does not have dirty bitmap=
 in this slot */<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 ret =3D 0;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 }<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; And I didn&#39;t further look.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; In short, IMHO looks like VFIO still shouldn&#39;t be special on diffe=
reciating<br>
&gt; and make migration export the SETUP phase just for this..=C2=A0 as VFI=
O has<br>
&gt; log_start() like all the rest, so VFIO can also know whether tracking =
is<br>
&gt; enabled at all, then it can silently no-op the log_sync() like all the=
 rest<br>
&gt; of the users.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If you agree, I&#39;d prefer we keep this patch - it&#39;ll be nice we=
 only ever<br>
&gt; expose migration_is_running() for migration status checks, without exp=
osing<br>
&gt; SETUP only for this VFIO use case even if it could have followed what =
other<br>
&gt; modules are doing.<br>
<br>
Yes, I agree this could be a nice cleanup.<br>
<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If you would like to propose a patch for VFIO, I&#39;d be happy to inc=
lude your<br>
&gt; patch before this patch (just in case this patch could land some day) =
to<br>
&gt; make sure VFIO works as before.=C2=A0 Since I don&#39;t have VFIO HW t=
o test, it&#39;ll<br>
&gt; be challenging for me to propose and test such patch otherwise.<br>
<br>
I can do that, though it may be a bit involved because VFIO has multiple <b=
r>
dirty tracking mechanisms (legacy, device DPT and IOMMU DPT). Plus, I <br>
don&#39;t have HW that supports IOMMU DPT at hand for testing.<br>
I assume this is not an urgent cleanup, right?<br></blockquote></div></div>=
