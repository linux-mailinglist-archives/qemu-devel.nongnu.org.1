How does the guest know to write a remappable vector format?  How does
the guest know the host interrupt architecture?  For example why would
an aarch64 guest program an MSI vector of 0xfee... if the host is x86?

The idea of guest owning the physical MSI address space sounds great,
but is it practical?  Is it something that would be accomplished while
this device is still relevant?

The Windows driver is just programming the MSI capability to use 16
vectors.  We configure those vectors on the host at the time the
capability is written.  Whereas the Linux driver is only using a single
vector and therefore writing the same MSI address and data at the
locations noted in the trace, the Windows driver is writing different
data values at different locations to make use of those vectors.  This
note is simply describing that we can't directly write the physical
data value into the device, we need to determine which vector offset
the guest is using and provide the same offset from the host data
register value.

I don't know that interrupt remapping is specifically required, but the
MSI domain needs to support MSI_FLAG_MULTI_PCI_MSI and AFAIK that's
only available with interrupt remapping on x86, ie.
pci_alloc_irq_vectors() with max_vecs >1 and PCI_IRQ_MSI flags needs to
work on the host to mirror the guest MSI configuration.  Thanks,

Alex
