I agree that 1) is ugly.  So far, I've added some temporary
assertions, to see when qio_channel_tls_handshake is reached; it looks
like nbd/server.c is calling it from within coroutine context, but
nbd/client.c is calling it from the main loop.  The qio code handles
either, but now I'm stuck in trying to get client.c into having the
right coroutine context; the TLS handshake is done before the usual
BlockDriverState *bs object is available, so I'm not even sure what
aio context, if any, I should be using.  But on my first try, I'm
hitting:

qemu-img: ../util/async.c:707: aio_co_enter: Assertion `self != co' failed.

so I obviously got something wrong.

It may be possible to use block_gen_c to turn nbd_receive_negotiate
and nbd_receive_export_list into co_wrapper functions, if I can audit
that all of their code goes through qio (and is therefore
coroutine-safe), but that work is still ongoing.

At any rate, qemu-iotest 233 should be good for testing that changes
in this area work; I've also been testing with libnbd (test
interop/interop-qemu-nbd-tls-certs hits qemu's server.c) and nbdkit
(test tests/test-tls-psk.sh hits qemu's client.c).
