If we had a linear state transition table, i.e. a DFA without any
branching, that would be ideal. But since we have states that can reach
(and be reached from) multiple other states, then we'll always need some
input to migration_change_state(). Here you're making it the
s->trigger. Where will that come from?

Looking at runstate.c and job.c, it seems we could at least define a
state transition table and do away with the second parameter to
migrate_set_state(s, old, new).

As we've been discussing, the current state-change mechanism has the
dual purpose of emitting the state change event and also serving as
internal tracking of the migration state. It's not clear to me whether
you're covering both in this proposal or just one of them.

I don't think we've established actually what are the goals of having
any state changes. Do we even need state changes for internal tracking?
We could use your s->trigger as an enum and just check it wherever
necessary. And keep the MIGRATION_STATUS exclusive for the external API,
in which case, it's probably better to just set it unconditionally (in
many places migrate_set_state already takes the current state as
argument, i.e. it doesn't care about the current state).
