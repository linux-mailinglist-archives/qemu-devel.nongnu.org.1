I am not a native speaker but I think the commit message could be
rephrased to make it clear. This is a minor comment so feel free to
ignore it:

Before `virtio_reset()` is invoked, `virtio_set_status(vdev, 0)` for
vhost devices ends up setting `vhost_stared` to false thus resulting in
`vhost_reset_device()` being never reached during a reset.

`vhost_started` is not documented, however, from `vhost_dev_start()` and
`vhost_dev_stop()`, it seems indicating that there is a vhost back-end
and that the back-end is running and processing virtio requests.
Resetting should not rely on whether the vhost back-end is processing
virtio requests, instead, reset must happen if there is no processing
request. This is what `virtio_reset()` does, it first stops the backend
and then sends the reset.

To trigger a reset, this commit drops the `vhost_started` condition and
checks that the device is running (introduced by 95e1019a4a9) but also
that the vhost back-end is connected so it is possible to send a reset
to the vhost device.

Matias
