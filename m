If we're deviating from the kernel's text (which is *fine*), let's get
rid of the parenthesis:

    using a known identity.  Contributions cannot be anonymous.

or in active voice:

    using a known identity.  We cannot accept anonymous contributions.

I like this one the best.

Good idea.  Should this go here or under "Subsystem maintainer
requirements"?

 the

Yes, but should it go into code-provenance.rst or
submitting-a-patch.rst?

You asked for guidance on use of "Message-Id:" in your review of v2.  I
understand the practice, and can write guidance, but I wanted to get
this out before my vacation next week, so I left it for later, as
mentioned in the cover letter.

How do we use "Link:"?  What about "Closes:"?

Here's what the kernel's submitting-patches.rst has to say:

    Describe your changes
    ---------------------

    [...]

    If related discussions or any other background information behind the c=
hange
    can be found on the web, add 'Link:' tags pointing to it. If the patch =
is a
    result of some earlier mailing list discussions or something documented=
 on the
    web, point to it.

    When linking to mailing list archives, preferably use the lore.kernel.o=
rg
    message archiver service. To create the link URL, use the contents of t=
he
    ``Message-ID`` header of the message without the surrounding angle brac=
kets.
    For example::

        Link: https://lore.kernel.org/30th.anniversary.repost@klaava.Helsin=
ki.FI

    Please check the link to make sure that it is actually working and poin=
ts
    to the relevant message.

    However, try to make your explanation understandable without external
    resources. In addition to giving a URL to a mailing list archive or bug,
    summarize the relevant points of the discussion that led to the
    patch as submitted.

    In case your patch fixes a bug, use the 'Closes:' tag with a URL refere=
ncing
    the report in the mailing list archives or a public bug tracker. For ex=
ample::

            Closes: https://example.com/issues/1234

    Some bug trackers have the ability to close issues automatically when a
    commit with such a tag is applied. Some bots monitoring mailing lists c=
an
    also track such tags and take certain actions. Private bug trackers and
    invalid URLs are forbidden.

and

    Using Reported-by:, Tested-by:, Reviewed-by:, Suggested-by: and Fixes:
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Reported-by tag gives credit to people who find bugs and report the=
m and it
    hopefully inspires them to help us again in the future. The tag is inte=
nded for
    bugs; please do not use it to credit feature requests. The tag should be
    followed by a Closes: tag pointing to the report, unless the report is =
not
    available on the web. The Link: tag can be used instead of Closes: if t=
he patch
    fixes a part of the issue(s) being reported. Note, the Reported-by tag =
is one
    of only three tags you might be able to use without explicit permission=
 of the
    person named (see 'Tagging people requires permission' below for detail=
s).

Showing one of them could still be useful for less experienced Emacs
users.  We could mention it's just of many ways.

Can do if somebody contributes a suitable configuration snippet.

Thanks!
