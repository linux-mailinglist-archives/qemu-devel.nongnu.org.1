This patch is trying to implement SiFive specific event encodings.
There is no standard
RISC-V ISA involved here.

I happen to work on a similar implementation as well. Apologies for
not seeing this patch earlier.
Here is the link to the series that I have been working on to
implement a similar feature.
https://github.com/atishp04/qemu/tree/b4/pmu_event_machine
I will send it to the mailing list tomorrow after some checkpatch fixes.

Regarding the motivation, RISC-V ISA doesn't  define any standard
event encodings.
The virt machine implemented event encodings defined in the SBI PMU
extension because
there was nothing else available. There is an active performance
events TG who is working on defining
the standard events for RISC-V but not the encodings. The goal is
provide flexibility for the platforms while
allowing a minimum set of events that would work across platforms.

However, any platform would define their own event encodings and want
to support those in their Qemu
machine implementation. That's why, we should disassociate the event
encodings in the pmu.c to make it
more generic and usable across machines.

Thanks for Ccing me. I completely missed this patch earlier. Few
thoughts by looking at this series.

@Alexei:
1. Event encoding needs to be widened to 64 bits. That's what I tried
to achieve with my implementation
along with a bunch of other cleanups.

2. Why do we need machine specific counter write/read functions ? If
we really need it, we should definitely have that
as a separate patch as my implementation only focussed on
disassociating the events and pmu implementation.

Please take a look at the patches shared above or the mailing list
(should land tomorrow) and let me know your thoughts.
I am happy to collaborate on your patches so that we have more than
just a virt machine that we can test with this series.
