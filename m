I think I wouldn't necessarily merge it if we don't have code that makes
use of it, but having it on the list as an RFC can't hurt either way.
Then we can come back to it once we do need it for something.

Does your bdrv_co_flush_all() take the graph (reader) lock? If so, this
is surprising, because while we hold the graph lock, no reference should
be able to go away - you need the writer lock for that and you won't get
it as long as bdrv_co_flush_all() locks the graph. So whatever had a
reference before the bdrv_next() loop must still have it now. Do you
know where it gets dropped?
