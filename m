Thanks.  I really hope we can stick with patch 1 only for now, and we leave
patches like 2-3 for future, or probably never.

I want to avoid more magical tunables, and I want to avoid the code harder
to read.  Unlike most of other migration features, auto converge so far is
already pretty heavy on the "engineering" aspect of things.  More people
care about downtime with 100ms or even less, then it makes zero sense a
throttle feature can stop a group of vCPUs for more than that easily.

I hope we can unite more dev/qe resources on postcopy across QEMU community
for enterprise users.  PoCs are always good stuff for QEMU as it's a
community project and people experiment things on it, but I hope at least
from design level, not small tunables like this one.  We could have
introduced 10 more tunables all over, feed them to AI and train some
numbers that migration can improve 10%, but IMHO that doesn't hugely help.

If you really care about convergence issues, I want to know whether you
agree on postcopy being a better way to go.  There're still plenty of
things we can do better in that area on either postcopy in general, or
downtime optimizations that lots of people are working (e.g. VFIO's), so
again IMHO it'll be good we keep focused there.

Thanks,
