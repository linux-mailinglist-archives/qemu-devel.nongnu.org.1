Let me explain my and Peter Xu's solutions by listing object references. 
It will abstract the details away and allow applying the analogy of 
other reference counting systems like Objective-C.

"Real" reference relationship
-----------------------------

First, I'll introduce one basic rule:

Rule 1. If A needs B, let A refer to B.

Now, There is an owner and a memory region. The owner needs the memory 
region to function. The memory region needs the owner to provide to 
allocate itself and e.g., to provide MemoryRegionOps for 
memory_region_init_io(). So we will make a bi-directional reference 
between the owner and the memory region.

O (Owner) -> MR (Memory Region)
MR -> O

Now, let's think the case where there is a container and subregion, and 
they are owned by different objects. The container needs the subregion 
to satisfy its accesses, and the subregion needs the container for 
memory_region_find(). So this relationship is also bi-directional.

CO (Container's Owner) -> C (Container)
C -> CO
SO (Subregions' Owner) -> S (Subregion)
S -> SO
C -> S
S -> C

Let's think someone took a reference to the container e.g., for DMA. 
This mean we add the following reference:

DMA Controller -> Container

This will ensure all of Container, Container's Owner, Subregion, 
Subregion's Owner are alive during the DMA.

"Weak" references
-----------------

Next, I'll impose the restriction that prevents circular references. To 
avoid circular references, we'll stop counting references for one 
direction. In other words, we'll make some references "weak". Weak 
references are prone to be dangling (in Objective-C or other platforms, 
such references will be usually replaced with nil-like values).

Rule 2. Make a reference from a memory region to its owner weak
Rule 3. Make a reference from a subregion to its container weak

CO -> C
C -> CO (weak)
SO -> S
S -> SO (weak)
C -> S
S -> C (weak)
D (DMA Controller) -> C

This will fix circular references, but unfortunately it will not work 
because DMA Controller requires weak references to reach to Container's 
Owner or Subregion's Owner with "strong" references; it means they can 
be dangling at any time.

To solve this problem, we'll introduce another rule:

Rule 4. Replace references to memory regions with references to their 
owners *except for the references from the owner to the memory region*.

CO -> C
C -> CO (weak)
SO -> S
S -> SO (weak)
C -> SO
S -> C (weak)
D -> CO

With this change, D can again reach all of CO, C, SO, and S.

Problem
-------

What if Container's Owner and Subregion's Owner are identical?

O -> C
C -> O (weak)
O -> S
S -> O (weak)
C -> O
S -> C (weak)
D -> O

Now there is a circular reference: O -> C -> O

My patch
--------

My patch amends rule 4:

Rule 4'. Replace references to memory regions with references to their 
owners *unless the reference originates from the owner*.

O -> C
C -> O (weak)
O -> S
S -> O (weak)
C -> S (this used to be C -> O)
S -> C (weak)
D -> O

Now the circular reference is gone.

Peter Xu's patch
----------------

Peter Xu's patch adds two new rules:

Rule 5. Make references from a container to its subregion weak if they 
are owned by the same object.

O -> C
C -> O (weak)
O -> S
S -> O (weak)
C -> O (weak [this used to be strong])
S -> C (weak)
D -> O

Now the circular reference is gone and D can still reach O, C, and S.

However, there is one problem: C requires a weak reference to reach to 
S. More concretely the pointer from C to S will be dangling when the 
reference O -> S gets dropped during the finalization of O.

Peter Xu's patch adds yet another rule to overcome this problem:

Rule 6. When a subregion gets finalized, drop the weak reference from 
its container to itself.

The dangling reference will be gone with this rule.

Comparison between the two patches
----------------------------------

I'll compare them by showing pros and cons of Peter Xu's patch.

Pro:
a. Will not add yet another direct reference to memory regions where 
currently there can be only one reference from the owner to each memory 
region.

Cons:
b. It requires two new rules.
c. C will see its reference to S to disappear at random timing due to a 
weak reference.

So, which is better do you think?
