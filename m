I added zero/zero-bytes because I thought they were not there. But it
turns out "duplicate" is for that purpose. "zero/zero-bytes" is really
additional information to "normal/normal-bytes". Peter suggested that
if we add "zero/zero-bytes" we can slowly retire "duplicate" at a
later point.
I don't know the historical reason why pages/bytes are used the way it
is today. The way I understand migration, the granularity of ram
migration is "page". There are only two types of pages 1) normal 2)
zero. Zero pages' playload are not sent through the network because we
already know what it looks like. Only the page offset is sent. Normal
pages are pages that are not zero. The entire page is sent through the
network to the target host. if a user knows the zero/normal count,
they can already calculate the zero-bytes/normal-bytes (zero/normal *
page size) but it's just convenient to see both. During development, I
check on these counters a lot and they are useful.
