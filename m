I'm not keen on such a restriction in QEMU.
QEMU is injecting lengths allowed by the specification.  That facility is
useful for testing the kernel and the QEMU modeling should not be based
on what the kernel supports.

When you said this I wondered if we had a clever implementation that fused
entries in the list, but we don't (I thought about doing so a long time
ago but seems I never bothered :)  So if you are using QEMU for testing
and you don't want to exceed the kernel supported poison lengths, don't
inject poison that big.
