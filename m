Great! Big thank you for doing this and looking forward to your patches. I 
found that it's often helpful to test with multiple different guests as 
these have different drivers that do things differently so that helps to 
identify corner cases and endian issues. Also I usually check both 
Rage128Pro and M6/RV100 docs for registers as sometimes these have 
additional info. One of those mentions that DP_GUI_MASTER_CNTL bits are 
aliases to other bits in other registers but this is not mentioned in the 
other doc. It's possible that I took shortcuts for bits that were not used 
and haven't implemented them as an alias as they should be. I'll review 
the series later.

BALATON Zoltan
