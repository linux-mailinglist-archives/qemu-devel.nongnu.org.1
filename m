This is definitely a problem then =E2=80=94 thank you for checking that so
clearly.

I=E2=80=99m still trying to get a hold of our IT team, and I=E2=80=99ll sha=
re this
information with them so they can look into enabling DKIM
properly for @huawei.com. Once I hear back from them or have any
concrete update, I=E2=80=99ll report it here so others aren=E2=80=99t hit b=
y the
same issue.

Many thanks again for your help.

Understood, thanks for clarifying.

If you happen to know who maintains the nongnu.org Mailman service,
or where I should direct questions about mail logs and DMARC handling,
a pointer would be very helpful.

Yes, that matches my observation as well. Messages from my
@huawei.com address do sometimes reach qemu-devel, but others
(particularly some patch series) appear to vanish. A couple of
colleagues have also mentioned similar intermittent issues in the
past, although it now seems to be affecting me more consistently.

What makes this confusing is that I have been using the same
git-send-email configuration and the same Outlook setup as before,
and earlier mails sent with these settings are present in the
qemu-devel archives. This suggests that something in the delivery
path, authentication checks, or domain policy may have changed
recently, even if not all @huawei.com senders are impacted in the
same way.

I am following up with our IT/mail team about DKIM and the correct
SMTP relay configuration for mailing lists. If it is easy to see
from the list side whether my recent missing patch mails were
rejected or filtered due to SPF/DMARC (as opposed to never
arriving at all), that information would be very helpful for that
discussion.

Many thanks again for your help in digging into this.

Got it, thanks for clarifying.

If you happen to know who is responsible for administering the
mailman service or whom I should contact to request more detailed
mail logs, that would be very helpful.

Many thanks!
