I'm not sure if it matters or not, maybe it depends on how bad it is when a
race happened.

If it's a tcp channel, it might be easier; the worst case is we write()
concurrently in two threads and the output stream, IIUC, can be interleaved
with the two buffers we write.  Not an issue if migration failed anyway.

However this is only needed for TLS, hence I have no idea what happens if
gnutls writes concurrently.  I don't think GnuTLS supports concurrent
writters.  I'm not sure if it means there's still chance src QEMU (when
having a failed live migration) can crash.

So.. I still think it might be wise we only bye() after knowing it is a
success, not only because that looks like the only way to make sure it's
thread-safe, but also because a bye() is only needed if it didn't fail.
Sending it ignoring error is another way of doing so, but it doesn't avoid
the possible result of a race (even if I totally agree it is unlikely..).

In v1, I was using "object_dynamic_cast((Object *)c, TYPE_QIO_CHANNEL_TLS)":

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250910160144.1762894-4-peterx@redhat.com/

Would that work the same, but without relying on "thread_created" vars?
