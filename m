[*] This demonstrates the "Note: ..." is *not* recognized as a "Note"
section before the patch (compare to the change we get for recognized
sections below).

Obscure fact: the doc parser recognizes tagged sections *only* in
definition documentation.  Arguably a misfeature.

Your series makes the misfeature even more obscure, because afterwards,
the only tagged section left that could make sense in a free-form doc
comment is "TODO".  Let's not worry about the misfeature now.

Two sensible solutions:

1. Since the patch converts tagged sections, and this isn't, don't touch
it.  If you feel you want to mention this in the commit message, go
ahead.

2. Touch it anyway.  Do mention it in the commit message then.

"Returns:" is only valid for commands, and this is a struct.  Let's use
"TODO:" instead.
