This is what you need to do if we pick solution (1).

In general, not just for your KVM PMU filter work: dropping
target-specific conditionals makes the formerly conditional things exist
for targets where they didn't exist before.  This commonly breaks the
build for these targets.  To fix a target's build, we can either
implement things for the target, or make attempts to use them fail
cleanly.

I'm afraid I don't understand your question.

Up to you.

We'll hopefully reach consensus fairly soon.  You might want to wait a
few days for that.
