Certain CPU architecture specifications [1][2][3] prohibit changes to the CPUs
*presence* after the kernel has booted. This is because many system
initializations depend on the exact CPU count at boot time and do not expect it
to change afterward. For example, components like interrupt controllers that are
closely coupled with CPUs, or various per-CPU features, may not support
configuration changes once the kernel has been initialized.

This requirement poses a challenge for virtualization features like vCPU
hotplug. To address this, changes to the ACPI AML are necessary to update the
`_STA.PRES` (presence) and `_STA.ENA` (enabled) bits accordingly during guest
initialization, as well as when vCPUs are hot-plugged or hot-unplugged. The
presence of unplugged vCPUs may need to be deliberately *simulated* at the ACPI
level to maintain a *persistent* view of vCPUs for the guest kernel.

This patch set introduces the following features:

1. ACPI Interface with Explicit PRESENT and ENABLED CPU States: It allows the
   guest kernel to evaluate these states using the `_STA` ACPI method.
   
2. Initialization of ACPI CPU States: These states are initialized during
   `machvirt_init` and when vCPUs are hot-(un)plugged. This enables hotpluggable
   vCPUs to be exposed to the guest kernel via ACPI.

3. Support for Migrating ACPI CPU States: The patch set ensures the migration of
   the newly introduced `is_{present,enabled}` ACPI CPU states to the
   destination VM.

The approach is flexible enough to accommodate ARM-like architectures that
intend to implement vCPU hotplug functionality. It is suitable for architectures
facing similar constraints to ARM or those that plan to implement vCPU
hotplugging independently of hardware support (if available).

This patch set is derived from the ARM-specific vCPU hotplug implementation [4]
and includes migration components adaptable to other architectures, following
suggestions [5] made by Igor Mammedov <imammedo@redhat.com>.

It can be applied independently, ensuring compatibility with existing hotplug
support in other architectures. I have tested this patch set in conjunction with
the ARM-specific vCPU hotplug changes (included in the upcoming RFC V5 [6]), and
everything worked as expected. I kindly request maintainers of other
architectures to provide a "Tested-by" after running their respective regression
tests.

Many thanks!
