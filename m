Thanks for confirming this, that sounds good.  I quickly discussed this
with Fabiano just now, I think there's a plan we start to mark fd migration
deprecated for the next release (9.1), then there is a chance we drop it in
migration for 9.3.  That'll copy libvirt list so we can re-check there.

Fabiano will then prepare patches to remove the "fd:" support on file
migrations; that will be for 9.0.

Thanks,
