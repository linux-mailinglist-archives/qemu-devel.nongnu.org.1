 support by reporting the VFIO_MIGRATION_PRE_COPY flag in the
 VFIO_DEVICE_FEATURE_MIGRATION ioctl.
 
+Starting from QEMU version 10.0 there's a possibility to transfer VFIO device
+_STOP_COPY state via multifd channels. This helps reduce downtime - especially
+with multiple VFIO devices or with devices having a large migration state.
+As an additional benefit, setting the VFIO device to _STOP_COPY state and
+saving its config space is also parallelized (run in a separate thread) in
+such migration mode.
+
+The multifd VFIO device state transfer is controlled by
+"x-migration-multifd-transfer" VFIO device property. This property defaults to
+AUTO, which means that VFIO device state transfer via multifd channels is
+attempted in configurations that otherwise support it.
+
+Since the target QEMU needs to load device state buffers in-order it needs to
+queue incoming buffers until they can be loaded into the device.
+This means that a malicious QEMU source could theoretically cause the target
+QEMU to allocate unlimited amounts of memory for such buffers-in-flight.
+
+The "x-migration-max-queued-buffers" property allows capping the maximum count
+of these VFIO device state buffers queued at the destination.
+
+Because a malicious QEMU source causing OOM on the target is not expected to be
+a realistic threat in most of VFIO live migration use cases and the right value
+depends on the particular setup by default this queued buffers limit is
+disabled by setting it to UINT64_MAX.
+
+Some host platforms (like ARM64) require that VFIO device config is loaded only
+after all iterables were loaded.
+Such interlocking is controlled by "x-migration-load-config-after-iter" VFIO
+device property, which in its default setting (AUTO) does so only on platforms
+that actually require it.
+
 When pre-copy is supported, it's possible to further reduce downtime by
 enabling "switchover-ack" migration capability.
 VFIO migration uAPI defines "initial bytes" as part of its pre-copy data stream
@@ -67,14 +98,39 @@ VFIO implements the device hooks for the iterative approach as follows:
 * A ``switchover_ack_needed`` function that checks if the VFIO device uses
   "switchover-ack" migration capability when this capability is enabled.
 
-* A ``save_state`` function to save the device config space if it is present.
-
-* A ``save_live_complete_precopy`` function that sets the VFIO device in
-  _STOP_COPY state and iteratively copies the data for the VFIO device until
-  the vendor driver indicates that no data remains.
-
-* A ``load_state`` function that loads the config section and the data
-  sections that are generated by the save functions above.
+* A ``switchover_start`` function that in the multifd mode starts a thread that
+  reassembles the multifd received data and loads it in-order into the device.
+  In the non-multifd mode this function is a NOP.
+
+* A ``save_state`` function to save the device config space if it is present
+  in the non-multifd mode.
+  In the multifd mode it just emits either a dummy EOS marker or
+  "all iterables were loaded" flag for configurations that need to defer
+  loading device config space after them.
+
+* A ``save_live_complete_precopy`` function that in the non-multifd mode sets
+  the VFIO device in _STOP_COPY state and iteratively copies the data for the
+  VFIO device until the vendor driver indicates that no data remains.
+  In the multifd mode it just emits a dummy EOS marker.
+
+* A ``save_live_complete_precopy_thread`` function that in the multifd mode
+  provides thread handler performing multifd device state transfer.
+  It sets the VFIO device to _STOP_COPY state, iteratively reads the data
+  from the VFIO device and queues it for multifd transmission until the vendor
+  driver indicates that no data remains.
+  After that, it saves the device config space and queues it for multifd
+  transfer too.
+  In the non-multifd mode this thread is a NOP.
+
+* A ``load_state`` function that loads the data sections that are generated
+  by the main migration channel save functions above.
+  In the non-multifd mode it also loads the config section, while in the
+  multifd mode it handles the optional "all iterables were loaded" flag if
+  it is in use.
+
+* A ``load_state_buffer`` function that loads the device state and the device
+  config that arrived via multifd channels.
+  It's used only in the multifd mode.
 
 * ``cleanup`` functions for both save and load that perform any migration
   related cleanup.
