Yes. Accepted is what we'll tolerate if it's already installed, "installed"
is what we will prefer to install.

Purely offline is my concern as it is the requirement I least understand.

For developer builds from the git tree, it doesn't matter: you have PyPI,
and we have mkvenv.py to set up an environment we are confident will work
for the purposes of building QEMU and running tests.

For package builds in foreign lands, I grow less certain ...

I know Fedora and RHEL et al build in a strictly isolated environment where
we *cannot* pull PyPI packages. For Fedora this is generally less of a
problem as the distro repository usually has bleeding edge packages for us
to use. mkvenv.py still runs in RPM builds, it just happens to not need
anything it doesn't already have, so it succeeds.

For RHEL it's slightly less of a concern as the version of QEMU packaged
tends to also be old, so the dependencies needed by that version should be
matched well by what's available in that distro repo.

Where I am less certain is for various "streams" or "modules" or whatever
for e.g. RHEL that may package newer versions of QEMU but may not have
other bleeding edge requirements. I am also entirely unfamiliar with the
release cadence of Debian, Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, etc. I am concerned
(hypothetically) about cases where Python3.9 is available as an optional
package, but newer versions of e.g. Sphinx are not.

Is that a problem? Do we care?

In theory, it could affect not just documentation building but unit tests
as well, depending on where and how we "break" our promise.

I suspect I won't really be able to figure out if it's an issue or not
until I just "yeehaw!" and do it and see who chirps, but I don't actually
like operating in such a cavalier manner as a maintainer ...

This is the problem I keep running into, generally. Our build platform
promise generally includes platforms that use EOL versions of Python by
default - which is not a problem in and of itself, however when combined
with our support for bleeding edge platforms, it becomes difficult to
support both an EOL'd version of Python *and* the latest releases, as they
are quite aggressive in dropping support for deprecated features and
libraries on the newer end.

Add to that the difficulty of keeping the linters and type checkers happy
across such a wide matrix, and it becomes burdensome to keep things
humming. In general my impression is that linters, doc systems, type
systems etc are designed to be run under strictly pinned versions, not
"whatever the user happens to have available", which is at stark odds with
how we manage our build, doc and test system environment today.

I do not know what the "solution" to that contrast is, but I do get the "we
are doing something wrong" feeling a lot when managing our stack. I am
proud it works as well as it does and across such a diverse host of
platforms, but I get the sense we're one of the few or only projects out
there doing it like this.

I would be as content as anyone else if Python didn't have such an
aggressive deprecation window and didn't *frequently* break the packaging
environment.
