I don't quite understand. Would you mind to elaborate on this?

For starters, what is the current semantic of VHOST_GET_FEATURES, and
where is it documented? You mean the ioctl, right?

Then why do you think the semantic of VHOST_GET_FEATURES should change?

IMHO changing the semantic of the VHOST_GET_FEATURES ioctl is not viable,
but also not necessary. What I am proposing is changing the (in QEMU)
logic of processing the features returned by VHOST_GET_FEATURES, while
preserving the outcomes (essentially realize the same function in a
mathematical sense, but with code that is less fragile), modulo bugs like
the one addressed with this patch of course.

Halil
