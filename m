Yes, there could be further types of blocker.

Do you have an example of something that would be a CPR blocker
only ?


I was thinking that migration blockers have a functional classification
which motivates their existance.

The different migration modes are describing particular usage
scenarios, and a given usage scenario will imply blockers for
one or more functional reasons.

Sure, I didn't mean to suggest "mode" as an input to 'migrate'
is bad. Just that I see migration blockers classification as
being distinct from the 'mode'. So a user could specify 'mode'
with 'migrate'  and that ends up mapping to certain types of
blocker.

I guess I could see wanting to use --only-migratable to express that I
want a guest that can do a localhost-migration, and CPR, but don't
care about cross-host-migration, which would point towards blocker
types being exposed.
