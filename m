The instance lifecycle and the memory allocation is managed by the same 
object (i.e., the owner). When the owner is being finalized, the owner 
performs the following operations in order in object_finalize():

1. Unparent all children.
2. Call the instance_finalize() callback.

We can say the timing is "split", but the split timing exists even 
without this patch; unparenting happens before instance_finalize(), 
which calls g_free(), with or without this patch. Fixing the split 
timing can be done later.

It makes sense to have a through review, but my argument here is the 
de-duplication of object_unparent() and the replacement of g_free() with 
object_new() are logically distinct and should be split into distinct 
patches. Each patch can independently have through review, be 
applied/backported, or be reverted in case of regression.
