Let me add some perspective...

Current docs/sphinx/qapidoc.py is 370 SLOC.  In my experience, it
resists improvement pretty hard, by Sphinx throwing impenetrable stack
traces at the slightest provocation.

Your replacement, which generated *much* superior rendered documentation
is how much, not counting compatibility goop?

The compatibility goop adds how much?

As far as I know, the replacement proper is nice, maintainable code,
while the goop is, well, goop.  Anything breaks there, we run for the
hills and wait for the John Snow cavalry to save the day.

Double-checking I understand what you wrote:

* We support Python 3.8 and later.

  3.8 was released in 2019, upstream full support ended in 2021, and
  security fixes are about to end.

  docs/about/build-platforms.rst claims 3.7.  I'll fix it.

* We support Meson 1.1.0 and later.

  If the system doesn't provide, we fall back to bundled Meson 1.2.3.

* We support Sphinx 3.4.3 or later.

  If the system doesn't provide, we pull one from PyPI with
  --enable-docs, else disable docs.  Which version do we pull?

  There's a check for >=1.7.0 in docs/meson.build.  Could that go?

* We support sphinx-rtd-theme.

  Does it come with Sphinx?

Loaded question, but I know you can answer this better than I could: how
common is it to support a wide range of versions for Python tools?
