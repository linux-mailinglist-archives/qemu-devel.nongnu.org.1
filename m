Yeah... We used the "stable" from master. That is our mistake there.

I'm pretty sure we targeted the 0.13. The "Sdtrig" was only added in
the v4 as the changelog says: "mention Sdtrig extension in the commit"

We can't deprecate a ratified spec. The 0.13 just seems to call it
"debug" so that's what we are stuck with

We will need to support two versions, as there are two ratified specs.
