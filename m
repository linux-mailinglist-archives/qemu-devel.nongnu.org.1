I see, this is also a typical effort to eliminate unsafe crossing of FFI
boundaries.

Further, what about doing object_unref() in object_property_add_child()
or object_property_try_add_child()?

Then we can ensure the object will have ref count of 1 on the exit of
object_property_add_child() and people will no longer miss
object_unref().

Although, there are a few more devices involved to fix similar issues.

Thanks, the whole picture is nice.

Elegant code design, looking forward to pin_init.

Thank you :-) It seems virtio device will have an embedded case to adopt
Child<> struct (virtio_instance_init_common()).
