Like you, I don't care much about the ICH9 device. However it seemed
a complex-enough chipset worth trying to model it right with QDev so
we could then split the code in QOM Properties / QDev API / real
implementation to prototype a DSL, generate the QDev boiler plate and
keep the implementation part. Again, price worth to spend a bit in
order to get something simpler later.
