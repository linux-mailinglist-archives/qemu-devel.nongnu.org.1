Why doesn't file=fat: imply format=vvfat? For what is the fat: part in 
file then? I currently recommend using:

-drive if=none,id=ufat,format=raw,file=fat:rw:/dir/to/export
-device usb-storage,drive=ufat

to my users which I got from somewhere but don't remember where and it 
seems to work but maybe not the best way to specify this. After reading 
this thread I'm confused about how to use this correctly. Is there some 
documentation on this? There only seems to be some mentions in 
docs/system/qemu-block-drivers.rst.inc but all of them using older 
options:

   |qemu_system| linux.img -hdb fat:/my_directory
   |qemu_system| linux.img -fda fat:floppy:/my_directory
   |qemu_system| linux.img -fda fat:floppy:rw:/my_directory
