Hi Christian,

I think the timer based mode works fine. snd_pcm_readi() and
snd_pcm_writei() return -EPIPE in case of a xrun and -ESTRPIPE if a
suspend event occurred. Both cases are handled in alsa_write(). The
-ESTRPIPE case is missing in alsa_read(), which may be a mistake. I
don't think it's possible alsa_read() and alsa_write() get called if the
ALSA system is in state SND_PCM_STATE_SETUP.

The write_loop() example code at
https://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/alsa-lib/examples.html in file
test/pcm.c also doesn't use the snd_pcm_state() function. Please have a
look at write_loop() in test/pcm.c and compare it with
write_and_poll_loop() in the same file.

With best regards
Volker
