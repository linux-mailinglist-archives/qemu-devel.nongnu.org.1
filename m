It is also configurable via rsetsockopt() SO_SNDBUF.  Both of those are similar to TCP settings.  The SW field used to store this value is 32-bits.

Is it possible to make rsocket be friendly with large buffers (>4GB) like
the VM use case?

I also wonder whether there're other applications that may benefit from
this outside of QEMU.
