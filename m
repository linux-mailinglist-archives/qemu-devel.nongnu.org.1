Conceptually this is similar to BSD-3-Clause-Modification, but the
actual text of the license does not match

  https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause-Modification.html

so IMHO we can't claim this is BSD-3-Clause-Modification currently.

IIUC, it would have to be submitted to SPDX for review to decide
whether it needs to be a new license, or whether the permitted text
for BSD-3-Clause-Modification can allow a choice of matches.

Yep, makes sense.
