IIUC, the problem you're concerned with is that 'make check SPEED=thorough'
is running too much, and you want to stop running skipped tests directly.

My view is that running "make check SPEED=thorough" is undesirable in
general, even before either of our patch series. I'd say it is almost
never what people actually want to use, and is only picked because of
the lack of a better option. That's why I thought 'make check-block-qed'
(and equiva for other formats) was a better option, as it gives a make
target that matches a specific testing use case. With that in mind, IMHO
it is less important if 'make check SPEED=thorough' waste a bit of time
launched irrelevant tests.

Yes, technically there are two distinct axis  formats vs protocols, but
from the POV of running the 'check' script the boundary is rather blurred.

You can run './check -nbd' and './check -qcow2', or both combined. The main
limit that you can only pick a single format and single protocol at a time.

IMHO for test suites it is preferrable to keep a flat namespace, rather
than creating a matrix of suites for protocol vs format combniations.

Perhaps the meson.build variable should just be renamed from _formats
to something else.

With regards,
Daniel
