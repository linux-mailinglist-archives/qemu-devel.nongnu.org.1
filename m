Whether the blob is in a read-only segment or not isn't important,
because it transits writable memory in the QMP command marshalling.

IOW, if we're trying to mitigate against compromised QEMU, we
*must* fetch it before vCPUs are started. If we're super paranoid,
we would want to fetch it before even opening untrusted disk images
too.  It might push towards fetching it while probing capabilities
from a throw-away QEMU with "-m none"
