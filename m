The intention was to print a warning to tell users PDCM cannot be 
enabled if pmu is not enabled. While mark_unavailable_features() does 
has the effect of setting the bit in cpu->filtered_features[].

But the feature is masked off anyway even without the 
mark_unavailable_features():

     env->features[FEAT_1_ECX] &= ~CPUID_EXT_PDCM;

So is it that PDCM is set in cpu->filtered_features[] causing the problem?
