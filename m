Right, my above statement was definitely inaccurate.

After merging caps and params we only have params.  We should only allow
some params to be changed anytime.  Most of the params (including caps)
should not allow changing during migration live on either src/dst.

IIUC that's what migration_is_running() about?

It's a matter of if such finer granularity is necessary for us. Let's
assume the simple scheme is:

  (a) Some params are allowed to be modified anytime, examples,
      downtime-limit, max-bandwidth, max-postcopy-bandwidth, etc.

  (b) All the rest params and all capabilities are not allowed to be modified
      when migration_is_running() returns true (my fixed version above)

The whitelisted (a) should really be the smallest set of params, and
justified one by one or it should fall into (b).

My hope is the simple scheme should work for us already.  After merging
caps, it's only about some params that can be set anytime, rest params can
only be set when migration is not running.

Any example you can think of, that above simple scheme won't work for us?

I didn't follow as closely on the discussion there.  I don't know if
changing MigrationStatus is a good idea..  we should have some really good
reason to make libvirt and all mgmt need a change.. but maybe I misread the
discussion.  I can wait until I read something solid if Prasad is going to
propose something.

Yeah..  When merging state, we'll also need to be careful on overlapped
fields, e.g. expecting a COMPLETED state (from a completed incoming
migration) when starting a new outgoing migration.

We can likely leave this for later.
