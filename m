I decided not to.

String is used for NetdevUserOptions members @dnssearch, @hostfwd, and
@guestfwd.  NetdevUserOptions are the type-specific arguments of
netdev-add with type "user".

@dnssearch is documented tolerably well, although there's less
information than for the CLI equivalent in qemu-options.hx.

@hostfwd is not: the string format is not documented at all.  It's its
own mini-language.  The CLI equivalent in qemu-options.hx documents it.

Of course, encoding information in strings like that is bad practice in
QMP.  Probably not worth fixing now.

Same for @guestfwd.

These documentation deficiencies are more serious than the "Not
documented" for String.  Only fixing the latter seems not worthwhile.

Jason, thoughts?
