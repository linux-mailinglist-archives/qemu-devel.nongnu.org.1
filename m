Plan A: catch it in review.  If that turns out to be overly bothersome,
we need to think about better tooling.

I've since pondered this some more, and also talked with John.

When doc comments look like they provide a certain kind of information,
but they are actually unrealiable, that's less than ideal for its
readers.

This has always been the case for member / argument descriptions.  We
didn't require them initially, and when we started to, things had gotten
so bad that I had to provide an escape hatch: pragma
documentation-exceptions still lists 44 offenders in qapi/ and one in
qga/.

Most of the offenders are doc bugs.  But not all: documenting the
members of QKeyCode one by one would be silly.

It has also always been the case for return value descriptions.  We
still don't require them.  Your series uncovered ten in qapi/ and one in
qga/.  Your series adds 46 in qapi/.  Possibly more after review of the
last patch.  Missing Returns goes from rare to common.

This does not create doc bugs.  Generated documentation actually
improves.

I figure developers just have to mind that the doc comment need not be
complete.

The non-plaintext sections are: Returns, Errors, Since, TODO.

Returns and Errors are reliable anchors for the inliner.  The inliner
inlines argument sections.  They need to go next to Returns / Errors
sections, if any, because they get rendered together in as single
two-column thing.

Since feels useless as an anchor.  Does the inline ignore it?  I don't
remember.  Every definition doc should have it, and we commonly put it
at the very end (currently 776 out of 984 times).  When we don't, it's
usually followed by examples only, and occasionally by notes.  Putting
it always last would be better.  If we manage to replace handwritten by
computed since information, Since goes away.

TODO is the odd duck.  It can go anywhere, which makes its use as anchor
questionable.  It's rare (I count 7 instances).  One of them presses it
into service to separate intro and example (commit 14b48aaab92).  Your
inliner series has a replacement for this hack; I believe the
replacement can serve as a reliable anchor.

This is a heuristic.  We'll discuss it in review of the inliner.

I'd be interested in the existing instances if you can track them down
easily.
