I think you are attaching a little too much weight to a r-b tag here as
no one was suggesting the patch go in via a different tree. Ultimately
the maintainer can always NACK a reviewed patch.=20

Maybe more useful would be re-wording the comment:

  /* Merge multiple uses of option into a single list? */

to be explicit about its behaviour.=20

I think that's a fairly subjective requirement for something that
generally we can always use more of. I encourage people to review all
around the code base to get familiar with new sub-systems. I don't think
we should be dissuading people from exploring outside their silos. That
simple one liners can trip people up says more about the code than the
reviewer.

I sympathise with Philippe here who's current brief takes him around our
large and interconnected code base more than most.
