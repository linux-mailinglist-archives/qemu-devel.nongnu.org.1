It's not purely that I want to appease Coverity. I also
think for human readers that the current trick with passing
back a pointer into host memory and relying on being able to
get back to either the MR or to the bounce-buffer struct
from that is pretty tricky. Would we have designed it that
way if we weren't starting with the pre-existing address_space_map()
function signature?
