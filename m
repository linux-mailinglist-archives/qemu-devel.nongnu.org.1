s/if let/let else/

"only occurs in a dependency" is probably not the right argument while
we haven't really started writing our own Rust code. If it were
available, we would probably use it in new code. But even without that,
the conclusion is the same, of course: This doesn't prevent implementing
anything and is far from being a show stopper.

I'm in favour of anything that lets up keep the phase of duplication as
short as possible if it doesn't severly limit what we can do. And I
don't see anything in this series that would do that.

If configure errors out with a message "Please run 'cargo install
bindgen-cli'" and that is really enough to make it build, I think that
should be enough to be counted as supporting the distro.
