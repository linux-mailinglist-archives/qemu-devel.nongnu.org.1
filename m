Excellent!

I think that is a reasonable limitation as we don't expect people
to do that crazy on QMP side.   Maybe long term we'll want a
'release all' type command (I'm thinking virtualized device usecases)
but we can deal with that later.

Ah. I missed this mail and replied directly.  That needs a rethink
as the thread has concluded I think. I'll carry it on my tree, but not
look to upstream it.

Sorry for slow reply - I'm a bit behind with mailing lists.
Great you sent it out in the meantime.
