It just means that the contents are entirely implementation
defined, so you can't tell what they mean unless you first
look at MIDR_EL1 to find out what your implementation is.

(Linux doesn't appear to ever look at the AFR0 registers.)

There's support in the KVM GET_ONE_REG API for reading
and writing the full array (see KVM_REG_ARM_DEMUX_ID_CCSIDR).
We just don't bother in QEMU at the moment because we never
need the values in userspace.

That seems like a missing feature in KVM -- it ought to be
implemented on anything where ID_AA64MMFR2.CCIDX says
we have FEAT_CCIDX (which means that the whole cache ID
format changes and the info is split between CCSIDR
and CCSIDR2).

Probably because KVM doesn't have support for SME in
guests yet ?

The hardware handles it for you -- inside the guest, the
value of the DZP bit depends on HCR_EL2.TDZ (and maybe also
SCTLR_EL1.DZE). The value of DCZID_EL0.BS has to match the
real host CPU anyway because you can't change the block
size that the DC ZVA insn is going to use. (You could
trap DCZID_EL0 accesses via HFGRTR_EL2.DCZID_EL0 if you really
wanted to, but you'd also need to trap-and-emulate the
DC ZVA insns, which is a lot of effort for something
no guest is really going to notice the difference on.)
