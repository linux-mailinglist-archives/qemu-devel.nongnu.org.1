Per Michal:

   Truth is that I am not aware about anybody configuring MB to big
   endian and we  are on AXI for quite a long time. There is still
   code in Linux kernel for it but I can't see any reason to keep it
   around. I don't think that make sense to keep big endian
   configurations alive at all.

So with that in mind, using a default of little-endian=true for
MicroBlaze seems safe as of 2025.

For MIPS, big-endian was the default but as the industry shifted,
it stayed big-endian on low-end 32-bit cores but mostly became
little-endian on high-end 64-bit cores.

For Renesas RX, the "Endian" section in the "CPU" chapter of the
hardware manual mentions:

   Both big and little endian are supported for the treatment of data,
   and the endian is switched by changing the setting on a mode pin (MDE)
   at the time of a power-on reset.

SH-4 "is bi-endian, running in either big-endian or little-endian byte
ordering."
