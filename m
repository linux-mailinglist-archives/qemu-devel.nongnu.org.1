I'm not sure why the action is defined to event scope instead of the entire
filter scope. At least for x86 arch, the action is defined to filter scope
in KVM. Do other archs support event scope's action? If the action can be
defined to filter scope, the code could be simplified much.

Per my understanding, the cpus sharing same uarch should share same perf
events filter. Not sure if there is real requirement to support different
filters on the CPUs with same arch.
