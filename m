I haven't missed it but I did not have time to test and review it yet. I 
hoped somebody else could also help out but I still intend to review it 
when I have more time. For the CCE I've restored the ticket I got about it 
before here: https://codeberg.org/qmiga/pages/issues/3 which has the info 
I've collected so far that may help but I could not find info on the 
microcode of these older ATI cards, Only newer versions seem to be known 
that are linked in the ticket. So unless you can find out how it works the 
way to go may be to parse the packets directly the same way as Xenia 
emulator does and not trying to run the microcode but it would be nice to 
emulate the micro engine if the microcode can be reversed or understood 
enough. Newer versions of the microcode appear to have short segments for 
each packet type that do simple operations, mainly stuffing data in the 
command FIFO so that FIFO may also need to be implemented first then 
another possible improvement is to run the drawing engine in a separate 
thread asynchronously fed through the command FIFO as it works on the real 
chip.

BALATON Zoltan
