I'm not clear how this is different from pxb-pcie where we do have
the _DSM. Both are pretending to be real host bridges.

Ok.  My original motivation for _DSM on CXL was function 5 to stop Linux messing up
the reenumeration which I know has been rejected upstream for a bunch of
compatibility reasons.  Anyhow, that's a future problem.
