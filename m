Yes, I prefer this.  Here's why.

Error recovery that is unreachable now but might become reachable at
some future time is untestable now.  Mind, this does not necessarily
make it a bad idea by itself.  But there's more.

Anything that makes this error recovery reachable either breaks it or
makes correctness locally unobvious.  Why?  To make it reachable, plug /
unplug must be able to fail on the happy path.  But then they either can
fail on the error recovery path as well (which breaks error recovery),
or they can't fail there for reasons that are not locally obvious.

This sets a trap for readers.  An attentive reader will see the problem
(like I did), but to see why the code is not broken right now will take
digging (like we did together).  And after such digging, we're left with
a queasy feeling about robustness of the code (like we are now).

Passing &error_abort on the happy path avoids all this.  Instead it
clearly tells the reader that this is not expected to fail.

If failure becomes possible at some future time, this should crash in
testing.  If we neglect to test the new failure (and we really
shouldn't), we crash on error in production right away instead of
risking botched error recovery messing up the program's state.
Both are bad outcomes, but which one's less bad I find impossible to
predict.
