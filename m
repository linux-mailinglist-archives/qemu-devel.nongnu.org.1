Hi Pierrick,

I've just submitted a new SMMU test device that enables qtest-based 
testing without needing to boot any kernel or firmware. You can find the 
patch here:

https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2025-09/msg05366.html


I wanted to send a special thank you for your suggestion to use qtest. 
It was a pivotal piece of advice that unblocked this entire effort.

To give you some context, my initial approach was much more complex. 
Based on the method we discussed earlier 
([https://github.com/hnusdr/qemu/tree/smmuv3-test-device]), I had added 
a new memory map in virt.c and heavily modified the SMMU code to create 
a non-standard platform device. This setup was coupled with the Hafnium 
firmware for testing, which was clearly not a sustainable long-term 
solution.

My next idea was to create a self-contained device using QMP to make 
test easier. It was at that point you suggested I look into qtest, and 
that's when I realized qtest already works on the exact QMP mechanism I 
was considering. That was the missing piece for me, and it directly led 
to this new test device patch.

If you or others have a moment, I would greatly appreciate any review or 
feedback on whether this test device is a suitable approach for our 
testing needs.

Thanks again for your invaluable guidance.

Best,
Tao
