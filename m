<Just some rough thoughts/understanding>

Yes, Timer requires Pin<> and it seems MemoryRegion also should requires
it because of callback...

MemoryRegion requires MaybeUninitField, but it would be not necessary
for HPET, since HPETTimer has already initialized its other field before
calling init_full(). But as a general interface, MaybeUninitField could
be also useful for Timer, as we can't require how device initialize its
field.

Clock's ParentInit<> is also different. We don't need to require
Timer::init_full must be called in init(). MemoryRegion may also don't
need it And some C device even calls memory_region_init_io() in
realize().
