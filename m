And you have a simulated BMC that can do this?  Or is the system running
in qemu the BMC.

The aspeed i2c controller is capable of having another bus master on an
I2C but, but it is the only host that can currently do it.

It is doable, the code is ther for multiple bus masters, but there is no
device currently that does it.  I assume that is coming at some point,
but no documentation exists on how to do it.

You can look at the git commits in hw/i2c around 37fa5ca42623 "hw/i2c:
support multiple masters" for the changes that were done to support
this.

I haven't done it, and I don't remember exactly how it works.

You have a lot more to learn than this to make a qemu device.  And i2c
bus mastering in qemu is pretty esoteric, not many people know anything
about it.
