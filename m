If changing the @model value directly, it will introduce user visible 
change. E.g., live migrating from old QEMU to new QEMU, the guest will 
find the model number changes.

That's why versioned CPU model was introduced. It becomes the fact 
already that YongFeng-v1 has model id 11 and broken vpmu. If user create 
vcpu with YongFeng-v1, user has to accept it. If user wants a working 
vpmu, go and use YongFeng-v2
