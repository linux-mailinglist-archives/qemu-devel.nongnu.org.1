Well, so far we've established that we need a "WAKEUP" reset
type, but not that we need a "WARM" reset type. The latter
would be something we'd need to trigger for quite a lot of
reset-causes where we currently default to COLD reset, so
I don't think we should do that until we need it.

If suspend-and-wakeup really is supposed to be a reset event
on some machines but not on others, that sounds unhelpfully
nonstandard, but then hardware designers rarely make choices
to make our lives easier :-) And yes, we should make sure
that's clear in the documentation.

I think with adding new reset events it's going to be
important that we're clear about what they are (and in
particular what the triggering events that cause them
are) so that we have a solid guide for what it means.
The thing in particular I'm hoping to avoid here is that
we vaguely define, for example, a "warm" reset type and then
different parts of the system interpret "warm" in different
ways.

thanks
