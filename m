Fair.

(It's about a decade since I did any serious Colo, so I'll try and remember)

In reality misalignments are actually pretty common - although it's
very workload dependent.  Any randomness in the order of execution in a multi-threaded
guest for example, or when a timer arrives etc can change the packet generation.
The migration time then becomes a latency issue before you can
transmit the mismatched packet once it's detected.

I think You still need to send a regular stream of snapshots even without
having *yet* received a packet difference.  Now, I'm trying to remember the
reasoning; for a start if you leave the difference too long the migration
snapshot gets larger (which I think needs to be stored on RAM on the dest?)
and also you increase the chances of them getting a packet difference from
randomness increases.
I seem to remember there were clever schemes to get the optimal snapshot
scheme.

There's more than one critical path:
  a) Time to recovery when one host fails
  b) Overhead when both hosts are happy.

I can't remember where the COLO code got into the main migration paths;
is that the reception side storing the received differences somewhere else?

Haha yes.
