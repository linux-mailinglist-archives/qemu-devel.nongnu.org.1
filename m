Right, the problem is that for a while we'll have 3 buckets of
stuff (insecure, secure and "not sure yet"), when ideally we would
only have two buckets (insecure, secure).

I agree that for people running VMs, ideally require-secure=yes is
what they should be using.

The "not sure yet" bucket is a bit like schrodinger's cat in a box.

If we only had require-secure=yes, and that was insufficient for
the user, they'd be left with no way to exclude stuff that is
/definitely/ insecure. The prohibit-insecure=yes is at least
telling them they're not using something that is a terribly
bad idea.

In practice most of the stuff in the 'not sure yet' bucket will
be stuff that you'll only want to use in combniation with TCG,
and thus your VM will be in the 'insecure' bucket anyway.

There is a 2nd less critical use case for prohibit-insecure=yes
in relation to security report triage.

If someone submits a security report and it relies on a config
that is blocked by prohibit-insecure=yes, then we can categorically
declare it out of scope for CVE handling.

Similarly the require-secure=yes is categorically in-scope.

The 'do not bucket' is where we have to do case-by-case
analysis of the reoprt to decide whether it is in scope or
not.

Maybe the right answer is to just declare everything insecure
by default and focus on just annotating stuff for the secure
bucket as quickly as possible.

The lazy option would be to take everything that is built in
a RHEL distro build and label it as secure. We know Red Hat
is already on the hook for fixing CVEs in any such component
and sending fixes upstream. So by following the RHEL allow
list initially we should be implying any new burden for the
upstream. 

That would enable require-secure=yes for a useful amount of
code needed for secure KVM guests on x86, s390x, aarch64,
ppc64 and perhaps riscv.

Oh I forgot about -compat entirely. That does indeed feel like
a better place.

Yep that works, and is already reporting the 'abstract' property
so putting a'secure' property alongside fits nicely.
