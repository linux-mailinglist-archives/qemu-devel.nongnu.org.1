Sweep the entire documentation again.  Last done in commit
01bed0ff14b (qapi: Refill doc comments to conform to conventions).

To check the generated documentation does not change, I compared the
generated HTML before and after this commit with "wdiff -3".  Finds no
differences.  Comparing with diff is not useful, as the reflown
paragraphs are visible there.
