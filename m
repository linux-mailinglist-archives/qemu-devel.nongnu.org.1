Nop; that's totally ok.

Yes please.

I also wonder whether it'll be good to update the uAPI header too in Linux,
for vfio_device_feature_mig_data_size or VFIO_DEVICE_FEATURE_MIG_DATA_SIZE.
Currently it reads a bit ambiguous to me, while it could make a huge
difference iiuc when precopy size is non-trivial.

/*
 * Upon VFIO_DEVICE_FEATURE_GET read back the estimated data length that will
 * be required to complete stop copy.
 *
 * Note: Can be called on each device state.
 */

Maybe that'll also be helpful when other drivers will implement this, then
just to make sure both side (user / kernel) are crystal clear on the
definition.
