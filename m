True.

My two example messages are differently generic :)

The first tells a user nothing, and a developer which function failed.
It doesn't tell what failed.  If we're lucky, only one thing can fail
this way, so finding it is easy enough.  Are we feeling lucky?

The second tells both of them what failed, but doesn't tell the
developer how exactly it failed.

No objection at all as long as the message remains useful to the users.
Remember, this kind of warning is for users first, developers second.
Warnings about bugs are the other way round.

I'm not following.  error_prepend() doesn't care how the error it
modifies will be consumed.  The following should just work:

    error_setg(errp, "failed to WSAEventSelect: %s", WSAGetLastError())
    ... up the stack some ...
    error_prepend(errp, "unable to initialize slirp user mode networking")
    ... up the stack some more ...
    warn_report_err(err);

We even have a convenience function to warn with prepended text:

    error_setg(errp, "failed to WSAEventSelect: %s", WSAGetLastError())
    ... up the stack some ...
    warn_reportf_err(err, "unable to initialize slirp user mode networking:=
 ")
