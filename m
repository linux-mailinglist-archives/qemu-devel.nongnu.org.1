Stefan, Thank you for the quick response and great information!

I'm not sure if this is the best way, but I was able to get things
working today using the coroutine approach.

Now, the aforementioned stack looks like this:

IOReadHandler callback receives request
  enters coroutine
    calls address_space_ldq_be()
      resolves to mmio read op of a remote device
        sends request
over socket
        detects coroutine context and
        calls qemu_coroutine_yield() instead of blocking
  returns to callback 

<time passes>

IOReadHandler callback receives response
  re-enters coroutine
        mmio read op returns data received in response message
    address_space_ldq_be() returns
  coroutine completes and returns to callback

While this works, I couldn't help but notice that the coroutine concept
seems to be like a form of multithreading.  Is there some advantage to
using coroutines over doing the work in another thread?  Does QEMU
offer an interface that allows for a callback to queue up work that can
be handled by another thread or a pool of threads?

Thanks,

Glenn Miles
