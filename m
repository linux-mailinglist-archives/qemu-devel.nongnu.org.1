Yeah, I think you are right Volker. The already existing -EPIPE and -ESTRPI=
PE
error cases should handle the "xrun" and "suspended" conditions equivalently
in poll mode.

Agreed, -ESTRPIPE is missing in alsa_read(), and -EBADF (audio device in
invalid state) is missing in both alsa_read() and alsa_write(). That could
probably happen when you unplug an USB audio device. On macOS applications
also need to recover when plugging in/out headphones, but IIRC that's not
necessary with ALSA.

Well, I wouldn't say it's exactly the same thing to experience a misbehavio=
ur
with a specific, custom supplied option vs. experiencing the misbehaviour w=
hen
running with default options. And I am pretty sure you know why. ;-)

But anyway, I won't object this change:

A suspend condition is simply putting the host machine asleep, i.e. closing
the lid of your Linux notebook, or selecting suspend from the menu of your
desktop environment.

=46or testing for xruns (a.k.a. buffer overrun / buffer underrun) you could
simply insert a short sleep in the render code to simulate the audio render
function to take too long to deliver the audio data to the ALSA subsystem.

In both cases QEMU should recover audio. If it doesn't, you will simply
continue to hear silence with QEMU for good.
