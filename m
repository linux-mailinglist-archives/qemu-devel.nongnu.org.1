It's weird to add a flag that users can set to 'off' and nothing happens.

That said, I'm considering profile disablement a debug/development option.
I am thinking about adding a warning when users disables a profile like:

"disabling a profile is recommended only for troubleshooting and is discouraged
for regular use"

And also mention something along those lines in the docs as well.

We might be compelled into implementing profile disablement because it's weird
otherwise, but we're not obligated to promote it. In fact I want to actively
discourage it.


Thanks,

Daniel
