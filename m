I think this option is best. We have two code paths - 'uri' and
'MigrateChannel', we we just need coverage of that new path.
So modifying some of the existing test cases to use MigrateChannel
gives us that coverage without harming existing coverage. This is
more time efficient than adding extra tests.

I don't think so. When using the legacy 'uri' syntax (which all tests
already do), we convert to MigrateChannel internally, then the rest
of migration uses the MigrateChannel.  IOW, we already have coverage
of unix/fd/etc.

All we're lacking is validation that the very first entrypoint allows
MigrateChannel. We can prove that with a single test that uses
MigrateChannel

Yes, its a worthwhile sanity check. There are a few intentional
failure tests in migrate-test.c.

> 4. Is there updated document in Qemu to follow latest practices on how to write migration tests?

Not that I know of
