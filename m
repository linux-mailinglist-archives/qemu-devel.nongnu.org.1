Libvirt should support recovery, while vhost-user should also be supported
in general by both qemu/libvirt.  Huge page is indeed still the issue,
though.

Yeah, that's OK.

That'll be my take on this, so we can keep relatively focused for hopefully
all migration developers around QEMU in the near future.  I wonder this
could be a good measure so we at least try to reduce part of the burden.

I don't think it's a published rule, it's just something I thought about
when glancing your series.  So feel free to share your thoughts.  Btw I'll
not be able to read into details yet in the next few days due to flooded
inbox.. sorry for that.  But I'll come back after I flush the rest.
