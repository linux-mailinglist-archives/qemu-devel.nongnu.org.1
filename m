My understanding is that vDPA is still a quite special device, assuming
only targeting advanced users, and should not appear in a default config
for anyone.  It means the user should hopefully remove the device if the
guest is not using it, instead of worrying on a slow boot.

Is that a major issue for us?  IIUC then VFIO shares the same condition.
If it's a real problem, do we want to have a solution that works for both
(or, is it possible)?

I think even if vDPA decides to use a thread, we should keep the same
behavior before/after the migration.  Having assymetric behavior over DMA
from the assigned HWs might have unpredictable implications.

What I worry is we may over-optimize / over-engineer the case where the
user will specify the vDPA device but not use it, as I mentioned above.

For the long term, maybe there's chance to optimize DMA pinning for both
vdpa/vfio use cases, then we can always pin them during VM starts? Assuming
that issue only exists for large VMs, while they should normally be good
candidates for huge pages already.  Then, it means maybe one folio/page can
cover a large range (e.g. 1G on x86_64) in one pin, and physical continuity
also provides possibility of IOMMU large page mappings.  I didn't check at
which stage we are for VFIO on this, Alex may know better. I'm copying Alex
anyway since the problem seems to be a common one already, so maybe he has
some thoughts.

Thanks,
