Daniel, you have a very good point here.

I just collected the first version of Richard's fixes (with Phil's
changes and tags), added them to qemu debian package and pushed that
one out, - debian has much wider CI than qemu has, hopefully it will
clear things out.

Also I pushed them to staging-8.1 branch for qemu ci run.  This obviously
should not go to current stable-8.1 since these fixes aren't in master.

The only thing I regret is that his simple thing didn't occur to me
much earlier (and actually didn't occur to me at all).

Let's see..

As it turns out, quite a lot of various CI stuff uses qemu in tcg
mode behind the scenes.

This does not seem to be practical.  I did find commit which broke (some)
things, but it isn't easy to revert it now.  IIRC anyway.

Thank you for the excellent hint!
