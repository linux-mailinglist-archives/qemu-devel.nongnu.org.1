It's a good question, to which I didn't really spend time thinking of, 
mainly because I prefer to stay focus on achieving a single-binary 
having a *single-target* available at runtime first.

Once we have this, which should be a "zero effect" change, I think we'll 
be ready to discuss how the monitor and QEMU command line should be 
affected by heterogeneous emulation.

I feel that several people expressed their desire to create a new and 
minimal command line/monitor for this new heterogeneous scenario.

IMHO, I would prefer to see things going towards the direction of having 
a "main" target, and secondaries targets available at runtime. 
Basically, for a aarch64/microblaze mixed board, it would be the same as 
enhancing qemu-system-aarch64, with microblaze cpus available. 
Eventually, we can add specific options/monitor commands associated to 
this, but I'm not sure that refactoring the whole thing is the good way 
to go.
That said, my experience on such usages, and on QEMU in general, is much 
more limited than all the people here, so I would be happy to listen and 
follow what they will design and implement.
It's just my personal software engineer alarm which gets triggered when 
I hear "Let's create another new way to access this", when we are not 
even sure at this point of how many heterogenous boards we'll have in 
the next 10 years. Maybe heterogenenous scenarios will concern only a 
few exotic boards, and it would not be worth buying new shiny wheels for 
the QEMU car ahead of this. Just my two cents.

In all cases, my current focus is to be able to compile and link such a 
binary, without which we can't do any step further.

Regards,
Pierrick
