There's a few things that may happen to help drive rust. People
have written a few things in rust that they hope to make default
once FreeBSD finishes its transition to pkgbase (though that's some
time in the future). There's also a desire to experiment with rust drivers
in the kernel for more fringe features to see if that helps us get done
faster.

Yes. I believe we build those today.

I expect it to mostly work, most of the time, to be honest on FreeBSD. I
also
expect there to be more breakage than we see with llvm/clang...

So the bottom line should be that we'll be able to make it work, but there
is likely going to be more work since rust is less mature than C. However,
it's not clear if this is an occasional minor thing, or if it becomes major
and
frequent. And the only way to know that is to take the plunge, so don't
let this stop your plans.
