I agree with Rick in that having QEMU treat them as configurable is going t=
o be
a disaster.  But I don't think it's actually problematic in practice.

If QEMU (or KVM) has no visibility into the state of the guest's view of th=
e
affected features, then it doesn't matter whether they are fixed or configu=
rable.
They're effectively Schr=C3=B6dinger's bits: until QEMU/KVM actually looks =
at them,
they're neither dead nor alive, and since QEMU/KVM *can't* look at them, wh=
o cares?

So, if the TDX Module *requires* them to be set/cleared when the TD is crea=
ted,
then they should be reported as fixed.  If the TDX module doesn't care, the=
n they
should be reported as configurable.  The fact that the guest can muck with =
things
under the hood doesn't factor into that logic.

If TDX pulls something like this for features that KVM cares about, then we=
 have
problems, but that's already true today.  If a feature requires KVM support=
, it
doesn't really matter if the feature is fixed or configurable.  What matter=
s is
that KVM has a chance to enforce that the feature can be used by the guest =
if
and only if KVM has the proper support in place.  Because if KVM is complet=
ely
unaware of a feature, it's impossible for KVM to know that the feature need=
s to
be rejected.

This isn't unique to TDX, CoCo, or firmware.  Every new feature that lands =
in
hardware needs to either be "benign" or have the appropriate virtualization
controls.  KVM already has to deal with cases where features can effectivel=
y be
used without KVM's knowledge.  E.g. there are plenty of instruction-level
virtualization holes, and SEV-ES doubled down by essentially forcing KVM to=
 let
the guest write XCR0 and XSS directly.

It all works, so long as the hardware vendor doesn't screw up and let the g=
uest
use a feature that impacts host safety and/or functionality, without the hy=
pervisor's
knowledge.

So, just don't screw up :-)
