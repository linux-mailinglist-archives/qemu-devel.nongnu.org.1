Let me summarize:
CPU accesses bad memory on CXL device, then
-> MCE (INT18), *always* report (1)
-> * FW-First (implemented)
      -> CXL device -> FW -> OS:ACPI->APEI->GHES -> MCE (2)
    * OS-First (not implemented yet, I'm working on it)
      -> CXL device -> MSI -> OS:CXL driver -> memory_failure() (2)
Then (1) and (2) are duplicated.

Looking forward your comment.  Thanks in advance!
