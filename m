I added "vhost=off" to -netdev tap in L0's qemu command. I followed all
the steps in the blog [1] up till the point where L2 is booted. Before
booting L2, I had no issues pinging L0 from L1.

For each ping, the following trace lines were printed by QEMU:

virtqueue_alloc_element elem 0x5d041024f560 size 56 in_num 0 out_num 1
virtqueue_pop vq 0x5d04109b0ce8 elem 0x5d041024f560 in_num 0 out_num 1
virtqueue_fill vq 0x5d04109b0ce8 elem 0x5d041024f560 len 0 idx 0
virtqueue_flush vq 0x5d04109b0ce8 count 1
virtio_notify vdev 0x5d04109a8d50 vq 0x5d04109b0ce8
virtqueue_alloc_element elem 0x5d041024f560 size 56 in_num 1 out_num 0
virtqueue_pop vq 0x5d04109b0c50 elem 0x5d041024f560 in_num 1 out_num 0
virtqueue_fill vq 0x5d04109b0c50 elem 0x5d041024f560 len 110 idx 0
virtqueue_flush vq 0x5d04109b0c50 count 1
virtio_notify vdev 0x5d04109a8d50 vq 0x5d04109b0c50

The first 5 lines look like they were printed when an echo request was
sent to L0 and the next 5 lines were printed when an echo reply was
received.

After booting L2, I set up the tap device's IP address in L0 and the
vDPA port's IP address in L2.

When trying to ping L0 from L2, I only see the following lines being
printed:

virtqueue_alloc_element elem 0x5d041099ffd0 size 56 in_num 0 out_num 1
virtqueue_pop vq 0x5d0410d87168 elem 0x5d041099ffd0 in_num 0 out_num 1
virtqueue_fill vq 0x5d0410d87168 elem 0x5d041099ffd0 len 0 idx 0
virtqueue_flush vq 0x5d0410d87168 count 1
virtio_notify vdev 0x5d0410d79a10 vq 0x5d0410d87168

There's no reception. I used wireshark to inspect the packets that are
being sent and received through the tap device in L0.

When pinging L0 from L2, I see one of the following two outcomes:

Outcome 1:
----------
L2 broadcasts ARP packets and L0 replies to L2.

Source             Destination        Protocol    Length    Info
52:54:00:12:34:57  Broadcast          ARP         42        Who has 111.1.1.1? Tell 111.1.1.2
d2:6d:b9:61:e1:9a  52:54:00:12:34:57  ARP         42        111.1.1.1 is at d2:6d:b9:61:e1:9a

Outcome 2 (less frequent):
--------------------------
L2 sends an ICMP echo request packet to L0 and L0 sends a reply,
but the reply is not received by L2.

Source             Destination        Protocol    Length    Info
111.1.1.2          111.1.1.1          ICMP        98        Echo (ping) request  id=0x0006, seq=1/256, ttl=64
111.1.1.1          111.1.1.2          ICMP        98        Echo (ping) reply    id=0x0006, seq=1/256, ttl=64

When pinging L2 from L0 I get the following output in
wireshark:

Source             Destination        Protocol    Length    Info
111.1.1.1          111.1.1.2          ICMP        100       Echo (ping) request  id=0x002c, seq=2/512, ttl=64 (no response found!)

I do see a lot of traced lines being printed (by the QEMU instance that
was started in L0) with in_num > 1, for example:

virtqueue_alloc_element elem 0x5d040fdbad30 size 56 in_num 1 out_num 0
virtqueue_pop vq 0x5d04109b0c50 elem 0x5d040fdbad30 in_num 1 out_num 0
virtqueue_fill vq 0x5d04109b0c50 elem 0x5d040fdbad30 len 76 idx 0
virtqueue_flush vq 0x5d04109b0c50 count 1
virtio_notify vdev 0x5d04109a8d50 vq 0x5d04109b0c50

It looks like L1 is receiving data from L0 but this is not related to
the pings that are sent from L2. I haven't figured out what data is
actually being transferred in this case. It's not necessary for all of
the data that L1 receives from L0 to be passed to L2, is it?

I also noticed that there are now some lines with svq->vring.num = 256
where len > 0. These lines were printed by the QEMU instance running
in L1, so this corresponds to data that was received by L2.

svq->vring.num  used_elem.len  used_elem.id  svq->vq->queue_index
size: 256       len: 82        i: 0          vq idx: 0
size: 256       len: 82        i: 1          vq idx: 0
size: 256       len: 82        i: 2          vq idx: 0
size: 256       len: 54        i: 3          vq idx: 0

I still haven't figured out what data was received by L2 but I am
slightly confused as to why this data was received by L2 but not
the ICMP echo replies sent by L0.

Thanks,
Sahil
