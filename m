At most wipe the data if advertising that it won't be retained.
No need to actually do anything.

I'd go with a a per device per type set of counters.
Lets just say we have X of them on a device - once used up they are gone.
No need to worry too much on what X is.  Just pick some values so we have
something to test against. 4 maybe enough for testing?


Some comments on previous patch feed through to here.  A few more things inline.

LOG_UNIMP is a bit odd given there is nothing to do really.

As previously - I think this is invalid parameter as the command is supported
just not the sub_class.
