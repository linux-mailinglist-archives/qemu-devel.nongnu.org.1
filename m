No, I don't think so. You have the same thing already with
PL011State/PL011Luminary.

There, you have

* object_class_init
* device_class_init
* sysbus_device_class_init
* <PL011State as ClassInitImpl<PL011Class>>::class_init
  * <PL011State as ClassInitImpl<SysBusDeviceClass>>::class_init
    * <PL011State as ClassInitImpl<DeviceClass>>::class_init
      * <PL011State as ClassInitImpl<ObjectClass>>::class_init
* <PL011Luminary as ClassInitImpl<PL011Class>>::class_init
  * <PL011Luminary as ClassInitImpl<SysBusDeviceClass>>::class_init
    * <PL011Luminary as ClassInitImpl<DeviceClass>>::class_init
      * <PL011Luminary as ClassInitImpl<ObjectClass>>::class_init

But note that these calls are all different and indeed the last three are
empty (all vtable entries are None). This is like a C class_init
implementation that does not set any of sdc, dc or oc.

Moving on to another topic, about the gap (or question :-)) where a

Ugh, you're right. Maybe ClassInitImpl should just be merged into
ObjectImpl etc. as a default method implementation. I will check.

No, Self is not PL011Class. Self is PL011State (or PL011Luminary/ and it
always remains the same. What changes is *what part* of the class is
overwritten, but the order of calls from qom/object.c follows the same
logic in both C and Rust.

Do you still think that this is the case? I will look into how to avoid the
problem with the orphan rule, but otherwise I think things are fine.
