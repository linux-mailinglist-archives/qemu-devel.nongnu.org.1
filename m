* Is there some specific benefit to calling
'multifd_ram_flush_and_sync()' from OR before postcopy_start()? Maybe
that is missing on me.

* I'll try to explain why adding a migration command makes sense:

   - I did call 'multifd_ram_flush_and_sync()' before calling
postcopy_start() in migration_iteration_run(). After flushing the
'multifd_send' queue, all it does is send
'RAM_SAVE_FLAG_MULTIFD_FLUSH' flag on the main channel. On the
destination side the 'qemu_loadvm_state_main()' function does not
understand that message, because it looks for 'section_type'; And when
it is not able to identify the section, it leads to an error.

          "Expected vmdescription section, but got %d", section_type(=0)"

   - ie. multifd_ram_flush_and_sync() is not reusable by itself. To
make it work, we need to add a (RAM) section header to the message.
Because then it'll go to ram_load_precopy() and call ->
multifd_recv_sync_main().

   - But sending a lone RAM section header from
migration_iteration_run() OR even in postcopy_start() does not seem
right. That is out-of-place, because both migration_iteration_run()
and postcopy_start() have nothing to do with RAM sections.

   - I think  'flush' and 'sync' ought to be small individual
functions/operations that are section agnostic. We should be able to
call 'flush' and 'sync' from anywhere in the code without
side-effects. So tying 'flush' and 'sync' with RAM sections does not
seem right, because we need to be able to call 'flush' and 'sync' from
other parts too, like before calling postcopy_start() OR maybe some
other code parts.

   - Another observation is: when multifd and postcopy are enabled
together and the guest VM is writing to its RAM,
multifd_ram_flush_and_sync() is called only during setup, not after
that.

   - If we untie the 'flush and sync' from RAM sections and make it a
general migration command, we shall be able to call it from anywhere
else.

* But earlier we discussed 'flush and sync' is enough for that, no?
Because 'multifd_ram_flush_and_sync' only notifies the destination to
sync multifd_recv threads. It does not receive any acknowledgement
back.

* And multifd_recv_sync_main() function on the destination blocks the
'main' thread until all multfd_recv_threads (mig/dst/recv_x) have
exited, only then it proceeds to accept the incoming new postcopy
connection.


Thank you.
