Hmm I think this is not the truth..

Precopy keeps sending data even during postcopy, that's the background
stream (with/without preempt feature enabled).  May need some amendment
when repost here.

Please see my other reply, I think here it should never be POSTCOPY
channel, because postcopy (aka, preempt) channel is only created after the
main channel..

So I wonder whether this "if" will hit at all.

I think this is incorrect.. We should also need to check main channel is
established before start incoming.  The old code uses
migration_has_all_channels() which checks that.

IMHO it's clearer written as:

       if (migrate_multifd()) {
           if (!multifd_recv_all_channels_created()) {
               return false;
           }
       }

       if (migrate_preempt()) {
           if (mis->postcopy_qemufile_dst == NULL) {
               return false;
           }
       }

       return true;

>

I don't yet see how you manage the multifd threads, etc, on both sides.  Or
any logic to make sure multifd will properly flush the pages before
postcopy starts.  IOW, any guarantee that all the pages will only be
installed using UFFDIO_COPY as long as vcpu starts on dest.  Any comments?

The most complicated part of this work would be testing, to make sure it
works in all previous cases, and that's majorly why we disabled it before:
it was because it randomly crashes, but not always; fundamentally it's
because when multifd was designed there wasn't enough consideration on
working together with postcopy.  We didn't clearly know what's missing at
that time.

So we would definitely need to add test cases, just like whoever adds new
features to migration, to make sure at least it works for existing multifd
/ postcopy test cases, but when both features enabled.

Some hints on what we can add (assuming we already enable both features):

  - All possible multifd test cases can run one more time with postcopy
    enabled, but when precopy will converge and finish / cancel migration.

    e.g.:

    /x86_64/migration/multifd/file/mapped-ram/*

    These ones need to keep working like before, it should simply ignore
    postcopy being enabled.

    /x86_64/migration/multifd/tcp/uri/plain/none

    This one is the most generic multifd test, we'd want to make this run
    again with postcopy enabled, so it verifies it keeps working if it can
    converge before postcopy enabled.

    /x86_64/migration/multifd/tcp/plain/cancel

    This one tests multifd cancellations, and we want to make sure this
    works too when postcopy is enabled.

  - All possible postcopy test cases can also run one more time with
    multifd enabled.  Exmaples:

    /x86_64/migration/postcopy/plain

    The most generic postcopy test, we want to run this with multifd
    enabled, then this will cover the most simple use case of
    multifd-precopy plus postcopy.

    /x86_64/migration/postcopy/recovery/*

    These tests cover the fundamental postcopy recovery (plan, fails in
    handshake, fails in reconnect, or when using TLS), we may want to make
    sure these work even if multifd cap is enabled.

    /x86_64/migration/postcopy/preempt/*

    Similarly like above, but it now enables preempt channels too.

It will add quite a few tests to run here, but I don't see a good way
otherwise when we want to enable the two features, because it is indeed a
challenge to enable the two major features together here.

You can also do some manual tests with real workloads when working on this
series, that'll be definitely very helpful.  I had a feeling that this
series could already fail some when enable both features, but please give
it a shot.

Thanks,
