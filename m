Ah yes, I assume you meant when multiple devices can report different thing
even if with the same frontend / device type.  QOM should work, or anything
that can identify a device, e.g. with id / instance_id attached along with
the device class.

One thing that I still don't know how it works is how it interacts with new
hosts being added.

This idea is based on the fact that the cluster is known before starting
any VM.  However in reality I think it can happen when VMs started with a
small cluster but then cluster extended, when the -merge-platform has been
done on the smaller set.

Personally I don't worry too much on other offload bits besides USO* so far
if we have them ON for longer time.  My wish was that they're old good
kernel features mostly supported everywhere who runs QEMU, then we're good.

And I definitely worry about future offload features, or any feature that
may probe host like this and auto-OFF: I hope we can do them on the safe
side starting from day1.

So I don't know whether we should do that to USO* only or all.  But I agree
with you that'll definitely be cleaner.

On the details of how to turn them off properly..  Taking an example if we
want to turn off all the offload features by default (or simply we replace
that with USO-only)..

Upstream machine type is flexible to all kinds of kernels, so we may not
want to regress anyone using an existing machine type even on perf,
especially if we want to turn off all.

In that case we may need one more knob (I'm assuming this is virtio-net
specific issue, but maybe not; using it as an example) to make sure the old
machine types perfs as well, with:

  - x-virtio-net-offload-enforce

    When set, the offload features with value ON are enforced, so when
    the host doesn't support a offload feature it will fail to boot,
    showing the error that specific offload feature is not supported by the
    virtio backend.

    When clear, the offload features with value ON are not enforced, so
    these features can be automatically turned OFF when it's detected the
    backend doesn't support them.  This may bring best perf but has the
    risk of breaking migration.

With that,

  - On old machine types (compat properties):

    - set "x-virtio-net-offload-enforce" OFF
    - set all offload features ON

  - On new machine types (the default values):

    - set "x-virtio-net-offload-enforce" ON
    - set all offload features OFF

And yes, we can do that until 9.2, but with above even 9.1 should be safe
to do.  9.2 might be still easier just to think everything through again,
after all at least USO was introduced in 8.2 so not a regress in 9.1.

If it'll become a device property, there's still the trick / concern where
no-cross-migrate could conflict with the other offload feature that was
selected explicilty by an user (e.g. no-cross-migrate=ON + uso=OFF).
