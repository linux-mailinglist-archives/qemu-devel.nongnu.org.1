Right, that's also my understanding that it's by design for futex from
kernel POV.

Which I am not yet sure is whether it's by design to be used in userapp so
that a spurious wakeup could happen.  From which regard, I still think
maybe we shouldn't have that paragraph in the man page at all, at least it
can be clearer when put into man pages.

So now the question is, do we have such use case so that QEMU needs to free
a qemu_futex_*() API based lock _before_ any wakeups?

QEMU only has two locks impled on top of direct futex, which is QemuEvent
and QemuLockCnt.  From what I can tell on how they're used (not a lot),
none of them will use such as a feature, so IIUC it means QEMU still should
be free from such UAF issue, and it's definitely not a feature either.
Hence if any spurious wakeup happened in QEMU, it's a real bug.

From that POV, IMHO it would make more sense if we allow spurious wakeup
iff it's proved to be necessary (e.g. when QEMU wants to make it a feature
not a bug), and also I worry we're copying the man page content all over
into QEMU tree but just in case it's inaccurate to be applied to QEMU's
context at all.

Thanks,
