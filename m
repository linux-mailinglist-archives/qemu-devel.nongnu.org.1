We don't have to be able to express every deprecation in the schema. If
it can be expressed, that's nice, but docs/about/deprecated.rst is the
important part.

I don't think renaming options is necessary.

That would only make sense if we converted the block layer to a QOM
class hierarchy, which would be a project of its own.

The latter is what I would suggest. docs/about/deprecated.rst and
printing warnings. I think libvirt already keeps all IDs distinct
anyway, so for a large part of users nothing will change.
