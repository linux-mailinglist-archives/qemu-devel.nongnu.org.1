Yes, because the partition table is part of the MBR.  I'd rather name
the option after the entire thing it controls, not one of its parts.

Kevin is the maintainer, I just serve as advisor here.

I'm not a fan of conditional defaults, but I think it's better than a
nonsensical default that gets ignored.
