For a warmup, let's look at every unique instance of non-empty
paragraph text on an object that is used as a base anywhere:

Warning: AudiodevPerDirectionOptions - inlined paragraph
Warning: BlockdevOptionsCurlBase - inlined paragraph
Warning: BlockdevOptionsGenericCOWFormat - inlined paragraph
Warning: BlockdevOptionsGenericFormat - inlined paragraph
Warning: BlockExportOptionsNbdBase - inlined paragraph
Warning: BlockNodeInfo - inlined paragraph
Warning: ChardevCommon - inlined paragraph
Warning: CpuInstanceProperties - inlined paragraph
Warning: CryptodevBackendProperties - inlined paragraph
Warning: EventLoopBaseProperties - inlined paragraph
Warning: MemoryBackendProperties - inlined paragraph
Warning: NetfilterProperties - inlined paragraph
Warning: QCryptoBlockAmendOptionsLUKS - inlined paragraph
Warning: QCryptoBlockCreateOptionsLUKS - inlined paragraph
Warning: QCryptoBlockInfoBase - inlined paragraph
Warning: QCryptoBlockOptionsBase - inlined paragraph
Warning: QCryptoBlockOptionsLUKS - inlined paragraph
Warning: RngProperties - inlined paragraph
Warning: SecretCommonProperties - inlined paragraph
Warning: SpiceBasicInfo - inlined paragraph
Warning: TlsCredsProperties - inlined paragraph
Warning: VncBasicInfo - inlined paragraph

There's 22 instances.

Let's look at what they say:

AudiodevPerDirectionOptions: "General audio backend options that are
used for both playback and recording."
BlockdevOptionsCurlBase: "Driver specific block device options shared
by all protocols supported by the curl backend."
BlockdevOptionsGenericCOWFormat: "Driver specific block device options
for image format that have no option besides their data source and an
optional backing file."
BlockdevOptionsGenericFormat: "Driver specific block device options
for image format that have no option besides their data source."
BlockExportOptionsNbdBase: "An NBD block export (common options shared
between nbd-server-add and the NBD branch of block-export-add)."
BlockNodeInfo: "Information about a QEMU image file"
ChardevCommon: "Configuration shared across all chardev backends"

CpuInstanceProperties:
"List of properties to be used for hotplugging a CPU instance, it
should be passed by management with device_add command when a CPU is
being hotplugged.

Which members are optional and which mandatory depends on the
architecture and board.

For s390x see :ref:`cpu-topology-s390x`.

The ids other than the node-id specify the position of the CPU
within the CPU topology (as defined by the machine property "smp",
thus see also type @SMPConfiguration)"

CryptodevBackendProperties: "Properties for cryptodev-backend and
cryptodev-backend-builtin objects."
EventLoopBaseProperties: "Common properties for event loops"
MemoryBackendProperties: "Properties for objects of classes derived
from memory-backend."
NetfilterProperties: "Properties for objects of classes derived from netfil=
ter."
QCryptoBlockAmendOptionsLUKS: "This struct defines the update
parameters that activate/de-activate set of keyslots"
QCryptoBlockCreateOptionsLUKS: "The options that apply to LUKS
encryption format initialization"
QCryptoBlockInfoBase: "The common information that applies to all full
disk encryption formats"
QCryptoBlockOptionsBase: "The common options that apply to all full
disk encryption formats"
QCryptoBlockOptionsLUKS: "The options that apply to LUKS encryption format"
RngProperties: "Properties for objects of classes derived from rng."
SecretCommonProperties: "Properties for objects of classes derived
from secret-common."
SpiceBasicInfo: "The basic information for SPICE network connection"
TlsCredsProperties: "Properties for objects of classes derived from tls-cre=
ds."
VncBasicInfo: "The basic information for vnc network connection"

... Alright. So like 98% of the time, it's functionally useless
information for the end-user. The only thing that looks mildly
interesting is CpuInstanceProperties and *maybe*
QCryptoBlockAmendOptionsLUKS.

I propose we add a new section to QAPI doc blocks that gets ignored
from rendered documentation, like "Comment:" -- to keep any info that
might be mildly relevant to a developer that explains the *factoring*
of the object, but won't be exposed in user-facing documents.

On the occasion we DO want to inline documentation paragraphs, we can
leave them in and have the doc generator inline them. There's probably
very few cases where we actually want this.

Let's take a look at any tagged sections now, excluding "Since":

Warning: BackupCommon - inlined tag section Note
Warning: CpuInstanceProperties - inlined, tag section Note
Warning: MemoryBackendProperties - inlined tag section Note

Not very many! Just three.

BackupCommon:

Note: @on-source-error and @on-target-error only affect background
    I/O.  If an error occurs during a guest write request, the
    device's rerror/werror actions will be used.

BackupCommon is used as a base for DriveBackup and BlockdevBackup. In
this case, this note probably does belong on both. It should be
inlined and included.

CpuInstanceProperties:

Note: management should be prepared to pass through additional
    properties with device_add.

This is only used as a base with no other addon args for
NumaCpuOptions, in turn only used for an argument. This is probably
right to pass through, too. (Though I admit I don't really know what
it means... we can discuss the doc *quality* another day.)

MemoryBackendProperties:

Note: prealloc=3Dtrue and reserve=3Dfalse cannot be set at the same
    time.  With reserve=3Dtrue, the behavior depends on the operating
    system: for example, Linux will not reserve swap space for
    shared file mappings -- "not applicable". In contrast,
    reserve=3Dfalse will bail out if it cannot be configured
    accordingly.

This is used in MemoryBackendFileProperties,
MemoryBackendMemfdProperties, and MemoryBackendEpcProperties. None are
commands. I think the note here should also be inlined into each
object.

So, I think that:

- Most naked paragraphs are usually useless to the end-user, and we
should put them behind a Comment section to prevent them from being
inlined.
- Any *other* paragraph or section should be included in the
descendent. We'll just review with that eye going forward.
- Since: ... we'll talk about later this week.
