True!

There more than one way to skin this cat.  I like to keep state
normalized.

State is an optional StrOrNull.  Possible values:

* NULL

* QNull, i.e. non-NULL, ->type is QTYPE_QNULL

* Empty string, i.e. non-NULL, ->type is QTYPE_QSTRING, ->u.s is ""

* Non-empty string, i.e. non-NULL, -> type is QTYPE_QSTRING, ->u.s is
  not "" (and cannot be NULL)

As far as I understand, we have just two cases semantically:

* Set, value is a non-empty string (empty makes no sense)

* Unset

I'd normalize the state to "either NULL, or (non-empty) string".

When writing state, we need to normalize.

When reading state, we can rely on it being normalized.  Asserting it is
seems prudent, and should help readers.

Accidental external interface.

We pretty much ditched the x- convention in the QAPI schema.
docs/devel/qapi-code-gen.rst:

    Names beginning with ``x-`` used to signify "experimental".  This
    convention has been replaced by special feature "unstable".

Goes back to

commit a3c45b3e62962f99338716b1347cfb0d427cea44
Author: Markus Armbruster <armbru@redhat.com>
Date:   Thu Oct 28 12:25:12 2021 +0200

    qapi: New special feature flag "unstable"
    
    By convention, names starting with "x-" are experimental.  The parts
    of external interfaces so named may be withdrawn or changed
    incompatibly in future releases.
    
    The naming convention makes unstable interfaces easy to recognize.
    Promoting something from experimental to stable involves a name
    change.  Client code needs to be updated.  Occasionally bothersome.
    
    Worse, the convention is not universally observed:
    
    * QOM type "input-barrier" has properties "x-origin", "y-origin".
      Looks accidental, but it's ABI since 4.2.
    
    * QOM types "memory-backend-file", "memory-backend-memfd",
      "memory-backend-ram", and "memory-backend-epc" have a property
      "x-use-canonical-path-for-ramblock-id" that is documented to be
      stable despite its name.
    
    We could document these exceptions, but documentation helps only
    humans.  We want to recognize "unstable" in code, like "deprecated".
    
    So support recognizing it the same way: introduce new special feature
    flag "unstable".  It will be treated specially by the QAPI generator,
    like the existing feature flag "deprecated", and unlike regular
    feature flags.
    
    This commit updates documentation and prepares tests.  The next commit
    updates the QAPI schema.  The remaining patches update the QAPI
    generator and wire up -compat policy checking.
    
    Management applications can then use query-qmp-schema and -compat to
    manage or guard against use of unstable interfaces the same way as for
    deprecated interfaces.
    
    docs/devel/qapi-code-gen.txt no longer mandates the naming convention.
    Using it anyway might help writers of programs that aren't
    full-fledged management applications.  Not using it can save us
    bothersome renames.  We'll see how that shakes out.

The x- convention lives on in external interfaces that bypass QAPI, in
particular QOM/qdev properties.

Makes sense.
