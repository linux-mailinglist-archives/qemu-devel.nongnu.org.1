> + * This structure provides a vDSO-style clock to VM guests, exposing the
> + * relationship (or lack thereof) between the CPU clock (TSC, timebase, arch
> + * counter, etc.) and real time. It is designed to address the problem of
> + * live migration, which other clock enlightenments do not.
> + *
> + * When a guest is live migrated, this affects the clock in two ways.
> + *
> + * First, even between identical hosts the actual frequency of the underlying
> + * counter will change within the tolerances of its specification (typically
> + * ±50PPM, or 4 seconds a day). This frequency also varies over time on the
> + * same host, but can be tracked by NTP as it generally varies slowly. With
> + * live migration there is a step change in the frequency, with no warning.
> + *
> + * Second, there may be a step change in the value of the counter itself, as
> + * its accuracy is limited by the precision of the NTP synchronization on the
> + * source and destination hosts.
> + *
> + * So any calibration (NTP, PTP, etc.) which the guest has done on the source
> + * host before migration is invalid, and needs to be redone on the new host.
> + *
> + * In its most basic mode, this structure provides only an indication to the
> + * guest that live migration has occurred. This allows the guest to know that
> + * its clock is invalid and take remedial action. For applications that need
> + * reliable accurate timestamps (e.g. distributed databases), the structure
> + * can be mapped all the way to userspace. This allows the application to see
> + * directly for itself that the clock is disrupted and take appropriate
> + * action, even when using a vDSO-style method to get the time instead of a
> + * system call.
> + *
> + * In its more advanced mode. this structure can also be used to expose the
> + * precise relationship of the CPU counter to real time, as calibrated by the
> + * host. This means that userspace applications can have accurate time
> + * immediately after live migration, rather than having to pause operations
> + * and wait for NTP to recover. This mode does, of course, rely on the
> + * counter being reliable and consistent across CPUs.
> + *
> + * Note that this must be true UTC, never with smeared leap seconds. If a
> + * guest wishes to construct a smeared clock, it can do so. Presenting a
> + * smeared clock through this interface would be problematic because it
> + * actually messes with the apparent counter *period*. A linear smearing
> + * of 1 ms per second would effectively tweak the counter period by 1000PPM
> + * at the start/end of the smearing period, while a sinusoidal smear would
> + * basically be impossible to represent.
> + *
> + * This structure is offered with the intent that it be adopted into the
> + * nascent virtio-rtc standard, as a virtio-rtc that does not address the live
> + * migration problem seems a little less than fit for purpose. For that
> + * reason, certain fields use precisely the same numeric definitions as in
> + * the virtio-rtc proposal. The structure can also be exposed through an ACPI
> + * device with the CID "VMCLOCK", modelled on the "VMGENID" device except for
> + * the fact that it uses a real _CRS to convey the address of the structure

We don't want to manually sync headers with Linux.
I think Linux abi should live under uapi. When it is there, we can use
./scripts/update-linux-headers.sh machinery to import it.
