I checked the libvirt code and IIUC it waits for POSTCOPY_ACTIVE and
then it issues the 'cont' command, so it's concurrently with the device
state load. But as Peter mentioned, it doesn't actually start the VM if
the device load is not finished yet, it only sets the autostart variable
and the VM is started when the destination processes CMD_POSTCOPY_RUN
after the device state load.
