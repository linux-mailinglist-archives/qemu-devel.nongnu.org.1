Hmm.  When the destination reads as all zeroes, but is not (yet)
sparse, and the user has opened the destination image with
"discard":"unmap" and "detect-zeroes":"unmap", then pre-patch this
would sparsify the destination, but post-patch it leaves the
destination allocated.

When "detect-zeroes" is at its default of 'off', or even at 'on'
(which says optimize zero writes, but don't worry about punching
holes), that's not a problem.  But when "detect-zeroes" is at 'unamp',
this is a regression in behavior.  I'll see if I can quickly adjust
that in v3.
