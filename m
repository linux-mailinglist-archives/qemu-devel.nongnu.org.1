Dear Alex Benn=C3=A9e,

Thank you for your response and for the provided documentation link.

To clarify, when we refer to energy consumption, we are specifically lookin=
g at CPU core utilization. Our goal is to ensure that when we turn off CPU =
cores on the emulated Raspberry Pi 3B, the host machine does not keep its c=
orresponding cores running at 100% utilization.

This is particularly relevant for our use case, as our supervisor, M. Poque=
t, intends to use this project for teaching operating system development. S=
tudents using QEMU to emulate a Raspberry Pi 3B may have different host mac=
hines, so our objective is to implement a general approach that ensures CPU=
 core deactivation works properly regardless of the host system.

So far, our measurements indicate that even after turning off cores in the =
emulated system, all CPU cores on the host remain at 100% utilization. We a=
re exploring ways to improve this behavior.

We have looked into using -icount, but we would like to find a more viable =
solution, particularly for the Cortex-A53 CPU used in the Raspberry Pi 3B. =
Ideally, we would like to be able to use -smp 1 without being constrained b=
y QEMU=E2=80=99s limitations and to implement proper CPU core shutdown, sim=
ilar to what is available on x86-64 architectures.

Would you have any recommendations or insights on achieving better power ma=
nagement in this scenario?

Best regards,
Cl=C3=A9ment Aldebert & Laurent Polzin

Can you qualify that a bit more? What are you running the emulation on?
What power usage do you see?

Power consumption of the emulation is really just down to computational
efficiency of the emulation and if we ever get to a point that QEMU can
go idle giving the host system a chance to reach a lower power state.

If you want to run all emulation on a single core you could use -icount
to do that. It is less efficient though.

What documentation that exists can be found in the developers section of
the manual:
