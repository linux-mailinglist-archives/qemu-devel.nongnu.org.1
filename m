Thanks, you made me think about it once again)

Let me first describe the problem:

At initialization time, we want to know, are we going to get the
live backend from migration stream, or we should initialize it
by hand (e.g. calling open(), and other syscalls, and making other
preparations).

If we don't know, we have to postpone the initialization to some
later point, when we have an information.

The most simple thing is to postpone it to start of the vm.

But that's work bad: at this point we can't clearly rollback the migration.

So, we have to postpone to post-load in case of incoming migration, and
to start for normal start of QEMU (not incoming).

Still, there is still a significant disadvantage:

In case of non-fds migration, we move initilization of backing into downtime,
downtime becomes longer.

What to do?

We need a point in time, when downtime is not started, but we can check for
fds-passing global capability.

And this point in time is migration_incoming_state_setup(), actually.



Peter, could we add .incoming_setup() handler to VMStateDescription ?



So, final interface could look like:

1. global fds-passing migration capability, to enable/disable the whole feature

2. per-device fds-passing option, on by default for all supporting devices, to be
able to disable backing migration for some devices. (we discussed it here: https://lore.kernel.org/all/aL8kuXQ2JF1TV3M7@x1.local/ ).
Still, normally these options are always on by default.
And more over, I can postpone their implementation to separate series, to reduce discussion field, and to check that everything may work without additional user input.


And how it works (using the example of TAP)

1. Normal start of vm

- On device initialization we don't open /dev/net/tun, and don't intialize it
- On vm start (in device's set_status), we see that we are still don't have open fd, so open /dev/net/tun, and do all other actions around it

2. Usual migration without fds

on target:
- On device initialization we don't open /dev/net/tun, and don't intialize it
- In .incoming_setup(), we see that we are still don't have open fd, and we see that fds-capability is disabled, so open /dev/net/tun, and do all other actions around it, source is still running!
- Next, incoming migration starts, downtime starts.
- On vm start, we see that TAP is already initialized, nothing to do

3. Local migration with fds

- enable fds capability both on source and target
- In .incoming_setup(), we see that fds-capability is enabled, so nothing to do (we can check, that fd must not be set)
- During load of migration, we get fds
- In .post_load(), we do any remaining initialization actions around incoming fd (not too much, as backend device is already initialized)
- On vm start, we see that TAP is already initialized, nothing to do
