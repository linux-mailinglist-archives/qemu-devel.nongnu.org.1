Yes, IMHO it's because of the current design of VMSD isn't self describing,
then if some VMSD added new fields without boosting the version_id, what
can happen is when the destination reads that new VMSD field added it'll
assume it is the next thing to read, and that can be a completely different
VMSD for another device.  We just don't have anything to describe it.

E.g. for sending an uint32_t field, vmstate_info_uint32 only does
qemu_put_be32s(), we keep pushing data onto the wire without proper
description of that field.

We used to have some attempt describing these fields so it might be easier
at least for debugging, see:

commit 8118f0950fc77cce7873002a5021172dd6e040b5
Author: Alexander Graf <agraf@csgraf.de>
Date:   Thu Jan 22 15:01:39 2015 +0100

    migration: Append JSON description of migration stream

But that seems only for debugging.  E.g., that happens _after_ all vmstate
loaded.  So the reported error could be the same confusing, as when an
error happens it is before the JSON chunk ready.

We may be able to do better in this regard in the future, but that'll take
some thoughts and effort.

Right, there can be multiple ways to fail, and we may need to look into
them one by one.  They all take quite some effort.

Yes.  Allowing such compatibility means we declare support over all
binaries we released, including buggy ones.  But a bug is a bug, and it can
happen.  Just like QEMU, as one normal piece of software, can crash when
hit a bug, and it can happen to any binary because we can't guarantee it's
bug-free.

It's just too much to me.  It's also hard if not impossible, because I
don't think it always has a solution if the src QEMU is simply broken.
When such happens, we request the user to reboot with a correct version of
QEMU.
