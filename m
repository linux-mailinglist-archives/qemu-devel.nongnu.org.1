Hi Alano,

A very superficial review. Sadly I don't have time to dig
much deeper at the moment.

Good to see this support.

As below. Can probably replace the boilerplate with an SPDX license
line and just have the copyright + intro text here.

For new code in QEMU I think we are fine with just SPDX.  See many examples
in tree.  It saves on repeating this boilerplate.

Smells of value being written to a field rather than
a series of values with meaning on their own. Qemu
has a rich set of register field macros. I'd look
at using those to make your life easier.
