Hi Daniel,
Thanks for reviewing.

Great suggestion! I agree the implementation path you suggested would
look much nicer as a whole. Now that I looked a bit into the
"x86_load_linux" implementation, it looks like pretty much everything
is tied to expecting a filename. For example, after reading the header
from the kernel_filename x86_load_linux calls into load_multiboot,
load_elf (which in turn calls load_elf64, 32) and they all expect a
filename. I think I would need to refactor all of them to instead work
with (uint8_t *) buffers instead, right? Also in case of
initrd_filename the existing code maps the file using
g_mapped_file_new to the X86MachineState member initrd_mapped_file. So
that will need to be looked into and refactored. Please correct me if
I misunderstood something about the way to implement your suggested
approach.

If I am understanding this right, this probably requires a lot of work
which will also probably not be straightforward to implement or test.
Right now, the way the code is, it's easy to see that the existing
code paths are still correct as they are not changed and the new
nitro-enclave machine code just hooks into them. As the loading to
memory, writing to disk and loading back to memory only is in the
execution path of the new nitro-enclave machine type, I think the way
the patch is right now, is a good first implementation. What do you
think?

Thanks.

Regards,
Dorjoy
