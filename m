I am running the UEFI Self-Certification Tests (SCT) on EDK 2 using:

qemu-system-riscv64 \
       -M virt,acpi=off -accel tcg -m 4096 \
       -serial mon:stdio \
       -device virtio-gpu-pci \
       -device qemu-xhci \
       -device usb-kbd \
       -drive 
if=pflash,format=raw,unit=0,file=RISCV_VIRT_CODE.fd,readonly=on \
       -drive if=pflash,format=raw,unit=1,file=RISCV_VIRT_VARS.fd \
       -drive file=sct.img,format=raw,if=virtio \
       -device virtio-net-device,netdev=net0 \
       -netdev user,id=net0

This does not invoke any CXL related stuff.

Best regards

Heinrich
