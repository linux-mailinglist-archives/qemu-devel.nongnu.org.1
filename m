We have that in the TODO wiki page for a long time, I'll update it
slightly.

https://wiki.qemu.org/ToDo/LiveMigration#Rewrite_QEMUFile_for_migration

But yeah that might be too big a hammer to solve this specific issue.
AFAIU Fabiano is looking into that direction, but I assume it should still
be a long term thing.

Agree. However would this still be quite some change?

We still have a lot of references on the four qemufiles (to/from_dst_file,
to/from_src_file), at least that'll need a replacement; I didn't yet
further check whether all places can be done with a direct replacement of
such change, some tweaks may be needed here and there, but shouldn't be
major.

Meanwhile IIUC it'll also need a major rework on QEMUFile, allowing it to
be bi-directional?  We may need to duplicate the cache layer, IIUC, one for
each direction IOs.
