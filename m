memory_region_ref() is not the only place that is responsible for 
reference management. memory_region_do_init() also calls 
object_property_add_child(), which in turn calls object_ref() to create 
a reference from the owner to the memory region. We should keep using 
object_ref() for object references originating from the owner.

Calling memory_region_del_subregion() is not consistent with the 
direction of object references. A container references its subregion so 
the container should remove references to its subregion when 
appropriate. A subregion should not remove the reference its container 
holds.

mr->owner == NULL is an exceptional case that we allow for performance 
reasons. We have luxury to spend more time in our case.

We need to take care of the semantics of subregion. A container needs 
its subregions to satisfy accesses to the memory it represents. So it 
refers to the subregions, and the reference must keep the subregions 
alive; that's why we must keep the ordering.
