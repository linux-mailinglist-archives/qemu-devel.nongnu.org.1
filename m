Hard to tell without seeing the code, but it looks like you're trying to
wake up the coroutine while you're still executing in the context of the
same coroutine.

It looks like the documentation of qio_channel_tls_handshake() is wrong
and the function can return and call the callback immediately without
dropping out of coroutine context.

A rather heavy-handed, but obvious approach would be moving the
qio_channel_tls_handshake() into a BH, then you know you'll always be
outside of coroutine context in the callback.

But maybe it would be enough to just check if the coroutine isn't
already active:

    if (!qemu_coroutine_entered(co)) {
        aio_wake_co(co);
    }

If it's possible, I think that would be nicer in the code and would also
reduce the time the guest is blocked while we're creating a new NBD
connection.

*reads code*

Hm... Actually, one thing I was completely unaware of is that all of
this is running in a separate thread, so maybe the existing synchronous
code already doesn't block the guest. nbd_co_establish_connection()
starts this thread. The thread doesn't have an AioContext, so anything
that involves scheduling something in an AioContext (including BHs and
waking up coroutines) will result in code running in a different thread.

I'm not sure why a thread is used in the first place (does it do
something that coroutines can't do?) and if running parts of the code in
a different thread would be a problem, but we should probably have a
look at this first. Mixing threads and coroutines feels strange.
