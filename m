TCG already has the possibility to generate jumps inside a TB 
(conditional branches - brcond, is an example).

However, for the scope of this series, it does not matter.
We only have to check the from_pc when a discontinuity is detected (and 
not all the time), so there is no need to anticipate the "next" instruction.

As it's a test plugin, I think it would be a better default to abort on 
error, and not be able to deactivate it. Any difference we find would be 
a bug anyway, so require fixing.
