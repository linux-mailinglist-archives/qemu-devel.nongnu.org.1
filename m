Agreed, I think we are saying approximately the same thing here.

 We need a mechanism to retrieve the vCPUs endianness and a way to
notify subscribed devices when it changes.

 I think that then, since the virtio device is mostly certain of the
correct target endianness and completely certain of the host
endianness, it can perform the necessary conversions.

 I don't recall seeing a restriction on the byte ordering of PCM
formats other than the CPU order; except for the ones which have
explicit endianness in their definitions. Please correct me if I am
wrong!

A straightforward solution would be to set an endianness change notify
callback in DeviceClass. What do you think?
