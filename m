I was on the verge of adding Cc: qemu-stable for it, but then decided
against it because it does subtly change behaviour in the common case
where the connection doesn't go down. On second thoughts, the common use
case is 'qemu-img info' where the image isn't opened encrypted (because
we're only trying to find out which encryption format it has), and that
output stays the same. So taking it into stable might still be
reasonable enough.
