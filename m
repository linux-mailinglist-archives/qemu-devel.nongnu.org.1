They should work.

Probably.  You probably don't need to represent times as uint64_t (or time64_t), but as 
differentials for elapsed time.

We could accumulate into 'float' if you were concerned about overflowing 2^32 units.  This 
is statistics after all; we don't really need exact numbers, we need magnitude and 2-3 
digits of precision.
