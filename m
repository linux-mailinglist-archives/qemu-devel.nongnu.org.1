That adds nothing more than you have already told in the past discussion 
in this thread.

I started this thread because I found that the current implementation 
only exercises udmabuf and VFIO devices that is known to implement 
mmap(). On the other hand, the cited email discusses VFIO devices that 
are not known to implement mmap() or future DMA-BUF exporters in 
general. It says:
 > Just wanted to confirm that it's entirely legit to not implement
 > dma-buf mmap. Same for the in-kernel vmap functions. Especially for

This doesn't apply to udmabuf and VFIO devices we are concerned with. 
udmabuf is obviously not "funny buffers", and can be vmapped. Besides, 
the udmabuf already implements mmap() and *removing* it can break 
userspace unlike a DMA-BUF exporter that never implemented mmap(), which 
was discussed in the cited email.

Speaking of VFIO devices, the code already checks it's mmapped by 
calling memory_region_is_ram_device() and yet this patch tries to allow 
blobs that cannot be mmapped, which is inconsistent.

So, the discussion should be summarized as the following two questions:
1. Can the kernel remove an existing mmap() implementation that is known 
to be depended by the userspace (udmabuf)?
2. Can the kernel let an mmap() implementation fail though it once 
worked (VFIO)?

The cited email doesn't answer either of them.

Akihiko Odaki
