I agree. At the same time, rushing a policy change is bad but making an
uninformed one is too. Submitting the non-AI change, recounting the
experience with the AI tool, and explaining how they differed for me,
hopefully helps informing decisions. In fact this is probably at the upper
end of the complexity, for what can still be described as mechanical
transformation.

In other words, I want to be clear that, even though I did rush a bit the
discussion on the policy, I don't want to rush the changes but rather be
prepared for them.

Indeed. And also, the nuances are more important for something where type
hints describe an API than if you're doing it only for some extra static
checking.

You can always start with a tool and refine, too. In fact I expect that
*if* an exception is granted for mechanical changes, submissions would
almost never consist of AI-generated changes only. Full isolation may not
always be practical, but separating AI- or tool-generated commits from
human refinements is something we'd ask for anyway, for the sake of
reviewability.
