Maybe and the graph for CPU topology.

CPU topology is not just an abstraction of the purely virtual topology
hierarchy, but also has a direct impact on how we should organize
heterogeneous cores and caches in a machine.

Since the heterogeneous machine I'm dealing with directly is the Intel
client CPUs (Alder Lake, Rapor Lake and Meteor Lake), with the same
target but very different performance/power efficiency cores. And though
the P core and E core for Intel hybrid CPU have the nearly identical
ISAs, they still have some difficience, e.g., their PMUs have different
events.

Therefore, I think this case should also be included in the
heterogeneous machine category, right?

About the CPU topology graph, I also posted some RFCs:
* The first try: [RFC 00/52] Introduce hybrid CPU topology
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20230213095035.158240-1-zhao1.liu@linux.intel.com/

* The second try: [RFC 00/41] qom-topo: Abstract Everything about CPU
  Topology:
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20231130144203.2307629-1-zhao1.liu@linux.intel.com/

Unfortunately, however, no feedback was received on the second attempt.
I'd hope to be educated in the right direction as well. So hopefully
when discussing heterogeneous machines, the Intel hybrid CPU case
especially hybrid topology scenarios can also be taken into
consideration, which is the heterogeneous scenario we are trying to push
in virtualization.
