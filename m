I'm definitely in favor of this support for testing purposes as well as
for the GPU cases you describe.

Given I took your brief comment on hotplug and expanded on it +CC David
and Oscar.

This is only sort of true and perhaps reflects support in the kernel for ACPI
features being missing as no one has yet been interested in them.
See 9.11.3 Hot-pluggable Memory Description Illustrated in the 6.6 ACPI spec.
That has an example where the EFI_MEMORY_SP bit is provided. 
I had a dig around and for now ACPICA / kernel doesn't seem to put that alongside
write_protect and the other bits that IIUC come from the same field.
It would be relatively easy to pipe that through and potentially add handling
in the memory hotplug path to allow for drivers to pick these regions up
(which boils down I think to making them visible in some way but doing nothing
else with them)

Other path would be to use a discoverable path such as emulating CXL memory.
Hotplug of that would work fine from point of view of coming up as driver managed
SPM style (the flag is in runtime data provided by the device). It would however
look different to the firmware managed approach you are using in the host.

All I want to draw attention to is that there are other ways of doing this
that might be relevant in future, but don't work for what you need to do today.
So don't see this an objection to this specific bit of work!

Thanks,

Jonathan
