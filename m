This series contains a number of tidy-ups and improvements to the NeXTCube machine
which include:

  - Bringing the code up-to-date with our latest coding standards/APIs, in particular
    related to the board configuration and IRQ wiring

  - Remove the remaining overlapping memory regions and consolidating multiple
    register implementations into a single place

  - Add a new next-scsi device containing the ESP device and its associated
    CSRs

  - Adding the empty_slot device to fill unimplemented devices and removing
    the "catch-all" next.scr memory region

  - QOMifying the next-rtc device and wiring it up with gpios as required

The next-cube machine looks in fairly good shape now, the main remaining work is to
create a separate device for the DMA controller and update the wiring of the IRQs
(including to the CPU) accordingly.

There is no change to the behaviour of the next-cube machine with this series in
that the next-cube machine with a suitable ROM image can now load the kernel from
a pre-installed NeXTStep image and start executing it.

Note that due to the device model changes this is a migration break, however since
the next-cube machine is currently unable to boot anything useful, I don't see
this as an issue.

[Patches still needing review: 21, 25, 28, 29, 30]

v3:
- Rebase onto master
- Fix addresses in comments for patch 2 as noted by Thomas
- Add R-B tags from Thomas and Phil
- Use s->rtc directly in patch 25 rather than object_resolve_path_component()
- Use s->escc directly in patch 11 rather than object_resolve_path_component()
- Add numeric suffixes for empty slot names in patch 14
- Drop patch 34 due to legal uncertainty of replace boilerplate licence text
  with SPDX equivalent as indicated by Daniel

v2:
- Rebase onto master
- Drop patches 1 and 4 (these have been merged separately as bugfixes)
- Add R-B tags from Thomas and Phil
- Update commit message in patch 2
- Add comments containing system register addresses as requested by Thomas in
  patch 2
- Update description for patch 7 explaining that the SCSI CSRs are also now
  modelled as standard registers (similar to Previous)
- Update description for patch 8 explaining why the previously hardcoded value
  has been dropped
- Add comments suggesting unimplemented devices in patch 14
- Remove next_rtc_vmstate from next_pc_vmstate in patch 25
- Fix cut/paste error in patch 30 headline
