I can try to move the todo even higher.  Trying to list the initial goals
here:

- One extra phase of handshake between src/dst (maybe the time to boost
  QEMU_VM_FILE_VERSION) before anything else happens.

- Dest shouldn't need to apply any cap/param, it should get all from src.
  Dest still need to be setup with an URI and that should be all it needs.

- Src shouldn't need to worry on the binary version of dst anymore as long
  as dest qemu supports handshake, because src can fetch it from dest.

- Handshake can always fail gracefully if anything wrong happened, it
  normally should mean dest qemu is not compatible with src's setup (either
  machine, device, or migration configs) for whatever reason.  Src should
  be able to get a solid error from dest if so.

- Handshake protocol should always be self-bootstrap-able, it means when we
  change the handshake protocol it should always works with old binaries.

  - When src is newer it should be able to know what's missing on dest and
    skip the new bits.

  - When dst is newer it should all rely on src (which is older) and it
    should always understand src's language.

- All !main channels need to be established later than the handshake - if
  we're going to do this anyway we probably should do it altogether to make
  channels named, so each channel used in migration needs to have a common
  header.  Prepare to deprecate the old tricks of channel orderings.

Does it look reasonable?  Anything to add/remove?

Thanks,
