Yes, looks like ignoring it otherwise is harmless.

Yes, that was what I thought.

I agree that this is probably the best change to make.

If you also want to add that comment that there already is a D2H FIS
sent during reset, and maybe change the commit message to explain why
we're touching ahci_reset_port(), I think I would prefer if you sent a
v3. I'm usually happy to make small changes while applying, but it feels
like this would be a larger change than I would be comfortable making
without having it on the mailing list again.
