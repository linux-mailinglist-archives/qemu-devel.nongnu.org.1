Let me append some more info here..

I think madvise() isn't needed as fallocate() should do the population work
already, afaiu, then it means we pass the shmem path to QEMU and QEMU
should notice this memory-backend-file existed, open() directly.

I quicked walk the QEMU memory code and so far it looks all applicable, so
that QEMU should just start the guest with the pre-populated shmem page
caches.

There's one trick where qemu_ram_mmap() will map some extra pages, on x86
4k, and I don't yet know why we did that..

    /*
     * Note: this always allocates at least one extra page of virtual address
     * space, even if size is already aligned.
     */
    total = size + align;

But that was only used in mmap_reserve() not mmap_activate(), so the real
mmap() should still be exactly what we fallocate()ed.

Thanks,
