So the use case is exposing a configurable cache topology to the guest
in order to increase performance.  Performance can increase when the
configured virtual topology is closer to the physical topology than a
default topology would be.  This can be the case with CPU host or max.

Correct?

I think I understand why you want to configure caches.  My question was
about the connection to SMP.

Say we run a guest with a single core, no SMP.  Could configuring caches
still be useful then?

Needs documenting.

If you make it an error, you don't have to document it :)

I'm afraid I don't understand what is supposed to happen when I tell
QEMU to make a cache's topology invalid.

SmpCacheLevelAndType is quite a mouthful.

I had typoed "of call caches", which makes no sense, so I corrected it.
