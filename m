Thanks again for the insightful questions and for sparking this valuable 
discussion.


 From my observation of real-world, commercially available SoCs, the 
SMMU is almost exclusively designed for and used with PCIe. Of course, 
you're right that architecturally, the SMMU specification certainly 
allows for non-PCIe clients. Peter's point about using the SMMU for the 
GIC ITS in a Realm context is an excellent example. I've also personally 
seen similar setups in the TF-A-Tests+FVP software stack, where platform 
device, named SMMUv3TestEngine, was used to test the SMMU.

However, from the perspective of QEMU's current implementation, there 
are some significant limitations that guided the design of smmu-testdev. 
At the moment, the SMMU model does not really support non-PCIe devices. 
Two key issues are:

- The IOMMU MemoryRegion, used with PCIe device, cannot be used with a 
platform device, which is the primary mechanism for routing DMA traffic 
through the IOMMU.

- Internally, the SMMU code makes assumptions about its clients. For 
instance, the smmu_get_sid() function explicitly expects a PCIe device 
and has no path to acquire a StreamID for a platform device.

Given this, the decision to model smmu-testdev as a minimal, PCI-like 
device is a pragmatic one. It aligns with the most common real-world use 
case while also working within the constraints of QEMU's current SMMU 
implementation.

This is a great point that I haven't fully considered. To make sure I 
understand correctly, are you referring to IOMMU implementations for 
other architectures, such as VT-d on x86 or the ongoing IOMMU work for 
RISC-V? I'll admit this is an area I haven't looked into. I'm very open 
to ideasâdo you or others have suggestions on how this test-device 
pattern could be generalized or what would be needed to make it useful 
across different architectures?

Thanks again for the great feedback.

Best regards,

Tao
