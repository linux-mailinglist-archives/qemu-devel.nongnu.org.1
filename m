The NBD server already supports clients that make requests through
multiple TCP sockets, but right now, that server is not taking
advantage of iothreads to spread the TCP load.

And yes, I am in the middle of working on adding client NBD multi-conn
support (reviving Rich Jones' preliminary patches on what it would
take to have qemu open parallel TCP sockets to a supporting NBD
server), which also will use a round-robin approach (but here, the
round-robin is something we would code up in qemu, rather than the
behavior handed to us by the FUSE kernel layer).  Pinning specific
iothreads to a specific TCP socket may or may not make sense, but I
definitely want to have support for handing a pool of iothreads to an
NBD client that will be using multi-conn.
