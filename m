Also good to me.

I think this creates logical inconsistency. You builds the private MMIO
EPT mapping on fault based on the HVA<->HPA mapping, but doesn't follow
the HVA<->HPA mapping change. Why KVM believes the mapping on fault time
but doesn't on mmu notify time?

The first commit of guest_memfd emphasize a lot on the benifit of
decoupling KVM mapping from host mapping. My understanding is even if
guest memfd can be faultable later, KVM should still work in a way
without userspace mapping.

It truly is. I'm expecting some suggestions here.
