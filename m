Hi Richard, I'm very glad to hear from you, I really am! :)

Nope, there was no single surprise so far, it is more, it all
works now quite well, all long-standing issues which we had
are now gone.

We have new discoveries, but that's just that - new discoveries,
like stuff which was broken the same way in 6.0 as in current
master.  Or new tests which no one run before, discovering new
issues in new code.  But overall, this part works fairy well.

Yeah, I guess everyone noticed your absence :)
You did great job at fixing this stuff, it waited for the
good refresh for quite some time.

Thank you!
