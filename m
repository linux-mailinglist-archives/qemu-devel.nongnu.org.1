If we wanted to merge the two subsystems I think we'd need that;
and also a "kind of log" tagging.

True, but both those categories are for log messages that
are "in normal operation never happens". So it's not like
the message you're interested in is buried under a ton of
irrelevant logging.

The '-d' backend also lets you list them all with
  qemu-system-arm -d trace:help

But it's one of the key things -d does: "-d in_asm" for listing
the input guest instructions is a super common use case, for instance.
If we want to merge qemu_log with tracepoint logs then we need
to have some answer to this.

(Of course, we could leave the two logging/tracing subsystems
the way they are now: there's not really a super strong
motivation for refactoring everything to be able to drop the
qemu_log stuff.)
