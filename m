The "Learn the architecture" documentation might be a good introduction
https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0127/0200/Overview
In particular the part about Realm creation:
https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0127/0200/Realm-management/Realm-creation-and-attestation

The RMM specification describes exactly how the RIM is calculated, but
is less palatable:
https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0137/1-0rel0/?lang=en
A7.1.1 Realm Initial Measurement

More specialized resource are the attestation token documentation:
[1] https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ffm-rats-cca-token-00
and CCA Security Model:
https://developer.arm.com/documentation/DEN0096/latest/

It comes from a well known manufacturer key, although the signing can be
delegated in some models (like in the current demos):

The hardware RoT creates a key pair for the RMM, which the RMM uses to
sign the RIM. The RoT then signs the RMM pubkey, using the well-known key
(see [1] 4.10 Token Binding).

In this case it does matter because we don't trust the host VMM which
instructs RMM where to load the images. So we need to verify that the
image is in the correct location, otherwise the VM could be executing the
wrong part of the code, or using the wrong part of the data loaded into
RAM.

When loading an image the RMM hashes its content, then hashes a structure
that contains both the content hash and the address, and it is that hash
that is added to the RIM.

Thanks,
Jean
