Nice work - this is very clean and well presented.

I would like Fan to take a look an provide some tags as DCD modeling in
QEMU is more in his area of expertise than mine!

I think this series is much more ready for upstream than much of
my staging cxl tree so I'll rebase it to go near the front.

Today I'm focused on getting test cases to Richard for the TCG issues but
after that I'll spin a new tree (probably pushed out under a name
that makes it clear there is a known nasty problem though!)
