I don't know how we could guarantee that at all - anon and shmem uses
different knobs to enable/disable THPs after all.. For example:

  $ ls /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/*enabled
  /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
  /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/shmem_enabled

And their default values normally differ too... it means after switching to
fd based we do face the possibility that thp can be gone at least on the
1st 2mb.

When I was suggesting it, I was hoping thp doesn't really matter that lot
on aux mem, even for VGA.

Btw, I don't even think the alignment will affect THP allocations for the
whole vma, anyway?  I mean, it's only about the initial 2MB portion.. IOW,
when not aligned, I think the worst case is we have <2MB at start address
that is not using THP, but later on when it starts to align with 2MB, THPs
will be allocated again.

The challenge is more on the "fd-based" side, where shmem on most distros
will disable THP completely.

But my question is why this is special?  For example, we don't do that for
"-object memory-backend-memfd", am I right?

Ahh so it's only about the corner cases where CPR could raise an error?
Can we rely on the failure later on "migrate" command to tell which
ramblock doesn't support it, so the user could be aware as well?

Yep, I was thinking maybe qemu_ram_alloc_from_fd() had a stub function,
indeed looks not..  "allocating the fd" part definitely has, which I
remember I checked..

As long as you don't need to duplicate these two checks (or duplicate any
such check..) I'm ok.

Reusing qemu_ram_alloc_from_fd() still sounds like the easiest to go.  Yes
we'll need to teach it about resize(), used_length etc. to it, but they all
look sane to me.  We didn't have those simply because we don't have use of
them, now we want to have resizable fd-based mem, that's the right thing to
do to support that on fd allocations.

OTOH, duplicating xen/mmu checks isn't sane to me.. :( It will make the
code harder to maintain because the 3rd qemu_ram_alloc_from_fd() in the
future will need to duplicate it once more (or worse, forget it again until
xen / old kernels reports a failure)..
