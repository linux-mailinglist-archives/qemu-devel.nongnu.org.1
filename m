Hello Peter,

* It is not ignored. Simplifying flush conditionals makes sense to me
too, that is why in the 'v0' version of this series I had added the
!migration_in_postcopy() check to the migrate_multifd() function,
right? I tried to discuss in the 'v1' thread if there's another way to
simplify conditionals. Not sure if you've followed all comments in the
thread.

* Secondly, as you mention above, I also thought Fabiano is pointing
at the complexity of the 'if' conditionals and thus I replied that his
proposed patch does not seem to solve for that complexity. But in his
subsequent reply Fabiano mentions that it is not just about
conditionals, but larger complexity of how and when multifd threads do
flush and sync amongst them.

* IMHO, simplifying that larger complexity of how multifd threads do
flush and sync can be done independently, outside the scope of this
patch series, which is about enabling multifd and postcopy together.

* I'm yet to get to the test cases. The revised series(v1 and v2) are
posted to share patch updates which were suggested in the previous
reviews. Test cases are a separate/different effort from source
patches. If we want to hold on this patch series till we get the test
cases and documentation in place, that is okay, I'll work on that
next.

Thank you.
