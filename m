I've been working this on Device Assignment software stack recently 
published by Arm, to run that under QEMU.

[1] 
https://git.trustedfirmware.org/plugins/gitiles/TF-RMM/tf-rmm/+/refs/heads/topics/da_alp12_v2

As part of the implementation, I had to define SMMU Realm registers and 
some root registers as well.
I based the work on this series, and the banked approach works well to 
add Realm registers. For Root registers, since they have different 
offsets than NonSecure, Secure and Realm ones, they need their own 
{read,write}_mmio function.

Just that to say that it's a great start, and I'm looking forward to 
work with the v3.

Regards,
Pierrick
