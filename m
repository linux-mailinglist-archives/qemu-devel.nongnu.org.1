I agree - although I don't think there are too many more variations.
Most of the other arches use pc.

Hmm thats interesting. Looking at the gdb docs:

  code_ptr
  data_ptr

      Pointers to unspecified code and data. The program counter and any
      dedicated return address register may be marked as code pointers;
      printing a code pointer converts it into a symbolic address. The
      stack pointer and any dedicated address registers may be marked as
      data pointers.

I'm not sure we can necessarily infer PC like behaviour based on that.

I have been messing with a systrace plugin and I can track the values of
el1_elr and they seem sane:

But due to the way I track the changes I don't see changes that are
implicit due to branch instructions, only when the kernel directly
manipulates them.

We could extend the XML itself but that makes things tricky when we sync
with gdb.
