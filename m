It might still be good IMHO to have that assert(), not only to abort
earlier, but also as a code-styled comment.  Your call when resend.

PS: feel free to queue existing patches into your own tree without
resending the whole series!

I still want to double check with you: we leaked iov[] in most compressors
here, or did I overlook something?

That's definitely more important than the doc update itself..

OK, but it's confusing.  Some rewords you mentioned below could work.

Yep, it's OK.
