Ken,

   Lookup starting the gvncviewer tool after you start the virtual machine.  To get the display for the VMs I run gvncviewer and sometimes spicec.

I have a vmlinux and a bzImage that I want to serve as the kernel that QEMU runs with, and a single binary, let's just call it literally `program`, that I want to issue a command to run once QEMU boots with the kernel.

I need to be able to see standard output and to be able to type into the console to enter the command, and I don't know how to get it to or why it isn't showing that already. Also, once that is working, I need a way to put `program` into the QEMU session so that it can be run. Can someone help me? I think I need to make an img file that can boot but I don't really know how to do that either.
