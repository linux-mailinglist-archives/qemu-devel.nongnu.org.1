Whew, it's been such a long time since I've looked at this, I barely
remember. I think my email now knows more about the problem than *I*
currently do. I'm glad I wrote it ...

I do not currently know what happens if you fix the first issue but not the
other four; I don't know if it gets passably "less broken" or if it causes
other bigger issues... and I don't have the bandwidth to test that out
currently, my apologies.

If there's a renewed interest in fixing this, I can try to start ramping
back up on it, but I have a few other projects to finish first, but
possibly I could discuss this at KVM Forum to help delineate the work into
manageable chunks.
