Thanks for this snapshot_migration_state() example. Then I think the
original to_migration_state() is better (returning migration state in the
`Result` looks better than passing `&mut` :). )

Indeed, I had misunderstood this point. Rethink the pre_save: Use HPET
as the example - changing something within `pre_save` is what HPETState's
`pre_save` does, and it's unrelated to the current Migratable<>'s
`pre_save`.

Here, Migratable<>'s `pre_save` is used to assist in retrieving the
corresponding migration state.

EMM, I didn't your point here... could you please talk more about this
point?

Yes, I see.

Yes!

Okay, I agree.
