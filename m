As far as I can tell, our build system runs sphinx-build -b html and -b
man.

I run it with -b text manually all the time to hunt for and review
changes in output.  I'd prefer to keep it working if practical.

For what it's worth, there is a bit of LaTeX configuration in
docs/conf.py.

Suggest to add something like "compensate for the loss of QapiErrorClass
documentation in the QEMU QMP Reference Manual".

Can you explain why and how struct vs. union matters to you as a
developer?

I'd prefer a single index.

Suggest the render them the same as before.

Have a look at BackupCommon's "Note" box in the old docs: the member
names appear to use a fixed-width font.

Peeking at old qapidoc.py...  it seems to rewrite @foo to ``foo``.

No need to decide or extricate right now.  Tasklist is good enough for
me.

Commit b32a6b62a82 (qapi: nail down convention that Errors sections are
lists)

"Mandate" means changing "should be formatted as an rST list" into "must
be", plus enforcement.  Works for me.
