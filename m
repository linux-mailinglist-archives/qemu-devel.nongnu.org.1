To expand on this, by chance fw_cfg is visible to the guest OS, and thus
apps developers have (mis-)used this as a way to config data to the OS.
This should *not* be relied upon to work everywhere/anywhere. Adding it
to other targets / machines for general purpose application usage is a
non-goal for QEMU.

mkosi is a simple python tool for creating virtual disk images aka acronym
"MaKe Operating System Image".

What they need is a way to pass configuration metadata into the guest.

They already support a range of options, in order of preference looking
for SMBIOS (OEM strings),  fw_cfg, kernel command line:

  https://github.com/systemd/mkosi/blob/6c33859a1b445e0bff19d9e7f28158140893a3e4/mkosi/qemu.py#L1336

If none of those 3 options are viable, then a further option is to create
a virtual disk image containing a JSON file of the data needed and pass
that in. There are other options available too, virtiofs, 9p, usb-mtp,
virtio-serial, virtio-sock, all of which provide a ways to communicate
with the guest OS, with varying pros & cons. It is upto mkosi devs to
decide which best serve their needs, if they think their current 3 options
are insufficient.

With regards,
Daniel
