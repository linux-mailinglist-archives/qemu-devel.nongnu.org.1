More like "if it ain't broke don't fix it".

OK, can we then make libfdt and dtc mandatory and not build at all instead 
of disabling boards without it? I only care that my boards will be in 
distro packages so users don't have to compile and I don't have to provide 
binaries which would also be ensured if we require dtc, then the dtbs can 
be dropped.

There's still a potential issue that some of the dts files are old and may 
not compile with newer dtc and changing them may upset the guest but 
hopefully we won't get that.
