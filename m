No. I meant for CSPs who want to provide an EMR virtual machine to their 
customers, or lab admin provides an EMR (virtual) machine to its user.

Without a dedicated EmeraldRapids cpu model provided by QEMU, they need 
to use something like

   -cpu SapphireRapids,model=207,model-id="Intel Xeon Processor 
(EmeraldRapids)"

It's likely that no difference in supported features between SPR cpu 
model and EMR cpu model in the end. If so, will QEMU choose to provide a 
dedicated CPU model for EMR? or just document somewhere to QEMU users 
that "if you want to create an virtual machine with EMR cpu model, 
please go with SPR cpu model while changing it's model number to EMR's 
207 and changing model-id to tell EmeraldRapids" ?

No, it's not the purpose. In fact, we're not adding an temporary EMR cpu 
model while planing to complement it in the future. Instead, we are 
adding an official EMR cpu model. The fact is, in terms of the features 
that are virtualizable and can be exposed to guest, there is no 
difference between SPR and EMR.

This comes to a basic questionï¼šWill QEMU provide a EMR cpu model even if 
no difference to SPR cpu model except the model number?
