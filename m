Incidentally, if we were going to evolve the migration API at all, then
it probably ought to start making use of the async job infrastructure
we have available. This is use by block jobs, and by the internal snapshot
commands, and was intended to be used for any case where we had a long
running operation triggered by a command. Migration was a poster-child
example of what its intended for, but was left alone when we first
introduced the job APIs.

The 'job-cancel' API would obsolete 'migrate-cancel'.

The other interestnig thing is that the job framework creates a well
defined lifecycle for a job, that allows querying information about
the job after completeion, but without QEMU having to keep that info
around forever. ie once a job has finished, an app can query info
about completion, and when it no longer needs that info, it can
call 'job-dismiss' to tell QEMU to discard it.

If "MigrationState" were associated a job, then it would thus have a
clear 'creation' and 'deletion' time.

With regards,
Daniel
