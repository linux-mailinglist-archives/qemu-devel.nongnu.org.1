That would mean that you need keep the BlockDriver borrowed as long as
you're using the mapping. It would work today, but as soon as I want to
cache mappings, it won't any more.

It's not BdrvChild that is refcounted on the C side, but
BlockDriverState. We definitely don't bdrv_ref()/unref() for each
request on the C side and we shouldn't on the Rust side either. The
refcount only changes when you modify the graph.

I'm not entirely sure how your block::Arc<T> is supposed to work. It
would be tied to one specific type (BlockDriverState), not generic.
Which probably means that it can't be a separate pointer type, but
BlockDriverState itself should just implement Clone with bdrv_ref().

Though that doesn't help here, obviously, because we have a BdrvChild.

Actually, I'm not aware of that many items. But yes, there is a TODO
item for the graph lock.

I think I'll have something like:

    pub struct BdrvChild {
        child: GraphLock<*mut bindings::BdrvChild>,
    }

where you can access the inner object either by calling a lock function,
or passing another graph lock guard that you already own. And for the
FFI boundary unsafe functions like "I promise I already own the lock".

Right, we can have multiple requests in flight.

The fix is easy here: Even though bindgen gives us a *mut, we only want
a immutable reference.

There is no mutable part in BochsImage, which makes this easy. The only
thing is the *mut bindings::BdrvChild, but we never dereference that in
Rust. It is also essentially interior mutability protected by the graph
lock, even though this isn't explicit yet.

But if we were to introduce a mutable part (I think we will add write
support to it sooner or later), then BqlRefCell or RefCell are
definitely not right. They would only turn the UB into a safe panic when
you have more than one request in flight. (Or actually, BqlRefCell
should already panic with just one request from an iothread, because we
don't actually hold the BQL.)

I don't really like the aesthetics of having two functions on the
Rust side for each C function, but I guess ugliness is expected in
bindings...

For the errno conversion functions, I'm still not sure that they should
only support trivial wrappers with no early returns. I reluctantly buy
your &dyn argument (though in C block drivers this is generally
duplicated code, too), but that's unrelated to error handling.

This one is part of a Result, too. But not a result that is directly
returned in both success and error cases, but where the error leads to
an early return. That is, an equivalent for the ubiquitous pattern:

    ret = foo();
    if (ret < 0) {
        return ret;
    }

    /* Do something with the successful result of foo() */
