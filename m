There has never been any ABI stability requirement for 'isapc'
as it is not a versioned machine type.

Migration is irrelevant unless someone steps forward to
commit to long term versioning of the machine type.

There are ways to get access to an old QEMU, but I would
not call them easy when compared to using the QEMU that
is shipped as standard by your distro.

For a while a tried to maintain an archive of old QEMU
versions built for modern distros and it was a surprisingly
painful exercise. We tend to forget just how often QEMU's
build gets broken by new compilers, or new glibc system
header changes, or other 3rd party packages. 

Telling users to find an old QEMU is not an attractive
proposition, except as a last resort.

With regards,
Daniel
