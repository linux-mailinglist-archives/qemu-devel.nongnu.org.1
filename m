Yes, I'm thinking about this too. In my live-TAP series, I don't migrate TAP
netdev in separate, but it's migrated as part of virtio-net device. I hope,
it should be possible to do something similar here.

So the good target interface for me now is one "migarate-fds" (or better named)
capability, which turns on the whole feature both for virtio-net and vhost-user-blk
devices (and probably future ones). With additional optional device parameters
to be able to disable fds-migration per-device.
