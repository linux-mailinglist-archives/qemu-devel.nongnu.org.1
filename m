That's correct.

The rationale I wrote in the commit message is that it is a 
long-standing behavior for the other scanout types.

You can also "infer" this from the fact that the specification mentions 
pageflip, though it is a convoluted way:

https://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.2/csd01/virtio-v1.2-csd01.html#x1-375001r381

If scanout flush is truly atomic, there is no point of performing 
pageflip and you can instead simply always use 
VIRTIO_GPU_CMD_TRANSFER_TO_HOST_2D for the visible framebuffer.

So, from the guest perspective, there are two options to implement scanout:

- Do pageflip to avoid tearing at cost of having two framebuffers and
   late display.
- Do not pageflip to avoid having two buffers and display the content
   as soon as possible though it may cause tearing.

Allowing tearing to occur when not doing pageflip is a common sensible 
design (e.g., EGL: eglSwapInterval() with 0 as the interval parameter, 
Vulkan: VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE_KHR), though I see other things 
lacking in the design (e.g., vsync).

crosvm performs no synchronization and prone to tearing if I read it 
correctly. A code comment says:

https://chromium.googlesource.com/crosvm/crosvm/+/51cf0f429d64bd24281d9c9920c6712c491b5473/gpu_display/src/display_wl.c#1238

I suppose they care the Wayland passthrough more than the plain scanout 
mechanism. It will be nice if the specification clearly documents the 
expected behavior. The current documentation is more like saying "use 
the common sense and see QEMU if not sure"; it doesn't help much when 
writing QEMU.
