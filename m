Hi Davidlohr,

Seems the release has been tagged, so I've just rebased and pushed
out a draft tree as cxl-2025-12-23-draft
Draft because it is very very lightly tested so far.

On that I've merged in these patches with a few tweaks + added the
table test updates.  If you get a minute to take a look please do.

It's behind a couple of left over series from earlier cycles but my
intent is to post it for reviews prior to merge shortly.  That
may not include in the restrictions control qapi as I think that interface
may need more thought.  For now I've added a patch that just enables
BI always for CFMWSes.

Jonathan
