Thank you! It's clear and I see the difference.

Yes, it's the core difference. I think it's better to have a helper
clearly define the mapping between QEMU general topo level v.s. AMD topo
types, similar to cpuid1f_topo_type().

Yeah, this makes sense. CCD->die, and CCX->tile.

With your nice clarification, I think this problem has become a bit easier.

In fact, we can consider that CCD=CCX=die is currently the default
assumption in QEMU. When future implementations require distinguishing between
these CCD/CCX concepts, we can simply introduce an additional "smp.tiles" and
map CCX to it. This may need a documentation or a compatibility option, but I
believe these extra efforts are worthwhile.

And "smp.tiles" means "how many tiles in a die", so I feel it's perfect
to describe CCX.

SDM has "diedrp" but currently no product is using it. So it's hard for me
to say what this layer will look like in the future, especially with
topology-aware features/MSRs. Therefore, I prefer to add the "tile" if
needed, as it aligns better with the existing hierarchy definition. Anyway,
this is the future topic (though it is related with the last statement in your
commit message). At least for now, how to map the AMD hierarchy is fairly
clear.

Thanks,
Zhao
