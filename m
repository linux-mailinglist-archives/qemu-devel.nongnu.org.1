I don't see anything stopping postcopy_start() from being called in the
source in relation to multifd recv threads being setup in the
destination. So far it seems possible that the source is opening the
preempt channel while multifd still hasn't seen all threads. There's
also pre-7.2 machines which create the postcopy channel early.

Peekable means it can read ahead and rollback without consuming that
part of the stream. We need it because there's code later on that will
validate the MAGIC.

I thought you meant the CH_MAIN stuff. So now I don't know what you
mean. You want to do away with multifd?

Yes, as we're seeing, there's this assumption that multifd is never
enabled along with postcopy_preempt. Now with multifd+postcopy we need
to be careful to stop the places where that assumption was made.

Continue with this patch and fix the stuff I mentioned. You can ignore
the first two paragraphs of that reply.

https://lore.kernel.org/r/87y0y4tf5q.fsf@suse.de

I still think we need to test that preempt + multifd scenario, but it
should be easy to write a test for that once the series is in more of a
final shape.

We can't add magic values, as we've discussed.
