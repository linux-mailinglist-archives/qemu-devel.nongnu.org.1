v6: Rebase + no longer have any comments on patch v6 that
should be below the --- cut mark, so issue from v5 fixes.

Michael has queued all but last set of dependencies but listing everything
here that isn't yet upstream for completeness. Note comemnt on the second
to last series where only part of series should be picked up.

Based on:
[PATCH 0/2] hw/cxl: CDAT file handling fixes.
[PATCH v2 0/3] hw/cxl: Fix decoder commit and uncommit handling
[PATCH 0/3] docs/cxl: Gathering of fixes for 8.0 CXL docs.
[PATCH v5 0/3] hw/mem: CXL Type-3 Volatile Memory Support
[PATCH v5 0/6] hw/cxl: Poison get, inject, clear #Patches 1 and 2
[PATCH v6 0/4] hw/cxl: Poison get, inject, clear

Cover letter from earlier version

One challenge here is striking the right balance between lots of constraints
in the injection code to enforce particular reserved bits etc by breaking
out all the flags as individual parameters vs having a reasonably concise
API.  I think this set strikes the right balance but others may well
disagree :)   Note that Ira raised the question of whether we should be
automatically establishing the volatile flag based on the Device Physical
Address of the injected error. My proposal is to not do so for now, but
to possibly revisit tightening the checking of injected errors in future.
Whilst the volatile flag is straight forwards, some of the other flags that
could be automatically set (or perhaps checked for validiaty) are much more
complex. Adding verification at this stage would greatly increase the
complexity of the patch + we are missing other elements that would interact
with this.  I'm not concerned about potential breaking of backwards compatibility
if it only related to the injection of errors that make no sense for a real
device.

CXL Event records inform the OS of various CXL device events.  Thus far CXL
memory devices are emulated and therefore don't naturally generate events.

Add an event infrastructure and mock event injection.  Previous versions
included a bulk insertion of lots of events.  However, this series focuses on
providing the ability to inject individual events through QMP.  Only the
General Media Event is included in this series as an example.  Other events can
be added pretty easily once the infrastructure is acceptable.

In addition, this version updates the code to be in line with the
specification based on discussions around the kernel patches.
