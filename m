Would it call "migrate-pause" on both sides?

I believe the problem we hit was, when during postcopy and the NIC was
misfunctioning, src fell into postcopy-paused successfully but dest didn't,
stuck in postcopy-active.

We'll want to make sure both sides to be kicked into paused stage to
recover.  Otherwise dest can hang in the stage for hours until the watchdog
timeout triggers.

I agree adjusting timeout is not the best.

If we can have solid way to kick two sides out, I think indeed we don't
need to change the timeout.

If not, we may still need to provide a way to allow user to try continue
when the user found that the network is behaving abnormal.

Here adjusting timeout is slightly better than any adhoc socket timeout
that we'll adjust: it's the migration timeout, and we only have two cases:
(1) precopy, which is ok to fail and retried, (2) postcopy, which is also
ok to fail and recovered.

The timeout made some corner cases more aggressive to converge to a
failure/retry condition, but since we know exactly the property of the
sockets so it's better than when we know nothing about what the sockets are
used for.

Thanks,
