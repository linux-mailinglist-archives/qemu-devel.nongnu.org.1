You don't need to access it via the /node/ hierarchy

The canonical path for CPUs would be

  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuNNN/topology

The core_cpus_list file is giving you hyper-thread siblings within
a core, which I don't think is what you want.

If you're after discrete physical packages, then 'package_cpus_list'
gives you all CPUs within a physical socket (package) I believe.

That won't cope with asymmetrical CPU configurations, so I think it
is preferrable to read the info from sysfs.

Daniel
