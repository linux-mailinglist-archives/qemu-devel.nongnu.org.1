This seems to be continuing down the path of "oh, if we just
tweak this condition here it seems to whack this particular
mole on the head". What I'm asking for is a more holistic
view of what we're trying to achieve and what the "right"
design for that ought to be, not for small patches that
add more ad-hoc adjustments to where we are currently.
