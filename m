Shouldn't we focus more on how we want to write a QOM device in Rust 
instead, by making abstraction of existing C implementation first?
Once we have satisfying idea, we could evaluate how it maps to existing 
implementation, and which compromise should be made for efficiency.

It seems that the current approach is to stick to existing model, and 
derive Rust bindings from this.

I agree this glue can be a source of technical debt, but on the other 
side, it should be easy to refactor it, if we decided first what the 
"clean and idiomatic" Rust API should look like.

A compromise where you have to manually translate some structs, or copy 
memory to traverse languages borders at some point, could be worth the 
safety and expressiveness.

While it is important that this glue code is maintainable and looks 
great, I don't think it should be the main reason to accept usage of a 
new language.

I agree with this point that you made on the original RFC series from 
Manos. Just calling qemu C API through unsafe code is not making the 
best possible usage of Rust.

It could be an interesting thing to explore. Is the best solution to use 
specific traits (no callbacks involved from Rust code), or should we 
have Rust closures that mimic this behavior.

We could have a specific trait with functions to handle various kind of 
events. And the glue code could be responsible to translate this to 
callbacks for the C side (and calling Rust code accordingly, eventually 
serializing this on a single thread to avoid any race issues).
