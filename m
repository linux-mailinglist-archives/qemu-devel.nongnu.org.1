it's just idling VM that doesn't do anything, hence the question.

I guess it needs to be figured out to decide if it's safe to ignore (and not print error)
or if it's a genuine error/bug somewhere

If adding AMD's MSRs is not difficult, then I'd make it priority.
This way users (and libvirt) won't have to deal with 2 different
feature-sets and decide when to allow this to be turned on depending on host.

in worst case VCPUs might be moved between sockets many times during
sample window, can you explain how that is accounted for?

Anyways, it would be better to have some numbers in doc that would
clarify what kind of accuracy we are talking about (and example
pinned vs unpinned), or whether unpinned case measures average
temperature of patients in hospital and we should recommend
to pin vcpus and everything else.

Also actual usecase examples for the feature should be mentioned
in the doc. So users could figure out when they need to enable
this feature (with attached accuracy numbers). Aka how this
new feature is good for end users and what they can do with it.

one can collect the same data from vcpu thread as well,
the bonus part is that we don't have an extra thread
hanging around and doing work even if guest never asks
for those MSRs.

This also leads to a question, if we should account for
not VCPU threads at all. Looking at real hardware, those
MSRs return power usage of CPUs only, and they do not
return consumption from auxiliary system components
(io/memory/...). One can consider non VCPU threads in QEMU
as auxiliary components, so we probably should not to
account for them at all when modeling the same hw feature.
(aka be consistent with what real hw does).
