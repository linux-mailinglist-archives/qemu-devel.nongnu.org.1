The help desperately needs some cleanup like this, so thank you for
doing something about it.

You mean qemu-img-cmds.hx? The one advantage it has is that it makes it
obvious if there is a mismatch in the options we show in the help output
and in the documentation.

But I'm not overly concerned either way. I would probably have left it
alone just because leaving it is less work than changing it and the
result isn't very different.

I think it's better not to touch things like this. qemu-img is much more
likely to be used directly by human users (and their small scripts) than
QEMU itself, so we need to be even more careful with deprecating things.

In fact, I'm not even sure if combining them would make it easier to
use. Often, it's only source _or_ target that have a complicated setup
that requires blockdev-type descriptions. As a human user, I prefer if I
can still just use the file name for the other image instead of getting
the full -blockdev verbosity there, too.

For those commands where there is a source and a target, --source-format
and --target-format have a clear advantage, they are easy to remember
and hard to confuse.

For compare, as you saw, there is no clear naming. 1/2 or a/b don't make
the command any clearer than -f/-F. So maybe just don't add long
versions there?

These seem obvious. (Actually, --target-options vs. just --options isn't
completely obvious - after all, there are fundamentally no create
options for source.)

--source-* are also a bit weird because 'qemu-img convert' takes
multiple source images and then it applies the same format to all of
them. But that's more about how it works, so not a problem with the
option _name_.

>     --target-image-opts - this shold go IMHO

This one less so. Even generally speaking, changing interfaces
incompatibly comes with a cost that is probably too big to justify it
just for interfaces that look a bit nicer, but don't provide any new
functionality.

And as I said above, I don't agree that image-opts should be global.

It's a bit messy because the cache mode options -T/-t work the opposite
way of -f/-F. But I think the commands are consistent with each other?

-T was added as a source cache parameter to all of the subcommands at
the same time, in commit 40055951a.

Yeah, let's not make this more complicated than it has to be.
