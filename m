Alignment bits are the least significant bits that must be 0 in order to enforce a 
particular alignment.  The specific alignment is requested via MO_ALIGN et al as part of 
the guest memory reference.

I think the piece you're missing is the softmmu fast path test in the generated code.

We begin by indexing the tlb to find an entry.  At that index, the entry may or may not 
match because (1) we have never looked up the page so the entry is empty, (2) we have 
looked up a different page that aliases, or (3) the page is present and (3a) correct, or 
(3b) invalidated, or (3c) some other condition that forces the slow path.

The target address and the comparator have several fields:

   page address   [63 ... TARGET_PAGE_BITS]
   page flags     [TARGET_PAGE_BITS - 1 ... TARGET_PAGE_BITS - 5]
   unused         [TARGET_PAGE_BITS - 6 ... align_bits], or empty.
   alignment      [align_bits - 1 ... 0], or empty

In the comparator, the unused and alignment bits are always zero; the page flags may be 
non-zero in order to force the comparison to fail.

In the target address, we mask the page flags and unused bits; if the alignment bits of 
the address are set, then the address is of course unaligned and so the comparison fails.

In order for all this work, the alignment field cannot overlap the page flags.

The maximum alignment currently used by any guest is 5 bits, for Arm Neon,
which means the minimum value for TARGET_PAGE_BITS_MIN is 10.
