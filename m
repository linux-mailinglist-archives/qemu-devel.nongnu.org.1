The U bit is a red herring here -- it indicates a property of the
implementation, not of the topology. It is an almost obsolete
bit that might have been useful on 32-bit cores (eg the A9 had
a UP version and an MP version; we only implement the MP version,
and the Cortex-R5 sets the U bit). I think any modern CPU will have
U=0, whether it happens to be the only CPU in the system or not.

I think the answer here is "guest software doesn't rely on the Aff
fields to indicate topology". See eg this patch from back in 2020
to the kernel:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-arm-kernel/patch/20200829130016.26106-1-valentin.schneider@arm.com/
(now kernel commit 3102bc0e6ac752cc5) which notes that the amount
of implementation leniency in the Aff* definitions and some of
the odd stuff that has been shipped in practice means that you
can't get useful topology information out of the MPIDR (which is
why we provide it in the ACPI/dtb).

On the QEMU side I guess we should strive to set up the MPIDR
fields to something plausibly matching the topology as defined
by the user on the command line. Unanswered questions:

 * I guess we need some kind of back-compat thing where for
   old machine types we continue to report the old MPIDR
 * what are the constraints on the Aff* fields (eg that kernel
   commit suggests Aff0 shouldn't be > 15)?
 * should user attempts to eg ask for a topology with threads > 1
   but a CPU type which isn't multithreaded be an error?
   (What is the existing QEMU x86 practice here?)
