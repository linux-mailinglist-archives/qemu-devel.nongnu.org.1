is that a correct understanding that with the current implementation, in
nested mode, you end up with combined S1 + S2 entries (IOVA -> PA) and
S2 entries (IPA -> PA)?
Out of cusiosity, how did you end up with that choice? Have you made
some perf assessment compared to separate S1 and S2 entries? I guess it
is a complex topic and choice.

Thanks
