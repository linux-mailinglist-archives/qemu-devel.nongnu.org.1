They are different concepts. Frontend is defined in the vhost-user spec
and driver is defined in the VIRTIO spec.

The frontend is the application that uses vhost-user protocol messages
to communicate with the backend.

The driver uses VIRTIO device model interfaces like virtqueues to
communicate with the device.
