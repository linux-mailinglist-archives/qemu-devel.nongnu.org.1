'auto-read-only' is very likely not the problem here. Due to the name
it's often suspected but it's really a red herring mostly.

What it does is that it instructs qemu just to automatically switch
between read-only and read-write as it did in the pre-blockdev era.

Okay, based on what you've wrote I'm now even more confused what you
wanted to do.

Based on previous report [1] you wanted to migrate with non-shared
storage (presence of --copy-storage-all which copies all read-write
disks to destination).

But now ...

... this looks like shared storage ...

... and especially since you added it via the qemu:arg backdoor, which
libvirt doesn't in any way interpret, it'd mean that --copy-storage-all
fully ignores what was declared here.

Thus it's weird that this would actually help anything especially when
you originally used option meant for non-shared storage.

So, how did you migrate this? What did you want to achieve?

> Could anyone please clarify from libvirt side what is the change required?

You need to first clarify what you are actually doing. This seems to be
different from what you tried last time.

For any further investigation I'll need:

 - the full XML of the VM
 - debug logs from the source [2]
 - debug logs from the destination
 - description what you are trying to achieve
