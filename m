Hi,

This series tries to (partly) synchronize the lockless IO of the C HPET
to Rust HPET, and deploy Migratable<>/ToMigrationState to HPET.

It's "partly" because this series only uses Mutex<> to protect registers
and doesn't add SeqLock.

This series is based on master branch at the commit 9febfa94b69b ("Merge
tag 'for-upstream' of https://repo.or.cz/qemu/kevin into staging"). And
you can also find the code here:

https://gitlab.com/zhao.liu/qemu/-/tree/rust-hpet-refactor-v1-11-11-2025

Thanks for your review!


Overview
========

1. Replacing BqlRefCell<single register> with Mutex<HPETregisters>
------------------------------------------------------------------

In fact, the most part of this series is to convert
BqlCell<single register> to BqlRefCell<HPETRegisters>. The difference
between the two includes:
 * BqlCell<> is used for quick access but BqlRefCell<> would involve
   the reference with bigger scope.
 * BqlRefCell<> doesn't allow multiple borrowing, which requires to take
   care about lifetime management.
 * Placing all registers in HPETRegisters makes it more complex to
   justify reference lifetime.

However, once the conversion is complete, we only need to borrow
BqlRefCell<> once during MMIO read/write operations. This makes replacing
BqlRefCell<> with Mutex<> a straightforward way.

And to address BQL context issue during lockless IO (like commit
d99041a20328 ("hpet: guard IRQ handling with BQL")), this series
introduce BqlGuard to provide BQL context by hand.

But there's "difference": Rust HPET has stronger BQL guarantees and it
uses BqlCell<> and BqlRefCell<> for many fields of HPETState, so that
Rust HPET needs to provide BQL context for more cases that C HPET (which
just guards IRQ handling). More details, please review Patch 22.


2. Leverage Migartable<> and ToMigrationState
---------------------------------------------

This series uses Migratable<> twice:
 * Patch 20 applies Migratable<> for BqlRefCell<>.
 * Patch 21 applies Migratable<> for Mutex<>.

Migrable<> and ToMigrationState work well at the above cases.

But there's one thing still missing (I just remember this when I'm writng
this cover letter):
 * ToMigrationState for Timer

The timer's ToMigrationState would be added in v2 or in a seperate
patch.


Open Question
=============

I'm still a bit unsure - can we provide a property option to control
whether ToMigrationState automatically generates VMState, for simple
case without version/subsection consideration?

In this series, I implemented VMState for HPETTimerRegistersMigration
and HPETRegistersMigration by hand. But doing such thing by hand for the
generated struts seems not natural enough.


Thanks and Best Regards,
Zhao
