In all of the scenarios in concern or I've tried so far it's the case 
actually, but on the other hand I do understand this is rather a bold 
assumption that might not be future proof or even safe for now. Put it 
the other way, if there's a case that makes overlap ever occur after 
memory layout is stabilized, then we probably should have gotten such 
bug report way earlier with the current upstream QEMU, without this 
series of change of moving page pinning to device initialization, right. 
Otherwise it's also considered a bug in upstream SVQ code base, 
but practically I have no reproducer that triggers the problematic code 
with overlapped / aliasing.

Yes, ideally we shouldn't do that. Just wondered if there's sort of a 
simple way to tackle the problem and make it work with certain limited 
scenario (e.g. virtio-net doesn't use overlapped region, or we don't 
enable SVQ until memory is stabilized). Given that we haven't heard of 
issue before due to the overlap case not being unhanded, just saying 
maybe there's possibility to keep that assumption (overlaps are 
transient only) around for a short while, until a full blown fix can be 
landed?
