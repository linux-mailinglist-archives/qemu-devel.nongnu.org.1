Thank you Markus for your nice summary! I also apologize to you and
Philippe if I didn't understand correctly (I tried to look at
Pierrick's and Philippe's work, but still worry about I may have wrong
understanding :-) )

I see.

And I notice Philippe has 2 patches:

(1) For QAPI, this is to drop target-specific cond:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20250429100419.20427-1-philmd@linaro.org/

I feel it's a smart way to make it optional.

(2) Not for QAPI, but this is try to add runtime check:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20250502214551.80401-5-philmd@linaro.org/

I am thinking about how kvm-pmu-filter could be aligned with these
current efforts in mail list.

I can drop all the target conditions for KvmPmuEventFormat:

    { 'enum': 'KvmPmuEventFormat',
      'data': ['raw', 'x86-select-umask', 'x86-masked-entry'] }

This is what you listed before and it is similar to the way in (1). But
only (1) is not enough because I can't make these formats as optional
(pls educate me if I'm wrong :-) ).

Therefore, I think I need run-time check like Philippe did in (2), in
my kvm-pmu.c file. Do you think so?

An additional question - about CONFIG_KVM - is that I see that it's all
currently focused on solving target-specific problems, and I understand
that it's not yet kvm-specific's turn.

But kvm-pmu-filter does (or, may :-) ) need CONFIG_KVM. My initial
thought is, is it possible to remove the CONFIG_KVM condition for
kvm-pmu-filter in QAPI and use the same runtime check? But this would
require accel-info as Philippe's work on target-info in [2]).

> We can certainly discuss this some more, but I'd prefer to review a
> working solution instead.

With so many options on the table, I'm a bit confused about the fate of
kvm-pmu-filter. Should this case wait for the most appropriate option to
come along, or could it move forward based on the status quo, and then
consider the refactoring later with the final optimal option?

Zhao
