I think currently that makes quite a lot of demands on the translator to
make sure things are kept consistent.

We have been talking about maybe enabling hypercalls of some sort to
allow for hooking explicit function boundaries in linux-user. A natural
extension of that would be for host library bypass functions. I'm unsure
of how that would apply in system emulation mode though where things are
handled on a lot more granular level.

If the right access helpers are used we eventually end up in cputlb and
the code modification detection code will kick in. But that detection
mechanism relies on the guest controlled page tables marking executable
code and honouring rw permissions. If plugins don't honour those
permissions you'll become unstuck quite quickly.

It's not a hard no - but I think any such patching ability would need a
quite a bit of thought to make sure edge cases are covered. However I do
expect there will be downstream forks that go further than the upstream
is currently comfortable with and if the code is structured in the right
way we can minimise the pain of re-basing.
