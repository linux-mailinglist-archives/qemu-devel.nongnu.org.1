Hi all - Just a note to say that I am dealing with an ongoing family health
crisis and I have been away from my desk for extended periods of time, and
not reliably available for normal maintainership duties.

The python tests appear to be in a bad state at present and I have sent a
series to fix the bulk of it, but there is work that remains to be done. If
you run into any issues, please document them and CC me so that I can fix
anything else when I return.

(I am well aware that the lack of pinned versions for these tests when run
locally is proving to be a major pain. I have plans to address this, but
simply have not found the dedicated time to push the changes through yet.
In the meantime, as long as any always-run, must-pass tests on GitLab are
green, that should be sufficient for now until I get improvements merged
for the optional-run and locally-run tests; ideally merging everything into
"make check" and using the increasingly-not-new-anymore buildtime configure
venv with more robustly pinned tool versions.)

The new sphinx documentation project has also been delayed as a result,
though I have been collaborating with Markus off-list to hammer out some of
the nits that prevent the next RFC from being mailed out; work is still
actively ongoing and progress is being made, albeit slowly. I will return
to discussions concerning Sphinx versions et al when I return -- Sorry that
I did not respond to that topic of discussion yet; you have all been very
kind to participate in that discussion after my KVM Forum talk where I
mentioned the difficulty of targeting a wide range of Sphinx versions, and
I feel it has been rude to not participate in that thread yet. Thank you
for your patience there - I meant to "strike while the iron is hot", but
circumstances have had other plans for me.

In my absence, please feel free to merge whatever you'd like if it's
becoming a blocker and you cannot wait for my input -- I'll sort out any
accidental only-python-people-would-care mess when I return. I trust the
judgment of the iotests, qapi and build system maintainers :)

(Ideally, just make sure "python-check-minreqs" on gitlab is green and that
"make check-tox" passes, once the patches I mentioned above are merged. If
getting check-tox to pass is too fiddly, it's okay to let it regress in
order to fix a blocker elsewhere and I'll sort it out later.)

I hope to be back to normal within two weeks or so, with efforts in the
meantime sporadic and unreliable. Feel free to reach out with questions,
but I may not be prompt in dealing with "emergencies", so please use your
best judgment.

Thanks everyone,
--jsnow
