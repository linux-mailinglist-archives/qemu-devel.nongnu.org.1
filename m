Ok, so modifying the commit message and removing the 'error'
initialisation it is. Maybe mention the cluster validation case in the
comment here to explain why we do this even for non-pr-manager cases,
but not as a FIXME or TODO because it's not a problem with the
implementation, but we don't have any other choice. Right?

Should I send a v2 for this or is it okay to do this only while applying
the patch?

Kevin
