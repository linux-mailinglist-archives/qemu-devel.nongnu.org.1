I can't claim all the credits :) Most of the low level work was done by maxv,
the author of NVMM. IIRC I updated the local patch and modified it to work
with the newer build framework and committed it into the tree. I have to admit
I haven't contributed more since but I still use Qemu daily, with the NVMM
accelerator :) It makes such a big difference.

As pkgsrc normally tracks releases and has a directory with local patches on
top of that, build errors only show up when we bump the version. Version 10.2
is now in pkgsrc though I am running 10.1.3 so there is surely interest in
keeping it running. I could try to commit some more trivial patches in the
repo here to reduce the diffs some more.

Thanks for the feedback,
Reinoud
