IIUC, essentially all QEMU errors that could possibly be seen with
query-sev-capabilities are "GenericError" these days, except for
the small possibility of "CommandNotFound".

The two scenarios with lack of SEV support are covered by GenericError
but I'm concerned that other things that should be considered fatal
will also fall under GenericError.

eg take a look at qmp_dispatch() and see countless places where we can
return GenericError which ought to be treated as fatal by callers. 

IMHO  "SEV not supported" is not conceptually an error, it is an
expected informational result of query-sev-capabilities, and thus
shouldn't be using the QMP error object, it should have been a
boolean result field.
