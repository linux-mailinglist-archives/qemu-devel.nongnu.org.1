QEMU configurations must never be assumed to be migratable by default.
There is a huge set of things that a user must do with QEMU configuration
to guarantee migratability beyond CPU features. All aspects of guest HW
device topology must be set explicitly.

Setting "enforce" will break existing use of QEMU. It is valid to launch
QEMU with a CPU model that is not fully supported by the host, allowing
QEMU to disable unsupported features automatically.

Users who directly launch QEMU are expected to know about QEMU config
details for migration. If they don't, then they ought to be using a
higher level tool like libvirt, which ensures the configuration is
migration compatible.
