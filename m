Revert "gitlab-ci: Disable the riscv64-debian-cross-container by default"
This reverts commit f51f90c65ed7706c3c4f7a889ce3d6b7ab75ef6a.

riscv64 in debian has been non-functioning for almost a year, after the
architecture has been promoted to release architecture and all binary
packages started to be re-built, making the port not multi-arch-co-installable
for a long time (in debian, multi-arch packages must be of the same version,
but when a package is rebuilt on one architecture it gets a version bump too).
Later on, debiah had a long time64_t transition which made sid unusable for
quite some time too.  Both such events happens in debian very rarely (like,
once in 10 years or so - for example, previous big transition like that was
libc5 => libc6 transition).  Now both of these are finished (where qemu is
concerned anyway).

Hopefully debian unstable wont be very unstable.  At the very least it is
better to have sporadic CI failures here than no riscv64 coverage at all.

v2: drop a TODO comment which turned out to be confused, replacing it
 with the description why debian riscv64 were unusable.
