I have been discussed about semantics, not functionality and both of 
them matter.

Functionally, the ordering of container/subregion finalization matters 
if some device tries to a container during finalization. In such a case, 
removing subregions from the container at random timing can result in an 
unexpected behavior. There is little chance to have such a scenario but 
we should stay the safe side if possible.
