Right, you suggested new comand line options (level) and I simply
*mentioned* that we should pay attention to not affect that CI job. The
rest of the exchange is just me trying to clarify. I was not using this
as an argument against your idea.

Sure, we could add code around it if we wanted indeed.

It's the other way around. If we add --full, then compat will be !full,
so it will start running less tests. This is a "breaking change" of
sorts, but since the whole point of the series is to run less stuff in
general, then I think it's aligned with the plan.

Yeah, I can't deal with subverting -m slow. My initial version had this
and it didn't felt right. Maybe in 2025 I'll be a new man and we can do
differently. Let's see =)
