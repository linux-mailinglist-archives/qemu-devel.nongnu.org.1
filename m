Please make sure it's built by .gitlab-ci.d/ so that the continuous
integration system prevents bitrot. You can add a job that runs the
cargo build.

Performance will become more important when large amounts of TCG data is
captured, as described in the project idea:
https://wiki.qemu.org/Internships/ProjectIdeas/TCGBinaryTracing

While I can't think of a time in the past where simpletrace.py's
performance bothered me, improving performance is still welcome. Just
don't spend too much time on performance (and making the code more
complex) unless there is a real need.

I have not seen a satisfying way to natively build Rust code using
meson. I remember reading about a tool that converts Cargo.toml files to
meson wrap files or something similar. That still doesn't feel great
because upstream works with Cargo and duplicating build information in
meson is a drag.

Calling cargo from meson is not ideal either, but it works and avoids
duplicating build information. This is the approach I would use for now
unless someone can point to an example of native Rust support in meson
that is clean.

Here is how libblkio calls cargo from meson:
https://gitlab.com/libblkio/libblkio/-/blob/main/src/meson.build
https://gitlab.com/libblkio/libblkio/-/blob/main/src/cargo-build.sh

There is no policy. My suggestion:

If you need a third-party crate then it's okay to use it, but try to
minimize dependencies. Avoid adding dependening for niceties that are
not strictly needed. Third-party crates are a burden for package
maintainers and anyone building from source. They increase the risk that
the code will fail to build. They can also be a security risk.

>=20
> Welcome your feedback!

It would be easier to give feedback if you implement some examples of
TCG binary tracing before rewriting simpletrace.py. It's unclear to me
why simpletrace needs to be rewritten at this point. If you are
extending the simpletrace file format in ways that are not suitable for
Python or can demonstrate that Python performance is a problem, then
focussing on a Rust simpletrace implementation is more convincing.

Could you use simpletrace.py to develop TCG binary tracing first?
