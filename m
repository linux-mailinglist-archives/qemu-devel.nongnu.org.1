Hi Kevin,
Sorry for the delay, my gmail filters will need some love to handle this
high-traffic mailing lists so I can catch replies ...

I think it is the cycle in the sftp_packet_read(), which was polling
until we got
something to read here:

https://gitlab.com/libssh/libssh-mirror/-/blob/master/src/sftp_common.c?ref=
_type=3Dheads#L75-L100

But I would have to retrace through the code as I already forgot where I
was looking to.

Note, that the sftp_recv_response_msg() function is new in master and
not yet in any released versions. The 0.11 version had processing directly
in the sftp_read() (and in each other function handling some responses).

https://gitlab.com/libssh/libssh-mirror/-/blob/stable-0.11/src/sftp.c?ref_t=
ype=3Dheads#L1200

Also the ssh_channel_poll() is called only when the file handle is in
non-blocking
mode (whatever it means). The qemu sets the blocking mode here:

https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/master/block/ssh.c#L805C1-L805C44

This means the execution goes directly into sftp_read_and_dispatch(), which
we discussed above as it does the blocking.

If we will write some test coverage for this, I think we can make sure it
keeps working. There is really nothing that libssh would do in the backgrou=
nd
so the stuff should not go wrong. We will just make sure to double-check
all the variables are a part of session and not scattered around as static
variables or thread local ones (I hope we don't have much of these though).

Sorry, I don't have much experience around this to bring any useful insight
here.

So going back to the original issue, is the proposed patch something that
could work for you in the short term before a better solution will be
implemented
or is there something we should change?

Jakub
