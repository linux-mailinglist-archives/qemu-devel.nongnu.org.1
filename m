The PipeWire and PulseAudio backends are used by a large number of users 
in the VFIO community. Removing these would be an enormous determent to 
QEMU.

Audio output from QEMU has always been problematic, but with the 
PulseAudio and later, the PipeWire interface, it became much more user 
friendly for those that wanted to configure the VM to output native 
audio into their sound plumbing.

I do not agree that ALSA is as useful as you state it is, it's dependent 
on the host system's audio hardware support. If the sound device doesn't 
support hardware mixing (almost none do anymore), or the bitrate/sample 
rate QEMU wishes to use, your out of luck.

What I do think needs fixing here is the removal of the forced S16 audio 
format, and the resampler which forces all output to 48KHz. This though 
would require changes to the SPICE protocol as currently it is fixed at 
two channel 48KHz S16 also IIRC.

IMHO adding GStreamer is unnecessary, we have the modern PipeWire 
interface which is compatible with everything. I see absolutely no 
reason to add so much complexity to the project for little to no gain.

Geoffrey McRae (gnif)
