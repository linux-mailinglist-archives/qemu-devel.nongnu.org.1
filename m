Here are my thoughts:

- Type annotations are probably not copyrightable. Although I think AI
  output contributions should be allowed for non-copyrightable work, I
  understand the slippery slope argument. Also, at QEMU Summit the
  consensus was to give it some time and then revisit the AI policy next
  year. I think we should stick to that so that the QEMU community has
  time to consider other scenarios involving AI. Then we can make a
  policy change next year that combines the new items that have come up
  rather than making a series of shifting policy changes over the coming
  months. That will make it simpler for everyone to understand and
  follow the policy correctly.

- Markus pointed out why generating them automatically may not result in
  the same quality as manually-written annotations because the AI
  doesn't have the context that is missing from the code itself. It's
  the same reason why generating API docs using AI produces something
  resembling documentation, but it consists of obvious stuff apparent
  from the code itself and not the context that only the author can
  communicate about the intended use of the API. The difference between
  manually-written type hints and AI-generated ones is probably less
  significant than with API documentation though, so I think they are
  sufficiently valuable and high quality enough to merge.
