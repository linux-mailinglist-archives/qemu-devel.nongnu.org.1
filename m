But that would mean, that we can't reconfigure a backend during live migration.

In my understanding, machine type properties are visible to the guest,
and that's why we can't change them for running vm, even during live
migration.

Bringing here another type of properties, which we _can_ change for
running vm (even if changing is not very comfortable for admin), will
be like tying ourselves hands.

And yes, there is a way to change any properties by qom-set. But it
lays out of paradigm of machine types, and normally we can't change
most of properties in flight.


Or in other words: if we _can_ go on only with migration parameters,
that actually shows, that what we are talking about is definitely
property of migration, not property of device.


And final note: if we can use one mechanism instead of two mechanisms,
it makes the architecture twice simpler. Trying to go on with _only_
device properties would mean run a bench of qom-set commands before
every migration (as we have to distinguish local and remote migrations
anyway), that looks bad. On the other hand, go on with _only_ migration
parameter is feasible and looks better.


And very final note: making global parameter + per-device parameters,
actually, global parameter become a workaround to the fact that we
don't want run a bench of qom-set commands. So, global parameter is
an additional API to hide inconvenience of the main API.
