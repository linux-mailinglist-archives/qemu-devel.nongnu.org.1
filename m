Well, I understand that if fixes the misbehaviour you encountered. But how
helpful would it be if it then breaks behaviour for other people instead?

I think it would be better to add a 2nd patch that would handle state chang=
es
in callback mode. That would satisfy both groups of people. AFAICS
snd_pcm_state() can be called both in polling mode and callback mode.

Just my 2 cents. Of course it's up to Gerd to decide.
