I'd vote, that in 99% (or more) cases, they don't reasonably disagree,
but blindly follow usual pattern of returning -errno together with
errp, while having no reasonable contract on concrete errno values,
and with this errno finally unused (used only to check, it is it < 0,
like boolean). In other words, the only contract they have is
"< 0 is error, otherwise success".
