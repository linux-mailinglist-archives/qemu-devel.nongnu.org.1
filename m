I guess it gets fuzzy because the general concept of machine types
is

  "what previously worked must still work in future, given an
   identical machine config".

Marc-andre's patch took something which was previously broken, and
made it work, for both new and pre-existing machine types, but only
if both sides used the new QEMU binary. This is somewhat unusual,
but probably not without precedent wrt other places where we have
removed historical blockers.

In this case, the patch is proposing to extend the above concept to
include "what was previously broken must remain broken", wrt pre-
existing machine types.

I have some sympathy for the latter proposal, because the way that
failures loading vmstate present themselves is very user hostile.

At least with migration you'll see the error after migration
completes, which is still "in the moment". If you're using a
save/restore workflow, as you might only discover this config
is not restorable on your desired older QEMU weeks or months
later.

IOW using an old machine type and the user config sometimes be
migratable and sometimes not migratable is poor user experiance
IMHO.
