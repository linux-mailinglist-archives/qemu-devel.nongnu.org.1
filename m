Yes, because "virt" is an alias for "virt-<current>".
Folks who rely on migration compatibility must use "virt-9.2" etc.

Thus having a global property set by version 9.2 compat which says "use qarma5 as default 
pac" will work.  It's a little backward having the version on the board, not the cpu, but 
we've done it before, as Peter mentioned re cpu clock time base.
