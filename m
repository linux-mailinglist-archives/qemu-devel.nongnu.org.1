I haven't look at the proposal yet, but indeed, we could introduce
a new TYPE_PNV_CORE type for big cores only.

Have you tried SMT8 on powernv8 ? I remember seeing a hang if I am correct.
I don't think POWER8 deserves much attention anymore, we could deprecate
POWER8E and POWER8NVL. However, we should at least report an error if we
know a setup is broken.

Thanks,

C.
