Having been through that recently, I agree with you that it can be hard 
to follow at first. Luckily, we have perfect compiler based completion 
for all editors those days (I sincerely hope everyone spent 2 hours 
configuring this on their own favorite one), and it's easy to see where 
things are defined and used, even when code is cryptic.

That said, pushing to someone adding a new field the responsibility of 
cleaning up the whole thing is not a fair request. You can't expect your 
friends to clean your shared house because they brought a cake for dinner.
