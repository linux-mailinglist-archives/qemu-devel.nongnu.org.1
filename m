Currently we have 'xres' and 'yres' properties set against the device
for virtio-gpu.

If we're going to extend  it to allow the name of each "output" head
to be configured, it makes sense to allow for a data structure that
will let us also cnofigure xres & yres per output.

Hence, I thought it would make more sense to have an array of structs,
rather than the simpler array of strings, which will let us set any
amount of per-output config data we might want in future.

NB, I'm not asking you to wire up support for xres/yres per output,
just that we anticipate it as a possibility.

I'd suggest putting it in virtio_gpu_base_device_realize, as we already
have code there to validate 'max_outputs" is within limits.


With regards,
