Basically you are saying this patch will have the effect that a 16-bit write to one of the USART registers such as USART_RTOR via an ARM instruction like STRH would not be handled correctly because value to be written will be zero extended to 32-bits before being written.

I have received a response from my contact Nicolas Fillon at STM, he wrote "I see we are making 16 bit access read and write to these 16 bit registers in our library for both HAL and LL so this should be a documentation issue."

I noticed in the Qemu source the RegisterAccessInfo struct and associated register_write_memory/register_write functions. These functions appear quite helpful to ensure that reserved bits are not written by using the ro field. I don't see very much usage of this paradigm in Qemu however, only Xilinx and USB DWC3 code appears to use it, but it seems a useful approach in many situations, especially for STM chips.

On the physical STM hardware, specifically the STM32L476, it allows writes smaller than 32-bit to 32-bit registers and does not fault or ignore them. In fact I noticed some very interesting byte duplication behavior, I tested the following code

  // USART_RTOR is a 32-bit register where every bit is r/w

  UartHandle.Instance->RTOR = 0xAAAABBBB;
  printf("USART1 RTOR 1: 0x%08"PRIx32"\n\r", UartHandle.Instance->RTOR);

  uint16_t *rtor_hw = (uint16_t *) &UartHandle.Instance->RTOR;
  rtor_hw[1] = (uint16_t) 0xCCCC;
  printf("USART1 RTOR 2: 0x%08"PRIx32"\n\r", UartHandle.Instance->RTOR);

  uint8_t *rtor_byte = (uint8_t *) &UartHandle.Instance->RTOR;
  rtor_byte[3] = (uint8_t) 0xDD;
  printf("USART1 RTOR 3: 0x%08"PRIx32"\n\r", UartHandle.Instance->RTOR);

  rtor_hw[0] = (uint16_t) 0xEEEE;
  printf("USART1 RTOR 4: 0x%08"PRIx32"\n\r", UartHandle.Instance->RTOR);

  // USART_BRR is a 32-bit register where only the lower 16-bit are r/w, the top 16-bits are reserved and read zero

  uint32_t *BRR32 = (uint32_t *) &USART2->BRR;

  *BRR32 = 0x11223344;
  printf("USART2 BRR 1: 0x%08"PRIx32"\n\r", *BRR32);

  uint16_t *brr_hw = (uint16_t *) BRR32;
  brr_hw[0] = (uint16_t) 0xCCCC;
  printf("USART2 BRR 2: 0x%08"PRIx32"\n\r", *BRR32);

  uint8_t *brr_byte = (uint8_t *) BRR32;
  brr_byte[1] = (uint8_t) 0xDD;
  printf("USART2 BRR 3: 0x%08"PRIx32"\n\r", *BRR32);

  /*
     OUTPUT:

     USART1 RTOR 1: 0xaaaabbbb
     USART1 RTOR 2: 0xcccccccc
     USART1 RTOR 3: 0xdddddddd
     USART1 RTOR 4: 0xeeeeeeee
     USART2 BRR 1: 0x00003344
     USART2 BRR 2: 0x0000cccc
     USART2 BRR 3: 0x0000dddd
   */

Notice how an 8-bit write of just 0xDD is duplicates to all words in the register, strange. I wonder if Qemu is interested in emulating this exact behavior, it doesn't seem particularly critical since the drivers provided by STM should never purposely write to fewer bits than are actually writable.
