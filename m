Hi,

* The trigger or reason can come from the place where we call
migration_change_state(), there we'll know whether migration has
paused OR completed OR failed OR cancelled.

* Even with branches, the process is still linear as it goes from
start to finish. Just that we can reach the end state via different
paths.

     shutting down, reason=crashed
     shutting down, reason=destroyed
     shutting down, reason=failed
     shutting down, reason=migrated
     shutting down, reason=shutdown
===
As we see, guest VM can stop/shutdown due to various reasons.

* Between [migration-start] and [migration-end], we can define
events/triggers that will lead to the next state. Ex

      - START -> t:connection-established -> ACTIVE

We can reach the ACTIVE state only after connections are established,
not without that. If connection establishment fails, we reach the END.

     - START  -> t:connection-established -> ACTIVE ->  running   -> END

ACTIVE ->  t:error     ->  END

ACTIVE ->  t:cancel  ->  END

ACTIVE ->  t:pause   ->  PAUSED  -> t:resume -> ACTIVE

* We are not doing away with migration states, just reducing or
rationalising them to make it easier. Emitting state change to
libvirtd(8) and internal tracking should still serve the same. Just
that in migration_is_running() etc. functions we'll check only if the
state is ACTIVE, instead of 10 other states which also indicate that
the migration is running.

* Well as I see it, different states help us to
      1 - know where the process is at a given time. In case of
errors/failures or other events to know what actions to take.
      2 - what actions/triggers/events are possible.

ex. If an error/cancel occurs before ACTIVE state, during connection
establishment, it may not have to go through migration_cleanup(),
probably there's nothing to cleanup. Vs if an error/cancel occurs
after ACTIVE  or in PAUSED state, we know migration_cleanup() is
needed.  Similarly if we receive t:resume command when in ACTIVE
state, OR receive t:pause command in PAUSED state,  we know there's
nothing to do and ignore it.

Thank you.
