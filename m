Don't understate the value of "grep"  :-)

It is my #1 tool when I see a string mentioned in bug report, whether
that's from error_report or warn_report.

What annoys/frustrates me is when the message (whether an eror or
warning) lacks the technical details of exactly what failed.

ie if the message doesn't substitute in either the errno value, or the
strerror string, or equivalent, then it massively reduces the chances
of diagnosis unless the bug is easily reproducible.

I agree that the latter is more informative for users, though for
developers it might be worse as such a generic message may provide
cover for several different low level problems. 

Neither help me diagnose the problem though if I see them in a bug
report though, because neither include the "WSAGetLastError()" value
(or its string equivalent).

Probably we deserve both. In the case of "Error" objects, we have
error_prepend so code can do

  error_setg(errp, "failed to WSAEventSelect: %s", WSAGetLastError())

and then the caller one or more levels up the stack can do

  error_prepend(errp, "unable to initialize slirp user mode networking")

which becomes useful when we see the final error_report() or equiv.

We don't have an error_prepend concept for warnings 

With regards,
Daniel
