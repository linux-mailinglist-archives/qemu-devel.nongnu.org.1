I just sent the formal version [*], could you please help verify if it 
resolve your problem?

(If you can share the step how to reproduce the original problem, I can 
test myself)

For i386 tcg, it allocates each CPU 3 MemoryRegions: cpu_as_root, 
cpu_as_mem and smram for SMM. While for i386 kvm, it allocates global 
MemoryRegions: smram_as_root and smram_as_mem and get smram from 
resolving "/machine/smram".

yeah, this seems something we can cleanup if there were not specific 
reason for TCG to have different MemoryRegion each CPU. I don't have 
bandwidth to investigate it further.
