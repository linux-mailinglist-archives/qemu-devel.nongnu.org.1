Right now a host device would have


  <hostdev mode='subsystem' type='mdev' model='vfio-pci'>
   ...
  </hostdev>

where model could also accept 'vfio-ccw' / 'vfio-ap' on s390x IIUC.

If the use of IOMMUFD has guest ABI feature differences, then we
would need to treat this as a new device model in libvirt, ie add
vfio-iommu-pci model.   Does thos iommufd work with vfio-ccw / vfio-ap
too ? If so we'd need new models for those too in libvirt.

The downside of this is that it means no appication is going to
use iommufd mode without having explicit coding done to make it
aware of the new model in libvirt.

If we /want/ apps to move over to iommufd approach in a finite
short timeframe then IMHO achieving feature parity is critical
as feature partiy would let libvirt switch over to it automatically
and avoid the pain of updating any apps. This would be my preference,
as exposing the iommufd concept to apps feels wrong - this is an
internal impl detail ideally. Again we must have feature parity
for this to work though.


With regards,
Daniel
