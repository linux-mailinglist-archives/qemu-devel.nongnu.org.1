I don't believe that probing could ever be a placement for (a). Determining
what you want to use is not a decision that can be made in isolation of
the current host. You need to know the capabilities of hosts that you
intend to be able to migrate to.

Machine type versions facilitate this as an admin can express the
compatibility constraint in terms of this high level opaque definition,
and not have to understand 100's of properties and their supportability
across many hosts.

The same applies to non-guest host compatibility settings. I might be
runing on a RHEL-9.6 host, but I want to have compatibility with any
RHEL-9.2 host or newer. I can't probe QEMU on the 9.6 host to determine
what is acceptable for 9.2. We need to be able to express that cross
host compatibility as an admin, without having to list a huge set of
individual properties.

With regards,
Daniel
