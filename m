'trace_event_register_group' is essentially irrelevant for the
fully dynamic trace backends like dtrace - that's only used for
the backends whose output is controlled by QEMU monitor commands
/ command line arguments.

In the dtrace case the binary gets instructions which are a squence
of nops normally, and dtrace tool gets the kernel to live patch the
binary at runtime to put in a jump for any probes that are being
watched.

Take a look at the generated files <build-dir>/trace/trace-*.h when
using the different '--enable-trace-backends=...' options.

eg taking the trace-crypto.h header, with 'log' backend we see it
emits

   if (trace_event_get_state(TRACE_QCRYPTO_TLS_SESSION_CHECK_CREDS) && qemu_loglevel_mask(LOG_TRACE)) {
#line 23 "../crypto/trace-events"
        qemu_log("qcrypto_tls_session_check_creds " "TLS session check creds session=%p status=%s" "\n", session, status);
#line 372 "trace/trace-crypto.h"
    }

but with dtrace it emits

    QEMU_QCRYPTO_TLS_SESSION_CHECK_CREDS(session, status);

which is a referencing a macro created by the external 'dtrace' binary,
which in the Linux case ends up looking like

  #if defined STAP_SDT_V1
  #define QEMU_QCRYPTO_TLS_SESSION_CHECK_CREDS_ENABLED() __builtin_expect (qcrypto_tls_session_check_creds_semaphore, 0)
  #define qemu_qcrypto_tls_session_check_creds_semaphore qcrypto_tls_session_check_creds_semaphore
  #else
  #define QEMU_QCRYPTO_TLS_SESSION_CHECK_CREDS_ENABLED() __builtin_expect (qemu_qcrypto_tls_session_check_creds_semaphore, 0)
  #endif
  __extension__ extern unsigned short qemu_qcrypto_tls_session_check_creds_semaphore __attribute__ ((unused)) __attribute__ ((section (".probes")));
  #define QEMU_QCRYPTO_TLS_SESSION_CHECK_CREDS(arg1, arg2) \
  DTRACE_PROBE2 (qemu, qcrypto_tls_session_check_creds, arg1, arg2)

you can end up enabling multiple trace backends concurrently too.

If you're thinking this is all rather complicated, you'd be right,
which is why for initial feature parity I figured the simplest is
likely to just wrap the existing QEMU inline probe function, so
Rust doesn't need to know about the different backends... yet...

FWIW, the original DTrace authors created a Rust crate with native
rust integration of dynamic probes.

  https://github.com/oxidecomputer/usdt

I think that (somehow) we probably want to integrate that with QEMU
and its tracetool.

With regards,
Daniel
