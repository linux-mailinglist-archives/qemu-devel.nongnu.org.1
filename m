Hello QEMU developers,

I understand from this page, https://wiki.qemu.org/License, that TCG is
being licensed permissively (BSD license) so it can be integrated as a
library in other projects, which is great! However, I'd like to know if the
CPU part of QEMU, no peripherals included, is also permissively licensed
(maybe BSD or some other permissive license such as LGPL, ...etc.)?

The reason I am asking this question is because projects such as the
Unicorn Engine would greatly benefit from a permissively licensed CPU
component so that the project itself (Unicorn Engine) is also released
under a permissive license, which would be great for people wanting to do
research with the Unicorn Engine but are tied with proprietary code (e.g.,
in proprietary university research projects). I have started a discussion
for that matter with the Unicorn Engine developers in their GitHub page,
https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn/issues/2114, and it would be
great to have a feedback regarding this matter from the official QEMU
developers, whether directly on the issue or a reply to this email and I'd
relay your response.


Kind regards,
Faisal Al-Humaimidi
