Oh, you can take this if you want, I'm just mentioning the pitfalls with
the abort command. While sequestoring command id's that are being
aborted may be good practice for the host, the spec doesn't say anything
about it. The Linux driver doesn't do that at least, though it recently
created a different mechanism to avoid immediate command id reuse.
