So the problem is probably using g_new() to allocate it. Maybe this should 
be object_new() instead? I was trying to figure out how this should work 
but not sure I understand everything. It looks like as long as the mr has 
a name, memory_region_init() will add the mr as a child property to the 
owner and unref it so the reference will be passed to the owner which will 
own this mr after that. On destructing the owner it will delete all its 
properties which should dereference the memory region so it would be freed 
then if it had a free function set but it seems allocating with g_new and 
init-ing the region with memory_region_init() won't set the free function. 
Only way to set that seems to be object_new() but that also inits the 
object so maybe using it would double init the mr or add an extra 
reference so that may also not work. The extra ref could be solved by 
unref'ing after memory_region_init() but double init seems to be 
unnecessary. Maybe we need a memory_region_new_* set of functions or 
simpler than that an object_alloc() that allocates the object without
init it that could be used in this case when init is done by other 
function like memory_region_init in this case?

But that way a lot of otherwise not needed fields would make the state 
struct more crowded and harder to see what's actually used there. Maybe 
this could be remedied by grouping these at the end below a comment but if 
ref counting worked as the docs state it this should not be necessary.

Before my cleanup the state strcut in raven.c looked like this:

struct PRePPCIState {
     PCIHostState parent_obj;

     OrIRQState *or_irq;
     qemu_irq pci_irqs[PCI_NUM_PINS];
     PCIBus pci_bus;
     AddressSpace pci_io_as;
     MemoryRegion pci_io;
     MemoryRegion pci_io_non_contiguous;
     MemoryRegion pci_memory;
     MemoryRegion pci_intack;
     MemoryRegion bm;
     MemoryRegion bm_ram_alias;
     MemoryRegion bm_pci_memory_alias;
     AddressSpace bm_as;
     RavenPCIState pci_dev;

     int contiguous_map;
};

which would become this after this series:

struct PREPPCIState {
     PCIHostState parent_obj;

     qemu_irq irq;
     MemoryRegion pci_io;
     MemoryRegion pci_discontiguous_io;
     MemoryRegion pci_memory;
     MemoryRegion pci_intack;
     AddressSpace bm_as;
};

if we don't have to keep regions we don't use after realize so those can 
be managed by QOM which is much more readable and comprehensible to me.

(Unrelated question but I'm still not sure what the bm_as is for. This 
seems to be present in some pci-hosts and may be needed for bus master 
cards but I just carried it over to my devices as a cargo cult without 
really getting why is it needed and why is it needed here and not in 
PCIHostState. Is there any explanation on that somewhere?)
