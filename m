Leaving half for loaded libraries, etc is quite conservative
if max_map_count is the small-ish 64k default.

That reservation could perhaps a fixed number like 5,000 ?

The awkward thing about this limit is that its hardcoded, and
since it is indeed a "heuristic", we know it is going to be
sub-optimal for some use cases / scenarios.

The worst case upper limit is

   num virtio-blk * num threads * num queues

Reducing the number of devices isn't practical if the guest
genuinely needs that many volumes.

Reducing the threads or queues artificially limits the peak
performance of a single disk handling in isolation, while
other disks are idle, so that's not desirable.

So there's no way to cap the worst case scenario, while
still maximising the single disk performance possibilities.

With large VMs with many CPUs and many disks, it could be
reasonable to not expect a real guest to need to maximise
I/O on every disk at the same time, and thus want to put
some cap there to control worst case resource usage.

It feels like it leans towards being able to control the
coroutine pool limit explicitly, as a CLI option, to override
this default hueristic.
