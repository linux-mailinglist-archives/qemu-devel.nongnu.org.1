Meta: it's a good idea to add a blank line before and after your reply
when replying inline like this, it makes it easier on the eyes to spot
the various snippets in a wall of text (note how this reply itself has
extra blank lines before and after it).

Possibly... as long as we don't lose the ability of running subsets of
tests in one command, i.e. "all postcopy tests", "all postcopy recovery
tests", etc.

Yes

We put a big comment somewhere and refer to it during review. Perhaps at
main(), right before the migration_test_add calls.

Ok. Please put this all together in a new version, make sure you mention
that you're not touching the old tests to preserve bisectability and
let's see what others think.
