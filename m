Well.  That is one possible approach (and this is what qemu is doing
today, for historical reasons, because most code dates back to pre
high-dpi days).

A possible alternative would be to go for fbw * scale_x = pw, i.e. let
the guest run in pixel coordinates instead of window coordinates.  The
guest would do the high-dpi scaling then.  That requires setting
physical display width and height in ui_info, so the guest can figure
what the display resolution is and go into high-dpi mode if needed.

We probably also need a non-high-dpi compatibility mode for old guests.
That mode would start with "zooming scale = global scale" instead of
"zooming scale = 1", and the dpi calculation would have to consider
that too.

(maybe best done on top of this nice cleanup).

take care,
  Gerd
