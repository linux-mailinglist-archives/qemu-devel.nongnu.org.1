Yes, that's utterly confusing and took me quite some time to discover it, after talking with Mathieu himself. They removed it explicitely to make the stack more simple. In short, for Realms, forget about OP-TEE.

Won't dare to blame you for it, we need to keep ourselves sane XD

You did a great work already putting it in a single place and using bash scripts as much as possible :)
