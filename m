I agree, but this is effectively what our docs are currently doing,
and what I'm trying to decouple with this patch...

I think that being vague like this is a disservice to our users.
If I'm a user of QEMU, I'd like to know whether I'm inside the
line or outside of it before I put my config into production,
not later on when it turns out there was an exploitable bug
that wasn't classified as a security issue...

Most devices can't in fact be used with KVM, because they're
sysbus devices that aren't used in the machines that you can
use with KVM. Pluggable devices are rarer (and yes, under
our current policy random PCI devices are effectively
in-scope).
