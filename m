With if (...) guards, compilers need not elide the call (although a
sufficiently smart optimizing compiler will).  Only #if guards remove
the need for stubs with certainty.

Guards can also be implicit.  For instance, when creation of some
(sub-)object always fails, then all its methods are unreachable.  This
can serve as guard for calls of stubs in the methods.

Of course, not compiling and linking unreachable code in the first place
is desirable, but sometimes the #if are just too bothersome.

Scratch ebpf_rss_is_loaded(), it doesn't take @errp.

Yes.

C code doesn't use CONFIG_EBPF.  Instead, compilation of certain C files
is conditional on the libbpf Meson dependency.

If the user requested EBPF by setting the property, we call
ebpf_rss_load_fds() via virtio_net_load_ebpf_fds().

If CONFIG_EBPF, this can fail.  It sets an error then.

Else, it will fail, and it won't set an error then.  Feels wrong.
Impact unclear.  To find out I'd have to figure out how to configure
virtio-net to make it attempt to use EBPF.

Convention: a function taking an @errp must set its @errp exactly when
it fails.

Does not apply when it abort()s.

I like unreachable stubs to abort().

ebpf_rss_load() and ebpf_rss_load_fds() are only called from
.get_features method virtio_net_get_features().  Reachability is not
obvious.  If we assume they are reachable, we need to make the two stubs
set an error.

ebpf_rss_set_all() is only called from virtio_net_commit_rss_config()
via virtio_net_attach_ebpf_rss().  virtio_net_attach_ebpf_rss() passes
null @errp, i.e. the errors set by ebpf_rss_set_all() are all lost.
virtio_net_attach_ebpf_rss() emits a generic warning on failure.  This
is crap.  Better: virtio_net_attach_ebpf_rss() passes on the error, so
that virtio_net_commit_rss_config() can include cause in the warning.

If we do that, we also need to fix the stub to set an error.

If we don't do it, we can just as well drop ebpf_rss_set_all()'s @errp
parameter.

I'm not sure I follow.

Only if we're willing to assume all compilers elide the calls even when
optimization is off.
