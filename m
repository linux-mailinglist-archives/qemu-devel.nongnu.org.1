After looking at the introspection code, I don't see any major blocker.
We need to keep some of existing "if", as they are based on config-host, 
and should apply.
We can introduce a new "available_if" (or any other name), which 
generates a runtime check when building the schema, or when serializing 
a struct.

This way, by modifying the .json with:
- if: 'TARGET_I386'
+ available_if: 'target_i386()'

This way, we keep the possibility to have ifdef, and we can expose at 
runtime based on available_if. So we can keep the exact same schema we 
have today per target.

I don't see any blocker with that. If you mention generating Rust and Go 
from qapi json definitions, it's already dependent on C preprocessor 
because of ifdef constant. So it will have to be adapted anyway.
Having the same function (target_i386()) name through different 
languages is not something hard to achieve.

Thus, the proposal above to do the same for concerned struct members.

It's nice to have this, and this is what would allow us to 
conditionnally include or not various definitions/commands/fields. I was 
a bit worried we would have a "static string", but was glad to find a 
static list instead.

The current target will be set at the entry of main() in QEMU, so before 
the monitor is created. Thus, it will be unambiguous.

I'll give a try at conditioning all this by runtime checks, so you can 
review which changes it would create.
