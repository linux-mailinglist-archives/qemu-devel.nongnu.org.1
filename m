Hmm. Offline, we observed that qemu's default of unlimited clients may
not be the smartest thing - if max-connections is not set, we may want
to default it to something like 100 (even when MULTI_CONN is
exploited, most clients that take advantage of it will probably only
use 8 or 16 parallel sockets; more than that tends to run into other
limits rather than providing continual improvements).  I can add such
a change in default in v4.  In contrast, qemu-nbd defaults to
max-connections 1 for historical reasons (among others, if you have a
non-persistent server, it is really nice that qemu-nbd automatically
exits after the first client disconnects, rather than needing to clean
up the server yourself), but that's too small for MULTI_CONN to be of
any use.
