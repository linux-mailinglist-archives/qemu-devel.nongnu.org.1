This can also happen when migrating the guest from a host that happens to have
an errata to one that doesn't have, regardless of the CPU type the guest
is using (host CPU vs vendor CPU). The guest would need a power cycle to
identify the current model ID.

We don't have the tooling needed to mitigate this risk in QEMU I'm afraid. Upper
layers like libvirt are more able to deal with it.

If we're really going this route we would need to match host and vendor CPU
in the extension level, matching each vendor CPU extension with what the
CPU can provide, failing if the host can't provide all extensions the vendor
CPU requires. I wouldn't even bother checking for things like machine ID since
they can be easily impersonated (e.g. use a rv64 emulated host, edit mvendorid)
and can't be trusted.

TBH I am not thrilled with the idea of supporting vendor CPUs with KVM. The user
can pick the 'host' CPU to have the most capable KVM CPU available in the host,
and that is already not trivial to support in cases like live migration and so
on. Vendor CPU KVM support will promote things like:

"I tried to use a veyron-v2 KVM CPU in a veyron-v1 host, why is that not possible
it should be it's not fair"

"why can't I use a vendor X KVM CPU A into a vendor Y CPU B host it surely should
work since CPU A is older than CPU B right"

And then, even if we decide to support vendor CPUs with KVM in a feasible way, with
a lot of conditions and training wheels, we'll be so restrictive that the user will
be better of using the 'host' CPU anyway.


All this said, there's a lot going on in this series already and this vendor CPU + KVM
discussion might deserve its own RFC/thread. I'll drop this patch from the series to
give us time to discuss this properly. Let's leave it as is for now.


Thanks,

Daniel
