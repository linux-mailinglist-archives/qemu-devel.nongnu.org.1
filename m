I have a need to run an old MSDOS 6.22 image with an application that
makes use of EMS 4.0.

After some extensive testing, it seems that DOS' EMM386 driver cannot
find a 64k page frame that it can use.  I can manually designate the
block beginning at D800 as a page frame but then shortly after start
the system hangs.

I have a test program that is used to determine if the system is seeing
the EMS as expected and this fails.

If anyone is interested in taking a look at this I'll provide the XML
for the VM, a config.sys as well as the EMSTEST program which can be
used to validate a proper environment.

If this is not the right place to raise this issue please point me in
the proper direction.

Many thanks,

Dan Srebnick
