After further investigation of the i915 kernel driver and additional
testing, I found out the root cause is the VBT inside opregion. VBT
seems to contain configs like how the igd output (Intel call it DVO) is
mapped to physical ports. If VBT is not present, i915 driver is able to
mock one (in drivers/gpu/drm/i915/display/intel_bios.c:init_vbt_missing_defaults).
However, windows driver can't, reporting error 43 in device manager or
BSOD. Adding x-igd-opregion=on makes windows guest happy with the UPT
mode. My previous success on linux was just luck, my platform doesn't
has much difference with intel default configuration. OpRegion should
be a must for igd passthrough.

The PCI class code difference is only about whether the device is
chosen as the primary output in BIOS and is mapped to host VGA memory
range or not. The class code change is also observed on intel discrete
GPUs like A750. Both mode can have OpRegion present. Currently kernel
side only probes OpRegion when igd is in VGA class code. I submitted
a patch [1] to enable the probe for display controller mode, both
linux and windows guests can have output to monitor in this mode.  

Probably legacy mode means VGA support at first?
