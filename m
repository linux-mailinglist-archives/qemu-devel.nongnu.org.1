I think it's a bit rush to merge the vfio series in this release.  I'm not
sure it has enough time to be properly reviewed, reposted, retested, etc.

I've already started looking at it, and so far I think I have doubt not
only on agreement with Fabiano on the device_state thing which I prefer to
avoid, but also I'm thinking of any possible way to at least make the
worker threads generic too: a direct impact could be vDPA in the near
future if anyone cared, while I don't want modules to create threads
randomly during migration.

Meanwhile I'm also thinking whether that "the thread needs to dump all
data, and during iteration we can't do that" is the good reason to not
support that during iterations.

I didn't yet reply because I don't think I think all things through, but
I'll get there.

So I'm not saying that the design is problematic, but IMHO it's just not
mature enough to assume it will land in 9.1, considering it's still a large
one, and the first non-rfc version just posted two days ago.

Thanks,
