I think that's just documenting the current behavior, but the behavior
(not accepting a signed decimal number for a signed immediate) doesn't
appear to be justified, so I think my suggestion in [1] still stands.
That said, I don't really have much of a horse in this race so if
somebody comes along and closes that BZ with a simple justification of
"we, the people that work on this stuff, agreed we prefer the range
[0x0, 0xfffff]", then I won't argue.
