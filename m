Actually, some existing targets don't handle "negative" file sizes
properly. In particular, newlib generally treats the result as an int or
an off_t, which is a long (except on cygwin). Both of those types are
32 bits or smaller on (I)LP32. So if you return a 3 GiB size it will be
treated as -1 GiB. This will break lseek with SEEK_END, since newlib
uses the signed result of flen to recompute a new absolute offset.

IMO the spec is unclear, and this is reflected in the varying semantics
of differing implementations. I think returning any negative number
other than -1 is just inviting bugs.
