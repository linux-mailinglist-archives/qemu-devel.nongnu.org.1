IMHO in hw/net/vhost_net.c we should check the type of backend (e.g. 
vhost-vdpa) to decide whether to call 
vhost_ops->vhost_set_vring_enable() or not, instead of just checking 
whether the callback is implemented or not, because in the future we 
might have other backends (e.g. a native vdpa-blk driver) that might 
want that callback implemented.

Something like this (untested):

diff --git a/hw/net/vhost_net.c b/hw/net/vhost_net.c
index e8e1661646..1fea678e29 100644
--- a/hw/net/vhost_net.c
+++ b/hw/net/vhost_net.c
@@ -543,7 +543,8 @@ int vhost_set_vring_enable(NetClientState *nc, int enable)

      nc->vring_enable = enable;

-    if (vhost_ops && vhost_ops->vhost_set_vring_enable) {
+    if (nc->info->type != NET_CLIENT_DRIVER_VHOST_VDPA &&
+            vhost_ops && vhost_ops->vhost_set_vring_enable) {
          return vhost_ops->vhost_set_vring_enable(&net->dev, enable);
      }

WDYT?

Thanks,
Stefano
