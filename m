I think that would be similar to what's done here:
https://github.com/SolraBizna/qemu/commit/f551de525360a26df481c5b80876845c323d9303
Maybe add such additional draw routines with alpha and only set those in 
vga_draw_line_table when an alpha is set otherwise use the current ones. 
That should avoid changing current code in case when alpha is not 
used. Alternatively that qfb device could be merged and a PCI version 
added for mac99?
