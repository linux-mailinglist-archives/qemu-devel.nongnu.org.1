That's a different scenario.

That GPL clause applies to someone distributing the QEMU binaries. They
must make the corresponding source available in the "preferred form",
which would imply the form that the QEMU project released originally
in its source tarballs.

This doesn't say that QEMU maintainers have to choose a particular type
of source as the preferred one. We could easily choose the output of
"bison" as our preferred form of a given source file if we so wished, and
the GPL has no opinion on that matter. Just that downstream distributors
have to stick with the preferred source that QEMU originally chose.

This doc is about guiding our own contributors on what QEMU should pick
as the preferred form for source we release.

With regards,
Daniel
