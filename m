(do you mean "without a C equivalent" there?)

Hmm. The embedded-struct approach to devices is extremely common,
especially in more recent QEMU C code. Generally those users of
an embedded struct don't actually poke around inside the struct,
so we don't need to have the Rust code match the C layout, but
we do at least need the size to be no bigger than the C version.
(There are some exceptions for some devices, not including the PL011,
where people do poke around inside the struct of a device they've
created...)

There has been discussion that we ought to move (back!) to a
"users of the device just get a pointer to it and the struct
is opaque to them" design pattern -- command line generation
and wiring up of machines would also make that a more natural
approach -- but that's a long term process we'd need to plan
and go through.

I had some ideas a long time ago for making "code outside the
C device implementation touched a field in the device struct"
be a compile error using attribute("deprecated") hidden via macros,
so we could resurrect that as a way to confirm that nobody is
trying to do dubious things before we do a C-to-rust conversion
of a device model.

For the moment, I guess the expedient thing to do would be to add
an extra 16 bytes of padding to the C PL011State struct ?

thanks
