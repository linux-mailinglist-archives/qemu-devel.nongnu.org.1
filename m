I see.
Then maybe what we really miss are the special registers associated to 
PSTATE (CurrentEL, DAIF, NZCV, ...) which are defined architecturally.
When I tried to read EL for the first time using gdbstub, I was looking 
for CurrentEL, and finally found it accidently under CPSR.
Would that make more sense?

It seems we don't expose pstate at all now, and from your answer above, 
it would not make sense to expose it directly, as it's not formally 
defined. What is exposed by kgdb?
