You need to decide if it's more important to work with the community or
have your way every time. You cannot have both. You need to accept that
some things you think are good ideas have been rejected or you need to
fork off from U-Boot. Or you can ask the community to take over as the
project head. If the community wants you to run things, I will step
down and just be an individual contributor again. Five months of this
experiment shows me that it's not working at all and will only be a
bigger problem as time goes on.
