It is better to avoid manual resource deallocation in general because it 
is too error-prone.

I have an impression with QEMU code base that it is failing manual 
resource deallocation so frequently although such deallocation can be 
easily automated by binding resources to objects and free them when 
objects die by providing a function like Linux's devm_kmalloc(). 
Unfortunately I haven't found time to do that though.

So my opinion here is 1) we should automate resource deallocation as 
much as possible but 2) we shouldn't disturb code that performs manual 
resource management.

instance_finalize() is for manual resource management. It is better to 
have less code in instance_finalize() and fortunately MemoryRegion don't 
require any code in instance_finalize() in most cases. If 
instance_finalize() still insists to call object_unparent(), we 
shouldn't prevent that. (I changed my mind regarding this particular 
case of object_unparent() however as I describe below.)

I didn't know QOM deletes properties before instance_finalize().

I think it is a bad idea to delete properties before 
instance_finalize(). The intention is that to keep a usable parent 
during unparenting, but it is inevitable that an object is in a 
semi-finalized state during finalization. If the order of finalization 
matters, it should be explicitly described in instance_finalize(). 
Deleting properties before instance_finalize() prevents that.

That said, I think it is too late to revert that change. "make check" 
works as a preliminary check, but ultimately we need manual tree-wide 
review, which is too costly.

Going back to the original topic, I had the (incorrect) assumption that 
QOM deletes properties *after* instance_finalize(). Under such an 
assumption, it would be unsafe to remove a subregion from its container 
when a subregion is gone. As you said, we don't have to 
object_unparent(mr->container) and instead we can just call 
memory_region_del_subregion() instead to keep object_unparent() 
functional. However, strictly speaking, memory_region_del_subregion() is 
also a side effect and may affect operations with the container later. 
Such a side effect is better to be avoided whenever possible.

My point in this discussion is that the device has a control of its 
memory region even during finalization. We shouldn't call 
object_unparent(), memory_region_del_subregion(), or perform whatever 
operation on another memory region; otherwise the device may see an 
unexpected side effect.

Now, let's consider the correct assumption that QOM deletes properties 
*before* instance_finalize(). Under this assumption, the statement in 
docs/devel/memory.rst saying that calling object_unparent() in 
instance_finalize() is fine is wrong because the memory region is 
already finalized and we shouldn't call object_unparent() for a 
finalized object.

This also means a device does not have a control of its memory regions 
during finalization and the device will not see the side effect of 
calling memory_region_del_subregion(). However, if a device really needs 
to control the order of memory region finalization, it can still call 
object_ref() for memory regions to keep them alive until 
instance_finalize(). The effect of memory_region_del_subregion() will be 
  visible to the device if a device does such a trick. While it is very 
unlikely that any device does such a trick, it is still better to avoid 
having any assumption on devices.

With the proposed object_ref(mr->owner == subregion->owner ? 
OBJECT(subregion) : subregion->owner) call, we don't have to make any 
assumption on how finalization works, which is too complicated as this 
discussion shows. It certainly makes the use of two reference counters, 
but it does not deviate from the current policy on their usage and it is 
also trivial to adapt when the reference counter in memory region gets 
removed. Considering all above, I believe my patch is the most 
straightforward solution.
