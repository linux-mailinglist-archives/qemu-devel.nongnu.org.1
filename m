My current thought was still based on a new cap or anything the user would
need to specify first on both sides (but hopefully the last cap to set on
dest).

E.g. if with a new handshake cap we shouldn't set it on a exec: or file:
protocol migration, and it should just fail on qmp_migrate() telling that
the URI is not supported if the cap is set.  Return path is definitely
required here.

Yes, please see above.  I meant when we grow the handshake protocol we
should make sure we don't need anything new to be setup either on src/dst
of qemu.  It won't apply to before-handshake binaries.

Using a new channeltype would also work at least on src qemu, but I'm not
sure on how dest qemu would know that it needs a handshake in that case,
because it knows nothing until the connection is established.

Maybe we still need QEMU_VM_FILE_VERSION to be boosted at least in this
case, so dest can read this at the very beginning, old binaries will fail
immediately, new binaries will start to talk with v2 language.

I'm not sure I fully get it here.

IIUC tls handshake was mostly transparent to QEMU in this case while we're
relying on gnutls_handshake().  Here IIUC we need to design the roundtrip
messages to sync up two qemus well.

The round trip messages can contain a lot of things that can be useful to
us, besides knowing what features dest supports, what caps src use, we can
e.g. also provide a device tree dump from dest and try to match it on src,
failing the migration very early if we see any mismatch.  Right now we fail
too late, only until the device load (which is the last stage).

For channel orders, I'd expect the v2 protocol contains a phase to talk on
the channels and creation of named channels should be part of setup phase
before anything will happen next.

Thanks,
