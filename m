It is a UAF, but it is by design and not a bug.

The principle of the futex design is to use atomic memory operations to 
manage the state instead of using a system call, which is more expensive.

This principle motivates tolerating spurious wakeups. If wakeup system 
calls after free are forbidden, a thread will need to use a (expensive) 
system call to ensure the wake up actually happened before freeing. 
Instead, we can tolerate spurious wakeups without causing a buggy 
behavior by making the waiting thread perform (cheaper) atomic memory 
reads to verify the expected state.
