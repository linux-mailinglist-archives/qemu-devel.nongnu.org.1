The blocker does eventually show up to the user via
migration_is_blocked().

I get that there is an initial surprise to passing an Error around for
something that is not strictly an error, but IMO this is just a small
idiosyncrasy. For the lifecycle point, we could probably simplify what
we're doing in migration, I don't see why the Error ** needs to be
cleared in case the blocker cannot be installed.

I don't understand exactly why we need the Error **, it looks like we're
just storing that error twice, once via the device's migration_blocker
and another via the migration core's GSList
*migration_blockers.

The block layer doesn't have the use case of blocking the blocker like
migration does, but it still looks like the two are doing pretty much
the same, with the block "op" being analogous to the migration "mode".

I haven't found the need for those.
