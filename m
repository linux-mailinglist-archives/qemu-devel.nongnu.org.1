We do build 32-bit machines in ppc64-softmmu but leave out 64-bit from 
ppc-softmmu so it's only one way.

This is only because the default machine for ppc64-softmmu is different 
than for ppc-softmmu as the 64-bit machines don't exist in ppc-softmmu but 
ppc64-softmmu had different default machine before machines from 
qemu-system-ppc got included in qemu-system-ppc64 so it kept that. (Looks 
like the default used to be mac_newworld before commit 159f8286b760dea but 
wasn't changed to match but to something else.) The default machines are 
arbitrary, we could make "none" the default and always require users to 
supply -machine but that would break existing command lines so this wasn't 
done.

This is again leaving out 64-bit code from ppc-softmmu but as Thomas says 
32-bit machines are always included in qemu-softmmu-ppc64. I can't find 
the commit which changed this, previously we had these to be separate and 
since some types are different in ppc64-softmmu it wasn't clear if that 
could cause any problems for 32-bit CPUs and machines so ppc-softmmu was 
kept until that's cleaned up which never happened. There are also some 
pecularities in some machines like mac_newworld that behaves differently 
in qemu-system-ppc and qemu-system-ppc64 and the potentially lower 
performance of qemu-system-ppc64 in emulating 32-bit machines which is why 
we still have ppc-softmmu.
