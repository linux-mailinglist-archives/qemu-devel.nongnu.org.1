Apart from QEMU's test cases, I also use guest systems running 9p as root file 
system [1], run software compilations there among some things. That proofed to 
be quite a useful test environment to spot edge cases, concurrency and 
performance issues and such.

Greg was running some general purpose file system stress test suite in the 
past, but I currently can't recall what that was.

Almost. Maybe something like this to make it a bit more clear?

- Attribute names cannot begin with "user." or "system." on ZFS. However
  FreeBSD's extattr(2) system supports two dedicated namespaces for these
  two. So "user." or "system." prefixes are trimmed off from attribute
  names and instead EXTATTR_NAMESPACE_USER or EXTATTR_NAMESPACE_SYSTEM
  are picked and passed to extattr system calls instead accordingly.
