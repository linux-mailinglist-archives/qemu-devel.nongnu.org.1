In an ideal world, it should be eliminated completely.
The root problem is that it creates variation of symbols/types, which 
obviously can't be unified later when we mix targets together.
Of course, it's a paradigm shift, as QEMU traditionally was written with 
the "per target" approach in mind.

 From this perspective, the only place where it could eventually survive 
is within static functions or types private to a compilation unit, only 
if this compilation unit is private to a unique target architecture 
(TARGET_AARCH64 only for instance).

But in this case, it's much more easy to get rid of it and replace with 
it the real type directly. So I don't see any good reason to keep it 
anywhere.

Our solution here is to "widen" the concerned definitions, using vaddr 
or uint64_t for target_ulong (vaddr is possible only for addresses, 
because we removed 64 bits guests support on 32 bits hosts - I hope it 
won't bite us later).
For target_long, it's more tricky, as sign extension matters.

The problem is that it will necessarily break some stable interfaces, 
which were expecting a uint32_t before, but I think it's a necessary 
change to do at some point. But it can be done slowly and on a per 
target basis.

 From what I understood, the original meaning is that vaddr can contain 
a *guest* pointer, and not a *host* pointer. Since 64 bits targets have 
been disabled for 32 bits hosts, vaddr definition was changed to 
uintptr_t, where it was uint64_t before. [1]

The current series is mostly complete, and focused on low hanging 
fruits. The one remaining are a bit harder, and/or have external 
dependencies, but I didn't see anything impossible so far.

Luckily, we didn't have a lot of target_ulong in Arm related structs, so 
it's pretty easy to change. Some other architectures (especially the 
ones using them in cpu.h) will be harder.
