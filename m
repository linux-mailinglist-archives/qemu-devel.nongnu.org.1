Well migrate_cancel ought to be safer than yank. eg migrate_cancel (sh|c)ould
refuse to run if issued during post-copy phase. Or even in precopy, if
in the final vmstate copy & switchover phase we shouldn't need to cancel.
yank meanwhile will always run, no matter what, because by design, it has
no interaction with the migration code beyond knowing that a socket exists.

I don't  think we should combine them. They have alot of common, but there
are subtle differences that are relevant to the scenarios in which thye
are intended to be used.
