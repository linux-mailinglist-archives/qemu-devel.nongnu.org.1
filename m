How about doing both:
1. Making the "legacy" URL available immediately so that anything that
needs a permalink can use it (but they will explicitly specify the
word "legacy" in the URL, which is a hint that it's not the latest and
greatest release).
2. You set up a calendar reminder to send a patch updating QEMU's test
suite to the latest FreeBSD release every 12 months. A shell script
could perform the steps of updating the URL, committing the change,
and sending a patch email.

That way FreeBSD's latest release will be tested in a timely manner
and a snapshot of the QEMU test suite will still pass after 12 months.

What do you think?
