Hi all, sorry to have been away from this thread for a while, I was
trying to catch up on my reviews queue.

It seems the intention was to reuse monitor_fdset_cleanup() to do
cleanup when all monitors connections are closed:

efb87c1697 ("monitor: Clean up fd sets on monitor disconnect")
Author: Corey Bryant <coreyb@linux.vnet.ibm.com>
Date:   Tue Aug 14 16:43:48 2012 -0400

    monitor: Clean up fd sets on monitor disconnect
    
    Fd sets are shared by all monitor connections.  Fd sets are considered
    to be in use while at least one monitor is connected.  When the last
    monitor disconnects, all fds that are members of an fd set with no
    outstanding dup references are closed.  This prevents any fd leakage
    associated with a client disconnect prior to using a passed fd.

This could have been done differently at monitor_qmp_event():

    case CHR_EVENT_CLOSED:
        ...
        mon_refcount--;
        if (mon_refcount == 0) {
            monitor_fdsets_cleanup();
        }

But maybe there was a concern about making sure the empty fdsets (last
block in monitor_fdset_cleanup) were removed at every refcount decrement
and not only when mon_refcount == 0 for some reason.

I think that's the case that the patch in question was trying to
avoid. If the last monitor connects and disconnects while fds have not
been dup'ed yet, the mon_fdset->dup_fds list will be empty and what you
say will happen. There seems to be an assumption that after the guest
starts running all fds that need to be dup'ed will already have been
dup'ed.

So I think we cannot simply revert the patch as Daniel suggested,
because that might regress the original block layer use-case if a
monitor open->close causes the removal of all the yet undup'ed fds[1].

For the migration use-case, the dup() only happens after the migrate
command has been issued, so the runstate_is_running() check doesn't help
us. But it also doesn't hurt. However, we're still exposed to a monitor
disconnection removing the undup'ed fds. So AFAICS, we either stop
calling monitor_fdset_cleanup() at monitor close or declare that this
issue is unlikely to occur (because it is) and leave a comment in the
code.

===========
1- I ran a quick test:

connect()         // monitor opened: refcnt: 1

{"execute": "add-fd", "arguments": {"fdset-id": 1}}
{"return": {"fd": 9, "fdset-id": 1}}

{"execute": "add-fd", "arguments": {"fdset-id": 1}}
{"return": {"fd": 21, "fdset-id": 1}}

close()           // monitor closed: refcnt: 0

connect()         // monitor opened: refcnt: 1

{"execute": "migrate", "arguments": {"uri": "file:/dev/fdset/1,offset=4096"}}
{
    "error": {
        "class": "GenericError",
        "desc": "Outgoing migration needs two fds in the fdset, got 0"
    }
}

Prior to commit efb87c1697 ("monitor: Clean up fd sets on monitor
disconnect") we only called monitor_fdset_cleanup() from
qmp_remove_fd(), so we effectively always removed immediately after
setting ->removed = true. I don't see a reason to have the flag either.
