Sounds good, thanks!

It's a good compromise. I was thinking about doing something like this, 
but since the GPC is clearly in GranuleProtectionCheck the Arm pseudo 
code, I thought it was better to mimic it.
That said, I'm with your approach and will proceed with it.

How do we turn that into a concrete implementation?

Two ideas I can see:
- pass a callback taking attrs in param, and return the matching 
AddressSpace for it withing granule_protection_check. Clunky IMHO.
- Duplicate this attr variable out of function with .secure=true, and 
call arm_addressspace with it, and pass result to granule_protection_check.
