In theory there's no harm in allowing mass disabling of extensions but, given
it's a whole profile, we would end up disabling most/all CPU extensions and
the guest would do nothing.

There is a thread in the ML:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-riscv/CABJz62NyVNu4Z1qmCG7MyJkGG_9yWxjUFHHWjmoQEP6unRrHNA@mail.gmail.com/

Where we discussed the possibility of having a minimal CPU extension set. We didn't
reach a consensus because the definition of "minimal CPU extension set" vary between
OSes (Linux requires IMAFD, FreeBSD might require something differ).

Assuming we reach a consensus on what a minimal set is, we could allow disabling mass
extensions via probile but keeping this minimal set, for example. At very least we
shouldn't allow users to disable 'I' because that would kill the CPU, so RV64I is
the minimum set that I would assume for now.

Just read the discussion. I agree with restricting the command line flexibility
to make things more consistent, but IIRC libvirt (and others) uses a lot of
command line appending and restricting these use cases now will break stuff
up. I recall pc64 domains using <qemu:commandline> to add extra cpu/machine
flags to the domain back in the day. Surely we can claim (I guess) that command
line pass-through is unstable and users shouldn't expect extended support for
it, but we all know that users will be less than pleased when their domains
start breaking because QEMU restricted the command line.

As for the current RISC-V case, one thing we can do is to postpone feature group
processing to realize() time, since in that stage we're already done with the
command line processing. We can make a sanity check between the feature group
flags and error out if there's something off. That would make things a little
less fragile that what they are, albeit I'm sure that there will be some cases
that will be left uncovered.

There's no technical reason to not allow it. The reason it's forbid is to be
closer to what the real hardware would do. E.g. the real hardware doesn't allow
users to enable Vector if the hardware doesn't support it. Vendor CPUs also has
a privileged spec restriction as well, so if a CPU is running in an older spec
it can't enable extensions that were added later.

If vendor CPUs from x86 and others behave in a different way with feature enablement
I'd like to hear about it. I can say that what RISC-V is doing in this regard is
not that far from what PowerPC does.
