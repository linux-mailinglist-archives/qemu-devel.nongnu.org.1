It is noticeable for the guest, and the fallback is not effective with 
vhost. Enabling RSS by default will result in a similar problem although 
it is older than USO.

True. It only deals with the situation that "the host doesn't support 
the feature while the cmdline enabled it".

Well, there should be libvirt users who care performance and do not use 
migration so it's better for them if libvirt can use auto. But the use 
of "auto" should be mutually exclusive with migration of course.
