That is true, but we're already seeing alot of stuff that is directly
adjacent to QEMU that is written in Rust, with some overlaps amongst
contributors. Coconut SVSM, IGVM, Rust VMM, virtiofsd, libbkio, and
more besides.

So if we consider community as "open source virtualization devs" it
looks like there is a reasonable pool of talent with experience that
can cross-pollinate with QEMU.

I suggest we don't try to over-think this too much, as it'll become
a bit of a chicken and egg problem.

IMHO initial ideas for Rust usage will inevitable be fairly simple,
as that's part of the learning process for all of us, avoiding trying
to bite off too much too quickly. As a result, the initial work will
not look very compelling The more worthwhile and substantial things
will only arrive once use of Rust in QEMU has had time to marinate,
and at least some of them will be things we can't thing of ahead of
time.

   "if you build it, they will come"

Even if QEMU doesn't mandate Rust directly, Rust is already a part of
QEMU indirectly, so on the distro front the point of no return is
pretty much already here unless you want to cut out an increasing
number of interesting features.

eg we see ourselves integrating with libblkio, and igvm, both of which
we do via C shims around the Rust code. There are more of such things
to come - a Rust impl of the EDK vars storage is probable, there are
virtee crates for dealing with low level SEV pieces that have been
proposed before and seem interesting.

With regards,
Daniel
