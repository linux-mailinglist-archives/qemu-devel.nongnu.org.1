The spec is not relevant here as commit 9379ea9db3c0 ("virtio-net: Add 
queues before loading them") and this patch deal with migration.

QEMU promises that migration will not change behaviors visible to the 
guest and the number of virtqueues are visible to the guest. So these 
changes aim to prevent the number of virtqueues changes after migration.
