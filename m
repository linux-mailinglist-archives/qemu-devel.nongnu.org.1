It doesn't.  It can help getting code accepted and kept.

You didn't do anything wrong, Jackson!

In the long run, the cost of maintaining code commonly dwarfs the cost
of creating it.

That said, QEMU welcomes contributions, even if the author's goal is
just to learn or to have fun.  Learning and having fun matters!  It's up
to QEMU maintainers to reject patches that are likely to be more of a
burden than a benefit to QEMU.

Peter Maydell accepted yours in his role as ARM general architecture
maintainer.  If ARM maintainers come to the conclusion that an orphaned
MAX78000FTHR isn't worth keeping, they can deprecate and eventually
delete it.  I'm not going to interfere there :)
