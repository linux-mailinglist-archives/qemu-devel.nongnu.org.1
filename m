Please disconnect it from TDX. Even without TDX, it's reasonable enough 
to make the change to track HT in env->features[].

Why choose to ignore HT in the TDX check? HT isn't special. The problem 
is just HT is not tracked in env->features[], which is a incorrect design.

It assumes the env->features[] is finalized.

It's not TDX can't trust QEMU. It's all QEMU's business that QEMU to 
ensure what it is going to set for TD guest is consistent with what TD 
guest sees.

You are suggesting that when QEMU checks the features, it makes HT a 
special case that HT's value is finalized later than the check so please 
ignore HT.

What I want to achieve is to get rid of the special case, because HT 
isn't special. It can be tracked in env->features[] and finalized earlier.

The goal of this series is exactly generalization to make HT not special.

Imagine why Paolo suggested to post it separately? IIUC, because it's 
not TDX specific thing.
