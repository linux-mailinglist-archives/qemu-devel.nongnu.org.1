Yeah. we could just delete them. Just offering a section in case you don't
want to lose a mandate that every entity should be documented.

I don't have strong feelings beyond "I think we don't need to inline these,
but we should make it obvious when we do or do not."

If you want to just pull out these paragraphs to be comments before/after
the doc block or just delete them, I don't have strong feelings.

Sure, yeah. You're the maintainer, so your call.

(1) New comment section
(2) Pulled out as a non-doc-block comment
(3) Just deleted.

Inherited members: Injected *before* the member section *when already
present*. i.e., members are source order, ancestor-to-descendent.

Features are the same. The system does not care if they are duplicated.

The only ambiguity arises when the final descendent does not *have* member
or feature sections.

Current prototype's hack: if we leave the doc sections and members/features
remain undocumented, they are appended to the end of the block.

I do agree this isn't ideal. We had a call off-list earlier today where you
suggested the idea of a section or token that would mark the location for
such things to be inlined in the event that there was no obvious place
otherwise. I don't have a better idea; and it would make this action
explicit rather than implicit. It would only be needed in very few doc
blocks and it would be possible to write a very, very detailed error
message in the circumstances where this was missed.

i.e. a simple section that's just simply:

Inherited-Members: ...

or

Inherited-Features: ...

would do perfectly well.

Example error message: 'QAPI definition foo has inherited
<features/members> [from QAPI <meta-type> bar] but no local
<features/members> section in its documentation block. Please annotate
where they should be included in generated documentation by including the
line "Inherited-<Features/Members>: ..." in the doc block.'

(With a pointer to the source file and line where the doc block starts.)

If this line is erroneously *included* in a doc block that doesn't need it,
we can also emit a (fatal) warning urging its removal and an auditing of
the rendered HTML output.

That leaves other sections. We also spoke about the possibility of
eliminating "notes" and "examples" in exchange for explicit ReST/sphinx
syntax. I think that's probably a good idea overall, because it increases
flexibility in how we can annotate examples and remove more custom qapidoc
parsing code.

So, let's assume the only thing left would be "where do we inline inherited
paragraphs?"

How about this:

If we inherit from an object that *has* such paragraphs, then the
descendent needs to mark the spot for its inclusion.

Copying from the above ideas for members/features, how about:

Inherited-paragraphs: ...

The docgen uses this as the splice point. If the splice point is absent and
there are no paragraphs to splice in, there's no problem. If there are, we
can emit a very detailed warning that explains exactly what went wrong and
how to fix it. Similarly, if the splice point is indicated but absent, we
can warn and urge its removal alongside an audit of the generated
documentation.

This way, the feature is self-documenting and self-correcting. It will
catch regressions written before the feature existed and give guidance on
how to fix it. It will catch the large majority of rebase and refactoring
mistakes.

It adds a little complexity to the QAPIDoc parser, but not very much.

(And in fact, with the removal of Notes and Examples, it may indeed be
possible to refactor the parser to be drastically simpler. Alongside using
all_sections, once qapidoc.py is rewritten/replaced, even more drastic
simplifications are possible.)

Also discussed on call, but I'm leaving this alone for right now.

Current prototype: inherited "since" sections are ignored but emit a
non-fatal warning. We can audit these cases and decide if that's an
acceptable shortcoming while we work on something more robust, or if it
needs addressing before merge.

(Or if we just issue manual source corrections in the interim before your
proposed changes to generate such info are merged.)

OK.

So: I quite like the idea of inherited placeholders if and only if they are
required, and would like to proceed with prototyping this mechanism. Are
you OK with me proceeding to prototype this?

(It's okay to have reservations and we may still change our mind, but I
want a tentative ACK before I embark on this as it is categorically more
disruptive than any of the changes I've made thus far. i.e. does it
*conceptually* work for you?)

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Yes, this is a real problem.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The member documentation gets written in the context=
 of the type.=C2=A0 It<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; may make sense only in that context.=C2=A0 Inlining =
copies it into a<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; different context.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Features may need to combine.=C2=A0 Say a command&#3=
9;s arguments are a union<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; type, and several branches of the union both contain=

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; These branch types all document feature @deprecated.=
=C2=A0 Simply inlining<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; their feature documentation results in feature @depr=

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; several times.=C2=A0 Ugh.=C2=A0 Combining them would=
 be better.=C2=A0 But how?=C2=A0 Do we<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; need to rethink how we document features?<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; To be honest, I figured I&#39;d plow ahead and then find=
 the counter-examples<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; programmatically and decide what to do once I had my pil=
e of edge cases.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It might involve rewriting docs in some places, but I th=
ink the usability<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; win is completely worth the hassle.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s possible there might be some rework needed to m=
aximize cogency of the<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; generated docs, but I think prioritizing a user-facing r=
eference for QMP is<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the objectively correct end goal and I&#39;m more than h=
appy to work backwards<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; from that desired state.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not disputing the idea that documenting the arguments=
 right with the<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; command is good.=C2=A0 I&#39;m merely pointing out obstacles =
to pulling that off.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Adjusting existing documentation is only half the battle.=C2=
=A0 The other<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; half is making sure documentation stays adjusted.=C2=A0 We ma=
y have to come<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; up with new documentation rules, and ways to enforce them.<br=
>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; For the sake of argument, let&#39;s say we forbid everything excep=
t<br>
&gt;&gt; arg/features from definitions destined to be used as base/inherite=
d<br>
&gt;&gt; types. This would be very easy to enforce at the qapidoc level whe=
re<br>
&gt;&gt; the doc inlining is performed by yelping when the base type contai=
ns<br>
&gt;&gt; additional documentation sections.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Now, in the real world, maybe sometimes those sections are useful =
and<br>
&gt;&gt; we don&#39;t want to get rid of them, esp. because they may contai=
n useful<br>
&gt;&gt; documentation that we don&#39;t want to duplicate in the source fi=
les.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; My plan is to just forbid them at first and enumerate the cases wh=
ere<br>
&gt;&gt; they occur, then decide which ones are better off being moved<br>
&gt;&gt; elsewhere or explicitly tolerated. The generator&#39;s tolerance c=
an be<br>
&gt;&gt; adjusted accordingly and we can formulate a rule for exactly how d=
oc<br>
&gt;&gt; blocks are combined and merged. I think it won&#39;t be a problem =
to<br>
&gt;&gt; enforce it programmatically.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;ll get back to you on how often and precisely where these ca=
ses<br>
&gt;&gt; occur so you can take a look and see how you feel.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; For a warmup, let&#39;s look at every unique instance of non-empty<br>
&gt; paragraph text on an object that is used as a base anywhere:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Warning: AudiodevPerDirectionOptions - inlined paragraph<br>
&gt; Warning: BlockdevOptionsCurlBase - inlined paragraph<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; There&#39;s 22 instances.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Let&#39;s look at what they say:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; AudiodevPerDirectionOptions: &quot;General audio backend options that =
are<br>
&gt; used for both playback and recording.&quot;<br>
&gt; BlockdevOptionsCurlBase: &quot;Driver specific block device options sh=
ared<br>
&gt; by all protocols supported by the curl backend.&quot;<br>
&gt; BlockdevOptionsGenericCOWFormat: &quot;Driver specific block device op=
tions<br>
&gt; for image format that have no option besides their data source and an<=
br>
&gt; optional backing file.&quot;<br>
&gt; BlockdevOptionsGenericFormat: &quot;Driver specific block device optio=
ns<br>
&gt; for image format that have no option besides their data source.&quot;<=
br>
&gt; BlockExportOptionsNbdBase: &quot;An NBD block export (common options s=
hared<br>
&gt; between nbd-server-add and the NBD branch of block-export-add).&quot;<=
br>
&gt; BlockNodeInfo: &quot;Information about a QEMU image file&quot;<br>
&gt; ChardevCommon: &quot;Configuration shared across all chardev backends&=
quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; CpuInstanceProperties:<br>
&gt; &quot;List of properties to be used for hotplugging a CPU instance, it=
<br>
&gt; should be passed by management with device_add command when a CPU is<b=
r>
&gt; being hotplugged.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Which members are optional and which mandatory depends on the<br>
&gt; architecture and board.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; For s390x see :ref:`cpu-topology-s390x`.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The ids other than the node-id specify the position of the CPU<br>
&gt; within the CPU topology (as defined by the machine property &quot;smp&=
quot;,<br>
&gt; thus see also type @SMPConfiguration)&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; CryptodevBackendProperties: &quot;Properties for cryptodev-backend and=
<br>
&gt; cryptodev-backend-builtin objects.&quot;<br>
&gt; EventLoopBaseProperties: &quot;Common properties for event loops&quot;=
<br>
&gt; MemoryBackendProperties: &quot;Properties for objects of classes deriv=
ed<br>
&gt; from memory-backend.&quot;<br>
&gt; NetfilterProperties: &quot;Properties for objects of classes derived f=
rom netfilter.&quot;<br>
&gt; QCryptoBlockAmendOptionsLUKS: &quot;This struct defines the update<br>
&gt; parameters that activate/de-activate set of keyslots&quot;<br>
&gt; QCryptoBlockCreateOptionsLUKS: &quot;The options that apply to LUKS<br=

&gt; encryption format initialization&quot;<br>
&gt; QCryptoBlockInfoBase: &quot;The common information that applies to all=
 full<br>
&gt; disk encryption formats&quot;<br>
&gt; QCryptoBlockOptionsBase: &quot;The common options that apply to all fu=
ll<br>
&gt; disk encryption formats&quot;<br>
&gt; QCryptoBlockOptionsLUKS: &quot;The options that apply to LUKS encrypti=
on format&quot;<br>
&gt; RngProperties: &quot;Properties for objects of classes derived from rn=
g.&quot;<br>
&gt; SecretCommonProperties: &quot;Properties for objects of classes derive=
d<br>
&gt; from secret-common.&quot;<br>
&gt; SpiceBasicInfo: &quot;The basic information for SPICE network connecti=
on&quot;<br>
&gt; TlsCredsProperties: &quot;Properties for objects of classes derived fr=
om tls-creds.&quot;<br>
&gt; VncBasicInfo: &quot;The basic information for vnc network connection&q=
uot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ... Alright. So like 98% of the time, it&#39;s functionally useless<br=
>
&gt; information for the end-user. The only thing that looks mildly<br>
&gt; interesting is CpuInstanceProperties and *maybe*<br>
&gt; QCryptoBlockAmendOptionsLUKS.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I propose we add a new section to QAPI doc blocks that gets ignored<br=
>
&gt; from rendered documentation, like &quot;Comment:&quot; -- to keep any =
info that<br>
&gt; might be mildly relevant to a developer that explains the *factoring*<=
br>
&gt; of the object, but won&#39;t be exposed in user-facing documents.<br>
<br>
Two existing ways to add comments that don&#39;t go into generated<br>
documentation:<br>
<br>
1. Write a non-doc comment.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0##<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0# This is a doc comment.<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0##<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0#<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0# This isn&#39;t.<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0#<br>
<br>
2. TODO sections in a doc comment.<br>
<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; Warning: BackupCommon - inlined tag section Note<br>
&gt; Warning: CpuInstanceProperties - inlined, tag section Note<br>
&gt; Warning: MemoryBackendProperties - inlined tag section Note<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Not very many! Just three.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; BackupCommon:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Note: @on-source-error and @on-target-error only affect background<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0I/O.=C2=A0 If an error occurs during a guest write =
request, the<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0device&#39;s rerror/werror actions will be used.<br=

&gt;<br>
&gt; BackupCommon is used as a base for DriveBackup and BlockdevBackup. In<=
br>
&gt; this case, this note probably does belong on both. It should be<br>
&gt; inlined and included.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; CpuInstanceProperties:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Note: management should be prepared to pass through additional<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0properties with device_add.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; This is only used as a base with no other addon args for<br>
&gt; NumaCpuOptions, in turn only used for an argument. This is probably<br=

&gt; right to pass through, too. (Though I admit I don&#39;t really know wh=

In my experience, the people writing the doc comments rarely check how<br>
they come out in generated documentation.<br>
<br>
The closer the doc comments are to the generated documentation, the<br>
higher the chance it comes out as intended.<br>
<br>
The more complex the inlining gets, the higher the chance of mishaps.<br>
<br>
If cases of complex inlining are rare, we could sidestep complex<br>
inlining by inlining manually.<br>
<br>
If that&#39;s undesirable or impractical, we could require explicit<br>
instructions where the inlined material should go.<br>
