Can you point me to the spot?

You wrote "you'll get a conflict".  I assume this manifests as failure
of a QMP command (let's ignore CLI to keep things simple here).

Do we think ordinary users running into that failure can figure out they
can avoid it by setting @iothreads?

What's that failure's error message?

Up to you.  I lack context to judge.

Making yourself or your fellow experts understand how this works is not
the same as making users understand how to use it.  Making me understand
is not the same either, but it might be closer.

If this isn't useful to you, let me know, and I'll shut up :)
