Actually, now that completely unproblematic part is giving me trouble.  
I wanted to just put a graph lock into blk_get_aio_context() (making it 
a coroutine with a wrapper), but callers of blk_get_aio_context() 
generally assume the context is going to stay the BB’s context for as 
long as their AioContext * variable is in scope.  I was tempted to think 
callers know what happens to the BB they pass to blk_get_aio_context(), 
and it won’t change contexts so easily, but then I remembered this is 
exactly what happens in this case; we run 
scsi_device_for_each_req_async_bh() in one thread (which calls 
blk_get_aio_context()), and in the other, we change the BB’s context.

It seems like there are very few blk_* functions right now that require 
taking a graph lock around it, so I’m hesitant to go that route.  But if 
we’re protecting a BB’s context via the graph write lock, I can’t think 
of a way around having to take a read lock whenever reading a BB’s 
context, and holding it for as long as we assume that context to remain 
the BB’s context.  It’s also hard to figure out how long that is, case 
by case; for example, dma_blk_read() schedules an AIO function in the BB 
context; but we probably don’t care that this context remains the BB’s 
context until the request is done.  In the case of 
scsi_device_for_each_req_async_bh(), we already take care to re-schedule 
it when it turns out the context is outdated, so it does seem quite 
important here, and we probably want to keep the lock until after the 
QTAILQ_FOREACH_SAFE() loop.

On a tangent, this TOCTTOU problem makes me wary of other blk_* 
functions that query information.  For example, fuse_read() (in 
block/export/fuse.c) truncates requests to the BB length.  But what if 
the BB length changes concurrently between blk_getlength() and 
blk_pread()?  While we can justify using the graph lock for a BB’s 
AioContext, we can’t use it for other metadata like its length.
