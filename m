I'd even say MAINTAINERS file is, in many cases, cosmetic..

It definitely is helpful for people to do lookups or scripts to fetch
information, but IMHO we need more than one single entry, and in some sense
that entry is less important than the activities.

We need someone to be first familiar with a piece of code, spend time on
it, actively reply to the relevant queries upstream, proper testing /
gating to make sure the feature is usable as stated - either fully
maintained or odd fixes or others, and more.

I used to request Lukas help reviewing the loadvm threadify series [1,2]
which definitely touches COLO, I didn't really get a respond.  That's also
a sign I don't feel like Lucas cares enough about COLO, after I explicitly
pointing out something might be changing and might be risky.

It's like Hailiang is also in the MAINTAINERS file but Hailiang is
unfortunately not active anymore recently over the years.

Frankly, it was Zhijian and Chen that were always helping from that regard.
I would rather think anyone of both would be more suitable at least from
all the discussions I had with COLO, but this is a promise I can't do.  I
also still want to remove it as I proposed, in case it releases everyone.

So an update in the file isn't even enough if we accept it.  We need
activity corresponding to the file change.  That's also why I still think
we should remove COLO regardless if 11.0 doesn't improve in this condition,
as I stated in the other email.
