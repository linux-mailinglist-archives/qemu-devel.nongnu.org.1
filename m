I think it is best to initialize in kvm_msr_energy_thread_init(),
prior to thread creation, as that avoids some complexity cleaning
up and reporting errors.

Opps, yes, 'maxpkgs' is iterating over CPU /socket/ ID numbers

The point still stands though. NUMA node ID numbers are not
guaranteed to be the same as socket ID numbers. Very often
then will be the same (which makes it annoying to test as it
is easy to not realize the difference), but we can't rely on
that.

maxpkgs comes from vmsr_get_max_physical_package() which you're
reading from sysfs, rather than libnuma.

I'm not actually convinced we need to use libnuma at all. IIUC, you're
just trying to track all CPUs within the same physical socket (package).
I don't think we need to care about NUMA nodes to do that tracking.

Historically you could have multiple sockets in the same NUMA node
ie a m:1 mapping.

These days with AMD sockets, you can have 1 socket compromising
many NUMA nodes, as individual dies within a socket are each their
own NUMA node. So a 1:m mapping

On Intel I think it is still typical to have 1 socket per numa
node, but again I don't think we can rely on that 1:1 mapping.

Fortunately I don't think it matters, since it looks like you
don't really need to track NUMA nodes, only sockets (phnysical
package IDs)

With regards,
Daniel
