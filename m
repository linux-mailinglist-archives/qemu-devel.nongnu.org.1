I don't wish to derail this thread, but we've been dancing around the
question of how to best fix the target for some time.  I think we should
talk about it for real.

Mind, this is not an objection to your larger "single binary" idea.  It
could be only if it was an intractable problem, but I don't think it is.

You want the single binary you're trying to create to be a drop-in
replacement for per-target binaries.

"Drop-in replacement" means existing usage continues to work.
Additional interfaces are not a problem.

To achieve "drop-in replacement", the target needs to be fixed
automatically, and before the management application can further
interact with it.

If I understand you correctly, you're proposing to use argv[0] for that,
roughly like this: assume it's qemu-system-<target>, extract <target>
first thing in main(), done.

What if it's not named that way?  If I understand you correctly, you're
proposing to fall back to a compiled-in default target.

I don't think this is going to fly.

Developers rename the binary all the time, and expect this not to change
behavior.  For instance, I routinely rename qemu-FOO to qemu-FOO.old or
qemu-FOO.COMMIT-HASH to let me compare behavior easily.

We could relax the assumption to support such renames.  Developers then
need to be aware of what renames are supported.  Meh.

The more we relax the pattern, the likelier surprising behavior becomes.

We could mitigate surprises by eliminating the built-in default target.

Users invoke their binaries with their own names, too.  If Joe R. User
finds qemu-system-<joe's-fav-target> too much to type, and creates a
symlink named q to it, more power to him!

Distributions have packaged renamed binaries.  qemu-kvm has been used
quite widely.

In neither of these cases, relaxing the pattern helps.

The least bad solution I can see so far is a new option -target.

Instead of turning the target-specific binaries into links to / copies
of the single binary, they become wrappers that pass -target as the
first option.  We need to make sure this option is honored in time then,
which should be easy enough.

If you invoke the single binary directly, you need to pass -target
yourself.  If you don't to pass it, or pass it late in the command line,
you open up a window for interaction with indeterminate target.
Target-specific interfaces could exhibit different behavior then, even
fail.  That's fine under "additional interfaces are not a problem".

Thoughts?
