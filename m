Some (probably not all) offloads are implemented in hw/net/net_tx_pkt.c. 
They are not wired up to behave as a fallback when tuntap's vhost is 
enabled as the in-QEMU RSS is not. In either case, we need to pay some 
effort to wiring things.

I'm not sure it is worthwhile. I think there is a high chance that 
selectively disabling vhost and keeping RSS enabled with fallback will 
result in worse performance than keeping vhost enabled and disabling 
RSS. Such a fallback can still function as an emergency escape hatch, 
but it is also incomplete as we don't have fallbacks for other features. 
I would rather make any features missing in the vhost backend fail to 
keep things consistent.
