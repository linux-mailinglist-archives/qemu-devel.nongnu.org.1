Hi!

It looks like this patchset has a few bugfixes which aren't specific to
vmapple.  These are already mentioned in this patchset description,
namely:

  hw/usb/hcd-xhci-pci: Use modulo to select MSI vector as per spec
  hw/usb/hcd-xhci-pci: Use event ring 0 if mapping unsupported

Should these be picked up for qemu-stable?

Thanks,

>   * 14 patches now, as patch 8 has already been pulled. (Thanks Philippe!)
>   * Fixed a bunch of conflicts with upstream code motion:
>      - DEFINE_PROP_END_OF_LIST removal (4/14 - apple-gfx mode list, 7/14 -
>        pvpanic-mmio, 10/14 - bdif, 11/14 - cfg device, and
>        12/14 - vmapple-virtio-blk)
>      - sysemu->system move/rename: (1/14 - ui/qemu-main, 2/14 - apple-gfx,
>        9/14 - aes, 10/14 - bdif, 14/14 - vmapple machine type)
>   * 14/14 (vmapple machine type):
>      - Moved compatibility setting for removing legacy mode from virtio-pci
>        to proper global property table rather than (ab)using sugar property.
>      - Removed a few superfluous #includes during sysemu rename cleanup.
>      - Removed machine type versioning as it's not necessary (yet?)
>      - Made memory map array const
> 
> XHCI RFC -> v1:
> 
>   * Gated conditional interrupter mapping support behind a property, enabled
>     that property in the VMApple machine type.
>   * Added patch to fix the MSI vector assertion failure.
>   * Moved msi and msix properties from NEC XHCI controller to generic xhci-pci
>     superclass as that also seems useful.
>   * Broke the workaround up into 2 patches, one for mapping disabling required
>     by the standard, and one for the conditional disabling workaround.
> 
> XHCI v1 -> v2:
> 
>   * 1/6: Switch to modulo arithmetic for MSI vector number, as per spec.
>   * 6/6: Set the "conditional-intr-mapping" property via compat_props.
>   * Commit message tweaks
> 
> XHCI v2 -> v3:
> 
>   * 2/6: In line with recent upstream changes, the property table is now
>     const and no longer carries an end-of-list marker.
>   * The indentation fix (previously 5/6) has already been merged, so is no
>     longer included.
>   * Added patch fixing up logging of certain unhandled MMIO cases. (4/6)
>   * 6/6: Moved the compat global property table into vmapple patch set -v16;
>     we now just add the conditional-intr-mapping property to it in this
>     patch. We also set the property on any device implementing the abstract
>     TYPE_XHCI_PCI rather than only the TYPE_QEMU_XHCI device specifically.
> 
> v16 -> v17
> 
>   * Rebased on latest upstream (with minor conflict fixes)
>   * apple-gfx, GPEX, and ui/cocoa patches dropped as they have been merged.
>   * Unmerged patches from xhci series v3 combined into this series.
>   * vmapple machine type: Explicitly depend on software GICv3.
>   * vmapple machine type: Enable the new XHCI PCI conditional-intr-mapping
>     property via the machine type's global compat property table.
>   * Integrated Philippe's patch on renaming the GICv3's confusing config name,
>     and removing its TCG dependency. (It's needed with HVF too.)
>   * vmapple machine type: Dropped Tested-by tag because of above changes
