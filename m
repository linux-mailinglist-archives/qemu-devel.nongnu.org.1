This is a respin of Daniel's series that re-enables the meson test
runner timeouts. To make sure that we do not get into trouble on
older systems, I ran all the tests with "make check SPEED=slow -j32"
on my laptop that has only 16 SMT threads, so each test was running
quite a bit slower than with a normal "-j$(nproc)" run. I think
that these timeouts should now work in most cases - if not, we still
can adjust them easily later.

Daniel's original patch series description follows:

---------------------------- 8< -------------------------------------

Perhaps the most painful of all the GitLab CI failures we see are
the enforced job timeouts:

   "ERROR: Job failed: execution took longer than 1h15m0s seconds"

   https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/jobs/4387047648

when that hits the CI log shows what has *already* run, but figuring
out what was currently running (or rather stuck) is an horrendously
difficult.

The initial meson port disabled the meson test timeouts, in order to
limit the scope for introducing side effects from the port that would
complicate adoption.

Now that the meson port is basically finished we can take advantage of
more of its improved features. It has the ability to set timeouts for
test programs, defaulting to 30 seconds, but overridable per test. This
is further helped by fact that we changed the iotests integration so
that each iotests was a distinct meson test, instead of having one
single giant (slow) test.

We already set overrides for a bunch of tests, but they've not been
kept up2date since we had timeouts disabled. So this series first
updates the timeout overrides such that all tests pass when run in
my test gitlab CI pipeline. Then it enables use of meson timeouts.

We might still hit timeouts due to non-deterministic performance of
gitlab CI runners. So we'll probably have to increase a few more
timeouts in the short term. Fortunately this is going to be massively
easier to diagnose. For example this job during my testing:

   https://gitlab.com/berrange/qemu/-/jobs/4392029495

we can immediately see  the problem tests

Summary of Failures:
  6/252 qemu:qtest+qtest-i386 / qtest-i386/bios-tables-test                TIMEOUT        120.02s   killed by signal 15 SIGTERM
  7/252 qemu:qtest+qtest-aarch64 / qtest-aarch64/bios-tables-test          TIMEOUT        120.03s   killed by signal 15 SIGTERM
 64/252 qemu:qtest+qtest-aarch64 / qtest-aarch64/qom-test                  TIMEOUT        300.03s   killed by signal 15 SIGTERM

The full meson testlog.txt will show each individual TAP log output,
so we can then see exactly which test case we got stuck on.
