I originally implemented a completely separate 'tags' concept in the
QAPI parser, before deciding I was just re-inventing 'features' for
no obvious benefit.

The other nice thing about using features is that these are exposed
in the schema and docs. With the 'fsfreeze' restriction in code,
there's no formal docs of what commands are allowed when frozen, and
this is also not exposed in QAPI schema to apps. Using 'features'
we get all that as standard.

With regards,
Daniel
