Yeah, actually this is a pre-existing bug I should fix in a
preceeding patch.  isa_ne2000_init can fail today, but we
don't check the return value, and unconditionally do
"nb_ne2k++". So nb_ne2k is wrong if isa_ne2000_init ever
fails. Not sure if this has any bad functional effect,
but conceptually it is clearly a bug.

Yeah, I had the same horrified realization that we'd made machine ABI
vary based on installed pkgs :-( Not sure how to get us out of that
mess easily.

Agreed, we definitely need to distinguish "module not installed",
from all other types of failure to load a module.

I can have another think about changing it. Mostly I was just working
backwards when creating this, by deleting the methods I wanted to
remove and the patching up the build failures, so there wasn't much
thought put into the split of this one.

With regards,
