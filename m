I think the current convention was discussed around here:
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/33641fa3-f617-3151-e7ca-becaf06e2641@ilande.co.uk/
but looks like it did not make it into docs/devel/qom.rst to make it 
clear for all.

If your search found nothing on lists.gnu.org/archive maybe it has 
something to do with this message printed there:

References: [ (The index is locked for maintenance) ]

I don't know what that means but all searches seem to return the same 
currently.
