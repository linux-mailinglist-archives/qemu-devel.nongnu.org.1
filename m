Children properties are removed, and thus their reference is dropped,
before instance_finalize() is called (see object_finalize() in
qom/object.c). This is not valid in Rust, you need to keep the object
alive until the last line of Rust code has run - which is after
Drop::drop() has run.

In C, having a ref count of 2 is usually a latent memory leak (because
most of the time there's not going to be an object_unref() in the
instance_finalize() method). In this case the leak is latent, because
TYPE_EXYNOS4210_SOC is not hot-unpluggable and thus will never really
go away once realized.

In Rust, this class of leaks simply does not exist with the right API.
ObjectMethods::property_add_child() could either:

- take an Owned<T> and consume it, thus always giving a ref count of 1
on exit. If you want to keep the object you would have to clone it.

- take "&'owner self, &'child T where 'owner: 'child", then you can
pass an embedded object like object_initialize_child().

In the latter case however you *still* need to keep the reference
count elevated until Drop runs. That is, unlike C, Rust code will
always have a ref count of 2 for children. For this reason, instead of
having a "T" in the struct you would have another wrapper---something
like Child<'owner, T>. This wrapper cannot be cloned but it does an
unref when dropped.

My expectation is that property_add_child() will be used exclusivel
for the first case, i.e. it will take an Owned<T>. If you want to
create a child property from an embedded object, something like
object_initialize_child() can be used once pinned-init is used to
rewrite how instance_init is used. It will look something like

pin_init! {
  &this in MyClass {
    ...,
    iomem <- MemoryRegion::init_io(
            this,
            &MY_MR_OPS,
            "memory-region-name",
            0x1000,
    ),
    child_obj <- ChildClass::init().to_child(this, "prop-name")
  }
}

where to_child() wraps an "impl PinInit<T>" and turns it into an "impl
PinInit<Child<'a, T>>". Or something like that. :)

Yes, you're right.

I am not sure if you meant Child<> as the QOM concept, or as a Rust
struct. If the latter, you're really really right.
