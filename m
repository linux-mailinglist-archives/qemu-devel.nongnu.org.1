After some more testing, I think the issue is indeed in the current
implementation of packed vq in QEMU. The kernel does not crash when
using packed vqs with x-svq=false. I have an idea that might help
find the issue. It involves debugging the linux kernel. I'll try this
out and will let you know how it goes.
