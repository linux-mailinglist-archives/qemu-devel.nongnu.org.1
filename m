Even if we remove -m, it will still be passed in when people run make
SPEED=slow check and people who know about glib/qtests will continue to
try to use it.

Ignoring -m and FLAKY will create a diversion from the rest of qtest and
QEMU tests in general. I think the best approach is to drop levels 3 and
4 from this proposal and just ignore those options altogether.

If we're going to have a single binary as you suggest, then there's no
harm still using -m slow and FLAKY as usual. We call level 1: "smoke
tests", level 2: "full set" and we put in some code to prevent
registering a smoke test as slow or flaky and that's it.

... and of course, if there's only two levels, then we only need a
boolean flag: --full

IOW, I still don't think slow and flaky have anything to do with what
we're trying to do here. I do appreciate that a single binary is better
than two.

User permissions, containers, configuration changes in between build
time and runtime, etc.

Also, it's quite convenient to be able to pass any QEMU binary to any
version of the tests, I do that with downstream builds sometimes.

I dislike this, however I'm thinking what's the worse that could happen
if there's a mismatch between configure and runtime? We'd just run a
different set of tests.

Can we make it:

meson.build:
  # If there's KVM support, run the full set of migration tests as KVM
  # hosts tend to use more migration features than just save/restore.
  if fs.exists('/dev/kvm')
    migration_test_args = "--full"
  endif

cmdline invocations:
  ./migration-test                 # runs smoke, i.e. level 1
  ./migration-test -m slow         # runs smoke only, no slow tests in the smoke set
  FLAKY=1 ./migration-test         # runs smoke only, no flaky tests in the smoke set

  ./migration-test --full          # runs full set, i.e. level 2
  ./migration-test --full -m slow  # runs full set + slow tests
  FLAKY=1 ./migration-test --full  # runs full set + flaky tests

I made the first one like that so the compat tests in CI now run less
tests. We don't need full set during compat because that job is about
catching changes in device code. It would also make the argument easier
to enable the compat job for all migration-test-supported archs.

I meant we shouldn't break the command line invocation:

./tests/qtest/migration-test -p <test_name>

As in, we cannot change the test name or add mandatory flags. Otherwise
we have a discrepancy betweem what the CI job is calling vs. what the
build actually provides. We run the tests from the previous build, but
the CI job is current.

Another point that is more of an annoyance is that the migration-test
invocation not being stable affectes debug, bisect, etc. When debugging
the recent multifd regression I already had to keep changing from
/multifd/tcp/... to /multifd/tcp/uri/... when changing QEMU versions.
