When a user chooses to force shutdown QEMU by pressing ^C or sending a
SIGINT otherwise, we want to shutdown as soon as possible, and entering
a blocking read which happens in the main thread seems like the opposite
of that.

This may seem like a rare case, but it is actually not when using
vhost-user devices, which usually have the control plane working via
UNIX sockets.

The way the code is currently written, all vhost-user devices are
serviced in the main thread and thus block each other, as well as other
things that happen in the QEMU's main thread, including QMP, and even
network devices that are not vhost-net.

In case the vhost-user backend servicing a device decides to hang for
whatever reason, any control plane request in QEMU will also hang the
main loop until the backend either dies or ends up replying.

Ideally the vhost-user handling code should be rewritten to work
asynchronously, or to support io-threads or similar, but that seems like
a giant undertaking and we would like to at least be able to make QEMU
shutdown no matter if a vhost-user backend is currently able to service
the control plane or not.

Luckily for us, SIGINT or similar causes the kernel to cancel (almost)
all blocking syscalls with EINTR, which we can utilize to check whether
a shutdown was requested while we were blocked in the syscall, which is
what this commit does. The check is performed even on the first attempt,
not only retries after EINTR. This is intentional to avoid race
conditions where QEMU may decide to perform a control plane request
before the shutdown event is checked for thus forcing the user to send
SIGINT at least 2 times.
