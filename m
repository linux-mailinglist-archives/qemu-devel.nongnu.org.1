In fact, the last commit describes the meaning of this series best. Perhaps
it should have been moved to the cover letter:
Often, many teams have their own "machines" inherited from "upstream" to
manage default values of devices. This is done because of the limitations
imposed by the compatibility requirements or the desire to help their
customers better configure their devices. And since machine type has
a hard-to-read structure, it is very easy to make a mistake when 
transferring
default values from one machine to another. For example, when some property
is set for the entire abstract class x86_64-cpu (which will be applied 
to all
models), and then rolled back for a specific model. The situation is about
the same with changing the default values of devices: if the value changes
in the description of the device itself, then you need to make sure that
nothing changes when using the current machine.
Therefore, there was a desire to make a dev tool that will help quickly 
expand
the definition of a machine or compare several machines from different 
binary
files. It can be used when rebasing to a new version of qemu and/or for
automatic tests.

Yeah this seems like migration relevant.. however now I'm slightly confused
on when this script should be useful.

According to:

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20240222153912.646053-5-davydov-max@yandex-team.ru/">https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20240222153912.646053-5-davydov-max@yandex-team.ru/</a>

        This script runs QEMU to obtain compat_props of machines and
        default values of different types of drivers to produce comparison
        table. This table can be used to compare machine types to choose
        the most suitable machine or compare binaries to be sure that
        migration to the newer version will save all device
        properties. Also the json or csv format of this table can be used
        to check does a new machine affect the previous ones by comparing
        tables with and without the new machine.

In regards to "choose the most suitable machine": why do you need to choose
a machine?

If it's pretty standalone setup, shouldn't we always try to use the latest
machine type if possible (as normally compat props are only used to keep
compatible with old machine types, and the default should always be
preferred). If it's a cluster setup, IMHO it should depend on the oldest
QEMU version that plans to be supported.  I don't see how such comparison
helps yet in either of the cases..

In regards to "compare binaries to be sure that migration to the newer
version will save all device properties": do we even support migrating
_between_ machine types??

Sololy relying on compat properties to detect device compatibility is also
not reliable.  For example, see VMStateField.field_exists() or similarly,
VMStateDescription.needed(), which are hooks that device can provide to
dynamically decide what device state to be saved/loaded.  Such things are
not reflected in compat properties, so even if compat properties of all
devices are the same between two machine types, it may not mean that the
migration stream will always be compatible.
