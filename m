This patch seems to work, in that it fixes the memory-region
related leaks I previously was seeing. Review comments below
(which are only about the commit message and docs).

I also can't remember the details of the previous discussions about
these patches, so I'm reviewing the one below essentially from
scratch. Apologies in advance if we end up going back around
a conversation loop that we've already had...

I think that it's not really right to cast this as "some devices
don't do this right". The pattern of "a device has a container MR C
and some other MRs A, B... which it puts into C" is a legitimate one.
If you do this then (with the current code in QEMU) there is *no*
place where a device emulation can do a manual "remove A, B.. from
the container C so the refcounts go down": the place where devices
undo what they did in instance_init is instance_deinit, but we
will never call instance_deinit because the refcount of the owning
device never goes to 0.

Further, even if we had some place where devices could somehow
undo the "put A, B... in the container so the refcounts go down
correctly", it is better API design to have the memory.c code
automatically handle this situation. "This just works" is more
reliable than "this works if you do cleanup step X", because it's
impossible to have the bug where you forget to write the code to
do the cleanup step.

I think we should not say "we suggest you always cleanly detach the MRs":
instead we should say "you can rely on this happening, so you don't
need to write manual code to do it".

The actual code changes look OK to me.

thanks
