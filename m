i386 has the default cache topology model: l1 per core/l2 per core/l3
per die.

Cache topology affects scheduler performance, e.g., kernel's cluster
scheduling.

Of course I can hardcode some cache topology model in the specific cpu
model that corresponds to the actual hardware, but for -cpu host/max,
the default i386 cache topology model has no flexibility, and the
host-cpu-cache option doesn't have enough fine-grained control over the
cache topology.

So I want to provide a way to allow user create more fleasible cache
topology. Just like cpu topology.

> Why does that use case make no sense without SMP?

As the example I mentioned, for Intel hyrbid architecture, P cores has
l2 per core and E cores has l2 per module. Then either setting the l2
topology level as core nor module, can emulate the real case.

Even considering the more extreme case of Intel 14th MTL CPU, where
some E cores have L3 and some don't even have L3. As well as the last
time you and Daniel mentioned that in the future we could consider
covering more cache properties such as cache size. But the l3 size can
be different in the same system, like AMD's x3D technology. So
generally configuring properties for @name in a list can't take into
account the differences of heterogeneous caches with the same @name.

Hope my poor english explains the problem well. :-)

> Can the same @name occur multiple times?  Documentation doesn't tell.

Yes, this means the later one will override the previous one with the same
name.

Yes, we should check in smp/machine code and ban l1 and l1i/l1d at the
same time. This check I suppose is easy to add.

> May @topo be "invalid"?  Documentation doesn't tell.  If yes, what does

Yes, just follow the intel's spec, invalid means the current topology
information is invalid, which is used to encode x86 CPUIDs. So when I
move this level to qapi, I just keeped this. Otherwise, I need to
re-implement the i386 specific invalid level.

I think the SmpCacheName is ok, since there's no other better names.

Ah, I also considerred this. I didn't use "type" because people usually
uses cache type to indicate INSTRUCTION/DATA/UNIFIED and cache level to
indicate LEVEL 1/LEVEL 2/LEVEL 3. The enumeration here is a combination of
type+level. So I think it's better to avoid the type term.

I have the thoughts and questions here:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20240704031603.1744546-1-zhao1.liu@intel.com/T/#m8adba8ba14ebac0c9935fbf45983cc71e53ccf45

We could discuss this issue in that thread :-).
