Hi, some description would be good of how you caught these
(I'm guessing a close read).

Whilst checking this I did notice there are some errors in
the example bus numbering but that's a separate issue.

This one is wrong.  CFMW1 interleaves across both host bridges so we need
a device below HB0 and one below HB1, so CXL type3 2 is a possible choice
(could be CXL type3 3 as well, but that doesn't matter.)

Good.
