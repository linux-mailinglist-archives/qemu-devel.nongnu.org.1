This adds mandatory declaration of identifiers used in conditions to the
QAPI schema language.

The declarations can then serve as hooks for doc comments.  These should
ineed result in a more complete and useful generated manual.  John,
thoughts?

The condition documentation would supplement / partially duplicate the
configure flag documentation in meson_options.txt.

We'd need to tie the two together to make the code work (see your next
paragraph).  We should also tie their documentation together somehow.
Feels like a solvable problem.

I think the conditions that are evaluated at build time in handwritten C
code (with #if) should also be evaluated at build time in generated C
code.

Certain conditions are evaluated at build time in target-specific code,
and at runtime in target-independent code.  Again, I think handwritten
and generated code should work the same way.

Thus, to eliminate target-specific QAPI-generated code, we either
evaluate them at runtime, or simply eliminate them.  Elsewhere, we've
come to the conclusion (I think) that the latter should do at least for
now, likely forever, so we should try that first.

Fortunately, this is merely a matter of filling a gap we left, not a
matter of replacing a fundamentally flawed design.

I don't see much of a difference, to be honest.

Both kinds of conditionals have the exact same argument structure:
expression tree where the leaves are identifiers.

The meaning of these identifiers is not documented in the QAPI schema
now, and barely documented in the code.

This defect could be remedied the exact same way whether the identifiers
are preprocessor macros or function names.

I actually find another argument of yours (not repeated above) more
compelling: that certain aspects of the external interface should not
vary at runtime.
