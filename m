I think you want to run under icount and you will need to modify the
trigger plugin. Under icount we run each vCPU in turn, so if the plugin
pauses the vCPU will de-facto be paused.

You would have to implement some sort of control interface in the
plugin. Or you could add an API to trigger the gdbstub. I think I had
that on a patch series at one point.
