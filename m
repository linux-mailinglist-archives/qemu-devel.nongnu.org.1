If we want to drop some backends that's fine, as IMHO we've got
needlessly many there.

Note, I would describe our format strings as printf-like/light. We certainly
do NOT allow the full range of C library formats, because we need to be able
to pass the format strings to systemtap, which is likewise merely printf-like.

Do don't really do any significant upfront validation on the format specifiers
beyond checking for invalid %m and newlines. In practical terms though the
only things we can use are

  %x %u %d %s %p

with optional 'l', 'll' or 'z' modifiers and digit precision for the int
formats. Anything beyond that will likely fail with systemtap. We ought
to move validation for this to the parsing phase to strongly enforce this
limited syntax.

IOW, in any tracetool format generator for rust, we could fairly easily
translate the format string from printf-like to rust style.

With regards,
Daniel
