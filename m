There's still another one here. You can say "in one attempt" or "at once"

Maybe adding (e.g. virtio-gpu) below display device would make it clearer. 
Also under compositor there's "guest_y dy" where the dy seems to be left 
there by mistake from some editing or I don't get this sentence. (Did 
checkpatch.pl complain about too long lines? Maybe you could shorten the 
arrows a bit and wrap the text under QEMU in two lines to try to fit in 80 
chars.)

Sorry that I can only comment on the comments and not the actual change 
but I've cc'd Howard who I think saw this issue before so may be able to 
give it a test.

Looking at this calculation I don't quite get what's intended here and I 
think this could be simplified. Originally in 47c03744b37 it seems the 
qemu_input_queue_rel() was called with the modified value of x and y but 
then afbc0dd6498 have introduced dx, dy. After that changing x and y seems 
unnecessary as they are locals never used after this calculation. If I try 
to expand these equations I get:

x = x - guest_x;
guest_x = guest_x + x - guest_x;

So isn't this equivalent to just:

dx = x - guest_x;
guest_x = x;

which seems to make more sense but I don't know if it's correct.

Then this patch takes the third of dx to avoid it overshooting the desired 
value. The question is what causes this overshoot and can we calculate the 
actual value of it to compensate for it in one calculation? Isn't it the 
other line that sets guest_x to x that needs some correction?
