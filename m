Or... would it be nicer we get rid of the fdatasync() but leave that for
upper layers?  QEMU used to support file: migration already, it never
manage cache behavior; it does smell like something shouldn't be done in
QEMU when thinking about it, at least mapped-ram is nothing special to me
from this regard.

User should be able to control that either manually (sync), or Libvirt can
do that after QEMU quits; after all Libvirt holds the fd itself?  It should
allow us to get rid of above UNINTERRUPTIBLE / un-debuggable period of QEMU
went away.  Another side benefit: rather than holding all of QEMU resources
(especially, guest RAM) when waiting for a super slow disk flush, Libvirt /
upper layer can do that separately after releasing all the QEMU resources
first.

Thanks,
