Enum MigrationParameter mirrors the members of struct
MigrateSetParameters.  Differences to MigrateSetParameters's member
documentation are pointless.  Clean them up:

* @compress-level, @compress-threads, @decompress-threads, and
  x-checkpoint-delay are more thoroughly documented for
  MigrationParameter, so use that version for both.

* @max-cpu-throttle is almost the same.  Use MigrationParameter's
  version for both.
