Why is embedding a public key that will sign the IGVM in the IGVM a
chicken-and-egg problem? It's only that if db were a list of
acceptable measurements, which it isn't.
I'm not sure why relying on secure boot makes any sense for
confidential computing. I still think that tearing down the VM context
and rebuilding it is more secure, given
the need for an honest launch measurement/MRTD.

For Cloud Computing, which is the only place that FUKI makes sense as
a delivery mechanism, it's more important to rely on attestation
policy that has more awareness of the current security posture of
measurements.
Secure boot conflates authentic with secure. With a supply chain
distribution standard like CoRIM, we can ensure that individual
binaries have not only authentic measurements, but also security
version numbers (SVNs) that can be compared against a shorter-lived
endorsement of what is the most up-to-date and which CVEs are known
for lower SVNs.
Revocation is just not a real thing that works. Short-lived policy is.
Policy services can be updated more simply than the UEFI variables of
every node in the fleet.
