Noted.  As Dan says, as long as QEMU can toggle the feature on/off, then
that might be sufficient in the context of migratability.

I see; thanks for this explanation.  Your last sentence above is the
shortest summary of the CPU features situation on ARM I've ever read so
far. 

So, I infer this from what you're saying (do correct if it's wrong):

  • Currently it is impractical (not feasible?) to pull together a
    minimal-and-usable set of CPU features + their dependencies on ARM
    to come up with a "CPU model" that can work across a reasonable set
    of hardware.

  • If the above is true, then the ability to toggle CPU features on and
    off might become even more important for QEMU — if it wants to be
    able to support live migration across mixed set of hardware on ARM.  

    NB: by "mixed set of hardware", I mean hardware that is *close
    enough* (e.g. among the "Ampere Altra Family" - BTW, this "family"
    seems to be only 2 systems far).  Not arbitrarily mixed.  I did read
    your response in this thread about "who in their right mind" would
    want to migrate from Nvidia "Grace" to "AmpereOne".

Yikes!  I would use a different word, that starts with "m" and ends with
"s" (the resulting word rhymes with the latter) ;-)

Related tangent on CPU feature discoverability on ARM:

Speaking of "Neoverse-N1", looking at a system that I have access to,
the `lscpu` output does not say anything about who the integrator is; it
only says:

    ...
    Vendor ID:                ARM
    Model name:             Neoverse-N1
    ...

I realize, `lscpu` displays only whatever the kernel knows.  Nothing in
`dmidecode` either.

Also, it looks like there's no equivalent of a "CPUID" instruction (I
realize it is x86-specific) on ARM.  Although, I came across a Google
Git repo that seems to implement a bespoke, "aarch64_cpuid".  From a
what I see, it seems to fetch the "Main ID Register" (MIDR_EL1) - I
don't know enough about it to understand its implications:

    https://github.com/google/cpu_features/blob/main/src/impl_aarch64_cpuid.c

Hmm, this is "significant new information" for me.  If CPU models can't
be part of the guest ABI on ARM, then the whole "migratability across
heterogenous hardware" on QEMU requires deeper thinking.

Thanks for this discussion.
