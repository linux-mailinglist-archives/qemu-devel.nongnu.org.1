I have it all working by hand, but not in the automated test harness.

I have a script (above) that creates a test.sqf squashfs image and 
attaches it to the emulator's first hard drive. My init script tries to
mount /dev/?da /mnt and then if /mnt/init exists it runs that instead of 
launching an interactive shell prompt.

The wildcard works for /dev/hda, /dev/sda, and /dev/vda, so no matter 
which type of block device this architecture is using, the codepath to 
invoke it and to use it is generic as long as qemu can populate the bus 
and the associated kernel driver can find the device. This way I can 
test many different architectures with the same code.

Here, maybe this will help:

root/sh4/run-qemu.sh:/dev/sda
root/x86_64/run-qemu.sh:/dev/sda

The three hiccups above are sh2eb (which is building for a physical 
board so can't run that kernel under qemu), microblaze (which I 
mentioned hasn't got a working block device at all), and or1k. All the 
other architectures accept the same:

   run-qemu -hda filename

And the hardware details aren't the caller's problem. The loop calling 
each board invocation script knows nothing about the board, and doesn't 
have to. This means many different architectures can be regression 
tested in a generic fashion using a human-friendly UI option.

(The "setsid -d" is needed because otherwise if you redirect or pipe 
stdout qemu-system hangs before launching the kernel. Longstanding bug 
of many years, my notes say the hang is because qemu casts SIGTTOU on 
itself and winds up as a frog, 
https://landley.net/notes-2017.html#16-06-2017 and I thought I'd poked 
qemu-devel about it at the time...)

Yes. I want to just use -hda XYZ which for most targets "just works" 
already because the board knows where to put -hda. Unfortunately, when I 
pass -hda to qemu-system-or1k it accepts it but I can't find the 
resulting block device. (I don't know what driver I'd need to install to 
talk to wherever -hda went on or1k. I've tried tracing the code but it's 
callbacks from callbacks, like reading a choose your own adventure novel.)

Your instructions showed me how to use virtio-block-device which in 
theory should create a /dev/vda and thus work fine with the existing 
code, so I tried to supplement the existing or1k behavior to tell it 
that -hda should go to virtio. I'd be happy to change my kernel config 
to add whatever driver -hda is currently attaching the block device to 
instead, but either way I had to try to figure out how the data 
structures were initialized to, and softmmu/vl.c has:

             case QEMU_OPTION_hda:
             case QEMU_OPTION_hdb:
             case QEMU_OPTION_hdc:
             case QEMU_OPTION_hdd:
                 drive_add(IF_DEFAULT, popt->index - QEMU_OPTION_hda, 
optarg, HD_OPTS);

Which is in blockdev.c doing:

QemuOpts *drive_add(BlockInterfaceType type, int index, const char 
*file, const char *optstr)
{
     QemuOpts *opts = qemu_opts_parse_noisily(qemu_find_opts("drive"), 
optstr, false);
...
     if (type != IF_DEFAULT) {
         qemu_opt_set(opts, "if", if_name[type], &error_abort);

And figuring out where THAT's initialized (or interrogating it at 
runtime) got me as far as:

   grep -r '"device"' qapi/block-core.json

And I think I'd need to be able to use the "monitor" mode which isn't 
really compatible with my normal "serial console on stdin/stdout" use 
cases so I've never quite picked up the knack...

At that point I asked on the list, before sticking 8 zillion printf()s 
into qemu to try to figure out what it's doing.

(The OTHER hiccup is I'd like to be able to NOT use -hda and not have 
qemu abort because -device isn't consumed. I don't mind a warning, it's 
not like qemu-system isn't ridiculously chatty already, but refusing to 
start is a blocker. The guts of the scripts currently look like:

$ cat root/mips/run-qemu.sh
DIR="$(dirname $0)"; qemu-system-mips -M malta -m 256 "$@" -nographic 
-no-reboot -kernel "$DIR"/linux-kernel -initrd "$DIR"/initramfs.cpio.gz 
-append "HOST=mips console=ttyS0 $KARGS"
echo -e '\e[?7h'

So adding a couple -device potato=aardvark,micromanagement=extreme isn't 
a big change, but trying to PARSE the command line arguments and rewrite 
them is brittle and icky. (My old linux from scratch build used -hda for 
a build control image and -hdb for writeable scratch space. There was 
even the occasional -hdc...)

The $DIR shenanigans are so "subdir/run-qemu.sh -hda file" can find 
"file" out of the current directory but find the initramfs and kernel 
image out of the subdir.

The echo -e is because more than one qemu bios bootup spew (which you 
CANNOT SUPPRESS, I've tried) disables wordwrap in the terminal and 
leaves it like that on exit, and then bash's command line 
editing/history goes nuts until you type "reset". man 4 console_codes 
search for DECAWM.

> I have not used -hda before, do you have it working with other targets?

Almost all of them, yes.

In a previous life, I used this same trick to do automated native builds 
of Linux From Scratch 6.x under the emulator. I even had the emulated 
build configured to call out through the virtual network to distcc 
running on loopback on the host (which let me do an SMP build at about 
make -j3 from a single threaded host).

https://speakerdeck.com/landley/developing-for-non-x86-targets-using-qemu

Back when I maintained busybox I taught it to build Linux From Scratch, 
which allowed distros like Alpine Linux to rebase on it, and that was my 
project doing that:

https://landley.net/aboriginal/about.html
https://landley.net/aboriginal/control-images/
https://github.com/landley/control-images/tree/master/images/lfs-bootstrap
https://landley.net/aboriginal/downloads/old/binaries/1.3.0/extras/

This mkroot stuff is my successor project 
(https://landley.net/aboriginal/news.html), which I hope to get natively 
building Linux From Scratch under qemu using a toybox host someday, as 
part of my ongoing plan to turn android into a native self-hosting OS:

https://landley.net/toybox/about.html
http://lists.landley.net/pipermail/toybox-landley.net/2020-July/011898.html

Bit older and slower than I used to be. That much caffeine just gives me 
a migraine these days.

Exactly. Patching qemu to have virto be the default bus would also be 
great, you'll notice half the above targets already have -hda slot into 
/dev/vda. There used to be several actual /dev/hda in there too but Greg 
KH hates IDE the same way he hates my Pixel 3's USB tethering driver, so 
now those pretend to be scsi.

Which is why I was trying to redirect it. I dunno how to add the 
relevant code to the system setup, and it wouldn't work with the 
existing release anyway..

If "or1k can't work with -hda" I can document it as broken this release, 
but ALMOST all my targets are passing the basic smoketest! I'm so close!

$ mkroot/testroot.sh
.....................
PASS=aarch64 armv4l armv5l armv7l i486 i686 m68k mips64 mipsel mips 
powerpc64le powerpc64 powerpc riscv32 riscv64 s390x sh4 x86_64
NOPASS=microblaze or1k sh4eb
No kernel: armv7m sh2eb

Microblaze has no /dev/?da (as in there's no device I could attach it to 
even with the long option, I'd have to use NBD), sh4eb has -hda is 
working but it's having some endianness hiccup with the network card 
(works in sh4 but not sh4eb, I'm trying to track it down, I thought this 
worked at one point), and the two "No kernel" ones legitimately have no 
qemu kernel config because sh2eb is producing a kernel for a physical 
board qemu doesn't emulate (j-core turtle, I should signal that somehow 
so it doesn't show up as an error, adding a qemu-system-jcore target 
would be great but I just did 
https://landley.net/bin/mkroot/latest/linux-patches/0002-sh4-fdpic.patch 
so I can test its nommu fdpic userspace under sh4eb instead. Not perfect 
but for basic smoketests...)

And of course armv7m is a whole SAGA... 
https://landley.net/notes-2023.html#23-02-2023 and 
https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-sh/msg64491.html and... ahem. 
Tangent. Haven't got that one working yet. In theory the toolchain 
FINALLY has fdpic support, musl I'm not sure about (the toolchain I'm 
building is static pie), and I couldn't find a good kernel config that 
lined up with a qemu -M last I checked. (I've looked around for 
examples, but there's a bit of a gap between buildroot's 
configs/stm32f429_disco_xip_defconfig and configs/qemu_arm_ebbr_defconfig).
