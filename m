This makes migration-test faster by observing that most of the pre-copy
tests don't need to be doing a live migration. They get sufficient code
coverage with the guest CPUs paused.

On my machine this cuts the overall execution time of migration-test
from 13 minutes, down to 8 minutes, without sacrificing any noticeable
code coverage.

Of the tests which do still run in live mode, some need to guarantee
a certain number of iterions. This is achieved by running the 1
iteration with an incredibly small bandwidth and max downtime to
prevent convergance, and watching query-migrate for the reported
iteration to increment. This guarantees that all the tests take at
least 30 seconds to run per iteration required.

Watching for the iteration counter to flip is inefficient and not
actually needed, except on the final iteration before starting
convergance. On this final iteration we merely need to prove that
some amount of already transferred data has been made dirty again.
This in turn will guarantee that a further iteration is required
beyond the current one. This proof is easy to achieve by monitoring
the values at two distinct addresses in guest RAM, and can cut the
30 second duration down to 1 second for one of the iterations.

After this this second optimization the runtime is reduced from
8 minutes, down to 1 minute 40 seconds, which is pretty decent given
the amount of coverage we're getting.
