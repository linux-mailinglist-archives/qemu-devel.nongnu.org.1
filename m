Well I was thinking separate parameters

   backend-transfer: bool
   backend-transfer-devices: [str]   (optional list of IDs)

but it amounts to the same thing

It is worse - the backend on both sides may support transfer,
but may none the less be incompatible due to changed configuration,
so this needs mgmt app input too.

The challenge we have is that whether or not a backend supports
transfer requires fairly detailed know of QEMU and the specific
configuration of the backend. It is pretty undesirable for mgmt
apps to have to that knowledge, as the matrix of possibilities
is quite large and liable to change over time.

If we consider 'backend transfer' to be a performance optimization,
then really we want QEMU to "do the right thing" as much as is
possible.

Source and dst QEMUs don't have a bi-directional channel though,
so they can't negotiate the common subset of backends they both
support - it'll need help from the mgmt app.

One possibility is a new QMP command "query-migratable-backends"
which lists all device IDs, whose current backend configuration
is reporting the ability to transfer state. The mgmt app could
run that on both sides of the migration, take the intersection
of the two lists, and then further subtract any devices where
it has delibrately changed the backend configuration on the dst.

If we had that, then we could always pass the ID list to the
migrate command, while also avoiding hardcoding knowledge of
QEMU backend impl details - it would largely "just work".
