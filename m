Various reasons which overall point at 32-on-32 system emulation being not
used very much.

1) 32-bit has the address space size limitation, which makes it harder to
test even moderately sized (2G) guests.

2) I might be wrong but user mode emulation has no equivalent of the
forced-64bit hwaddr or ram_addr_t types; 32 bit is not very 32 bit anyway
in the case of system emulation

3) 32-bit virtualization support only exists on x86 and possibly MIPS

4) system emulation is used mostly on development systems, whereas user
mode emulation might be used on small systems to run short-lived
proprietary programs

5) for those 32-bit hosts that have a completely separate TCG backend
(well, that's Arm), getting rid TLB accesses does eliminate a bit of code.

None of them may be compelling, or maybe deprecating only one of the two
don't really make a difference in terms of maintainability, but this at
least makes the case for 32-on-32 system emulation a lot weaker.

More specifically, I don't believe anything other than 32-bit Arm hosts are
in user and for anything but user mode emulation, but those have a nonzero
chance of being in use.

Probably very easy, and I would really want to do that without even a
deprecation period.

But I also think we should still deprecate 32-bit hosts, sooner rather than

Fair enough. We have several deprecations that are in limbo and probably
won't go away soon, and it makes sense for 32-bit hosts to be another.

Also, I don't want this to look like stonewalling, so I will point out that
we can always decide to remove only *some* 32-bit hosts (or some 32-bit TCG
backends), once the deprecation countdown has ticked for some time.
