Under "make check", the top-level test in qemu.git, none. I swear on my
future grave I am trying to fix that, but there are barriers to it. Adding
make check support means installing testing dependencies in the configure
venv, which means a slower ./configure invocation. I am trying to figure
out how to minimize this penalty for cases where we either do not want to,
or can't, run the python tests. It's a long story, we can talk about it
later.

In CI, the "check-minreqs" test will run by default as a must-pass test
under the job "check python minreqs".

"check-tox" is an optional job in the CI pipeline that is allowed to fail
as a warning, due to the nature of this test checking bleeding edge
dependencies.

All three local invocations run the exact same tests (literally "make
check" in the python dir), just under different combinations of
dependencies and python versions. "check-minreqs" is more or less the
"canonical" one that *must* succeed, but as a Python maintainer I do my
best to enforce "check-tox" as well, though it does lag behind.

So, this isn't a perfect solution yet but it's certainly much better than
carrying around ad-hoc linter shell scripts and attempting to manage the
dependencies yourself. At least we all have access to the same invocations.
