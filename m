Yes, the M_TRIM_THRESHOLD option can control glibc to release the free
memory at the top of the heap, but glibc will not release the free
memory in the middle of the heap.

At least 600MB of memory is free, and this memory might be in the middle 
of the heap and cannot be automatically released.

Here is the test case:
1. start the test process

     Rss:                1504 kB

     malloc_stats:
     Arena 0:
     system bytes     =     135168
     in use bytes     =       5808
     Total (incl. mmap):
     system bytes     =     135168
     in use bytes     =       5808
     max mmap regions =          0
     max mmap bytes   =          0

2. Call malloc to allocate memory 320 times, each memory chunk is 64KiB
    and total allocated memory is 20MiB

     Rss:               21992 kB

     malloc_stats:
     Arena 0:
     system bytes     =   21049344
     in use bytes     =   20982448
     Total (incl. mmap):
     system bytes     =   21049344
     in use bytes     =   20982448
     max mmap regions =          0
     max mmap bytes   =          0

3. free the first 319 chunks , total size: 20416 KiB

     Rss:               21992 kB

     malloc_stats:
     Arena 0:
     system bytes     =   21049344
     in use bytes     =      71360
     Total (incl. mmap):
     system bytes     =   21049344
     in use bytes     =      71360
     max mmap regions =          0
     max mmap bytes   =          0

4. free the last one

     Rss:                1636 kB

     malloc_stats:
     Arena 0:
     system bytes     =     139264
     in use bytes     =       5808
     Total (incl. mmap):
     system bytes     =     139264
     in use bytes     =       5808
     max mmap regions =          0
     max mmap bytes   =          0

Yes, I have also considered implementing an automatic memory release
function within qemu. This approach would require qemu to periodically
monitor the IO load of all backend storage, and if the IO load is very
low over a period of time, it would proactively release memory.

This patch is a preliminary implementation, and I also want to discuss 
with you which implementation approach is more reasonable.

So, which approach do you prefer?
