I find it a bit of a stretch to be referring to the host-uefi-vars
feature as being "NVRAM storage". IIUC, it is effectively a command
/ response RPC service over a paravirtualized device.

IMHO this is a mistake as it isn't really the same as the
NVRAM for the flash mapping.

These two are both examples of where the analogy to the flash
mapping falls down.

The executable format in flash mapping was required because
the binaries are provided via the block backend config (-blockdev).
The list of formats conceptually would expand to anything that
is possible with -blockdev, but we artificially restricted the
schema to just raw & qcow2 since other options were somewhat
unplausible.

Similarly the flash mapping nvram again wanted a format because
it was again describing something to be used with -blockdev.

Neither of these two scenarios applies, and while we could squint
and say using "raw" is acceptable for FirmwareMemoryExecutableFormat,
using "json" is definitely not a fit as it has nothing todo with
-blockdev.

This feels very wierd talking about NVRAM again when no such concept
exists with -bios, even when the UEFI var service is present.

The 'split' concept doesn't really match what the UEFI var service
provides IMHO.

IMHO we could add merely a new "uefi-vars-service" such that it looks
like this:

     {
         "mapping: {
             "device": "memory",
             "filename": "/path/to/firmware.bin",
	     "uefi-vars-service": {
	       "template": "/path/to/firmware.json",
	     }
         }
     }

With regards,
Daniel
