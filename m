Makes sense.  For some reason I read it the other way round previously.

Let's see whether others have an opinion, but to me I think we can give it
a shot.  In that case we can "break" in the previous "ret < 0" check
already.

One more thing to mention is then I think we need to calculate the case of
"all iterators returned 1" (aka, "all completes") scenario.  With the old
check it is guaranteed if the loop iterates over all iterators then all
iterators have completed.  Now we allow ret==0 to keep iterating, then the
check needs to be done explicitly.

In general, it could be something like:

  all_done = 1;
  loop {
    ...
    ret = se->ops->save_live_iterate(f, se->opaque);
    if (ret < 0) {
      /* error handling.. */
      ...
      break;
    } else if (ret == 0) {
      all_done = 0;
    }
  }
  return all_done;

That sounds a bit tricky.  We can leave that for later until justified to
be anything useful.

Now when I checked VFIO code I found that VFIO still may have two issues:

====
1) VFIO doesn't yet respect migration_rate_exceeded()

That's the knob we use to limit send throughput when user specified the bw
to be something not zero, then throttling will apply.  Currently it seems
VFIO always sends limited data per iteration - a little bit more than
1MB-ish?  I'm mostly only looking at VFIO_MIG_DEFAULT_DATA_BUFFER_SIZE,
which seems fine, because in qemu_savevm_state_iterate() there's one more
migration_rate_exceeded() check anyway:

        if (migration_rate_exceeded(f)) {
            return 0;
        }

However it may be good that VFIO will also use migration_rate_exceeded()
inside the iterator (before we can have some better way to do throttling..).

2) vfio_save_iterate() always return 1

IIUC right now "1" means "all data is sent"?  But that seems not true for
VFIO if returned 1 every time.

I think it's not a major issue, e.g. the main migration routine even
ignored the retval of qemu_savevm_state_iterate(), the rest VFIO data
should rely on the upcoming loops over ->save_live_complete_precopy().

However I think it could already break bg_migration_iteration_run() as it
doesn't do that (it stores device state _before_ normal iterators).  But I
agree bg-snapshot is never ready with VFIO anyway and the feature itself is
probably still flaky, so not a major concern.  Just want to raise it up
when we're there.
====

Besides all above, I think we are just still not good enough to do proper
bandwidth provisioning over the iterators if the max-bandwidth is set
pretty low: even with above change to allow iterators to proceed with
ret==0, we can also hit the case where RAM is very busy, it consumes all
bandwidth, and migration_rate_exceeded() reported true, then VFIO will be
skipped again as it's after RAM iterators.  We may at least want to
remember the last time we iterated here, and then for the next iteration we
go with the handler next to it.  But that should not happen with high /
unlimited bandwidth setup, and can be another story.

Thanks,
