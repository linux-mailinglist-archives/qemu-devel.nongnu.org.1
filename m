Hi Nicolin,

Thanks for the write up and task progress status.

By this you mean the old HWPT based nested-smmuv3 support?

I might have some bandwidth starting October and can take a look at=20
task 1 above. I haven't gone through the VIOMMU API model completely
yet and plan to do that soon.

Also I am planning to attend KVM forum, so if there are anyone interested
to have  a chat on this, please let me know.

Thanks,
Shameer
