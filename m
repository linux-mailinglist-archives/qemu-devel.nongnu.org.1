QEMU options do not work with a "the user enabled then disabled the same option,
thus it'll count as nothing happened" logic. The last instance of the option will
overwrite all previous instances. In the example you mentioned above the user would
disable all mandatory extensions of rva22u64 in the CPU, doesn't matter if the
same profile was enabled beforehand.

Sure, the can put code in place to make this happen, but then this would make
profiles act different than regular extensions. "-cpu rv64,zicbom=true -cpu rv64,zicbom=false"
will disable zicbom, it will not preserve the original 'zicbom' rv64 default. If
we're going to keep left-to-right ordering consistent, this behavior should also
be consistent as well.


As for warnings, I agree that we'll throw warnings even when nothing of notice happened.
For example:

-cpu rv64,rva22u64=false -cpu rv64,rva22u64=true

This will throw a warning even though the user ended up enabling the extension
in the end.


We can fix it by postponing warnings to realize().

Ack for all the above.

The way I'm imagining this happening is to cycle through all profiles during realize(),
see which ones are enabled, and then warn if the user disabled their mandatory
extensions. In this example we would warn for all rva22 mandatory extensions
that were disabled because we disabled rva24, but we won't emit any warnings for
rva24 mandatory extensions given that the profile is marked as disabled.
