Much better, thanks. Maybe some more small clarifications as below:

machines with embedded sound hardware that can be set with the audiodev 
machine property

required a model for -audio but starting with version 8.2

I'm still not sure users will get it without additional explanation 
somewhere explicitly saying that if you now get an error with -audiodev 
driver then you may now need to use -audio driver instead (hopefully the 
error will say that) but this is now detailed enough to at least try to 
explain that.
