Yes! Good point.

The overall design is okay for me too.

I have comments about current Opaque<> implemation below...

Thanks. This cleanup is fine for me!

We should use Opaque::uninit()? Because MaybeUninit::<bindings::QEMUTimer>::zeroed()
marks the timer as initialized, which disables MaybeUninit's ability to check for
initialization. e.g.,

// No compiling error or runtime panic
let t: MaybeUninit<bindings::QEMUTimer> = MaybeUninit::zeroed();
let _t = unsafe { t.assume_init() };

Further more, I spent some time trying to figure out if MaybeUninit in
Opaque<> could help identify UB caused by uninitialized Timer, but I found
it doesn't work. :-(

There're 2 cases:

// No compiling error or runtime panic
let mut v: UnsafeCell<MaybeUninit<bindings::QEMUTimer>> = UnsafeCell::new(MaybeUninit::uninit());
let _v = unsafe { v.get_mut().assume_init() };

// Runtime panic: Illegal instruction
let t: MaybeUninit<bindings::QEMUTimer> = MaybeUninit::uninit();
let _t = unsafe { t.assume_init() };

I understand that the outer UnsafeCell wrapper makes MaybeUninit's
checks not work.

But when I adjust MaybeUninit as the outer wrapper, the UB check can
work:

// Runtime panic: Illegal instruction
let v: MaybeUninit<UnsafeCell<bindings::QEMUTimer>> = MaybeUninit::uninit();
let _v = unsafe { v.assume_init() };

And there's another example:

https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.UnsafeCell.html#method.raw_get

Compared with linux's Opaque, it also puts MaybeUninit on the outermost
layer.

Emm, I guess now we have UnsafeCell<MaybeUninit<>> because interior
mutability is expected... but this layout breaks MaybeUninit's functionality.

The SAFETY should also be ensured by MaybeUninit, I think. But I haven't
verified if MaybeUninit<UnsafeCell<>> can work on FFI case...
