Hmm, maybe it would be helpful for people who don't know what serverless 
means.

How about:
     This is useful after a long stop-const pause, which is common for 
serverless-type workloads,
     e.g. stopping/resuming the VM on every HTTP request to an endpoint, 
which might involve
     a long pause in between the requests, causing time drift in the guest.

I like this if Markus is okay with that. If we go with this, would it 
make sense to drop the "Bug" clause?
