Well, except the options that are adjusted during migration. But yes, I
agree. It all depends on how we proceed with keeping the old commands
around and for how long. If they're still around we can't stop people
from using them and later invoking "savevm" for instance.

Yes, I could perhaps reset all options once savevm is called, maybe that
would be acceptable, then we don't need to check and block every single
one. Once we add support to migration options to savevm, then they'd be
set in the savevm command-line from day 1 and those wouldn't be
reset. We could also keep HMP restricted to savevm without any migration
options. That's be easy to enforce. If the user wants fancy savevm, they
can invoke via QMP.

Yes, without migrate-set-capabilities, we'd need to pass an enormous
command line to -incoming defer to be able to enable capabilities on the
destination. With the handshake, we could transfer them over the wire
somehow. Does that make sense?
