Equivalent arm64 instruction is not valid to normal memory. Lets say
no more on that :(

So who actually cares about recovering poisoned volatile memory?
I'd like to understand more on how significant a use case this is.
Whilst I can conjecture that its an extreme case of wanting to avoid
loosing the ability to create 1GiB or larger pages due to poison
is that a real problem for anyone today?  Note this is just the case
where you've reached an actual uncorrectable error and probably
/ possibly killed something, not the more common soft offlining
of memory due to correctable errors being detected.

Maybe.  I think you can still get a media event for this as well
as synchronous poison so there may be a path to a double report, just
a more timely one hopefully.

That would work. Elide the error handling if the page is known to
be offline due to poison.  Might be racey though but does it
really hurt if we occasionally report twice?

Ah yes.  Indeed scoped_cond_guard() but fair enough on the
interruptible point!
