What behaviour would it break and how?

I can't do that because I don't quite know neither alsa nor audio in QEMU 
so I have no idea what to do. Can you give more clues?

If you know it would break something I agree it should be fixed and I can 
try but I could not reproduce any breakage and most people likely use 
other audio backends so unlikely to encounter problems with alsa.
