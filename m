I had  an initial look at this and also had some discussions with Eric at K=
VM
Forum(Thanks Eric!).

Going through the code, is it ok to introduce a "pci-bus" for the proposed
nested SMMUv3 device which will create the link between the SMMUv3 dev=20
and the associated root complex(pxb-pcie).

Something like below,

-device pxb-pcie,id=3Dpcie.1,bus_nr=3D2,bus=3Dpcie.0 \
-device arm-nested-smmuv3,pci-bus=3Dpcie.1 \
-device pcie-root-port,id=3Dpcie.port1,bus=3Dpcie.1 \
-device vfio-pci,host=3D0000:75:00.1, bus=3Dpcie.port1 \
...
-device pxb-pcie,id=3Dpcie.2,bus_nr=3D8,bus=3Dpcie.0 \
-device arm-nested-smmuv3,pci-bus=3Dpcie.2 \
-device pcie-root-port,id=3Dpcie.port2,bus=3Dpcie.2 \
-device vfio-pci,host=3D0000:75:00.2, bus=3Dpcie.port2 \

This way we can invoke the pci_setup_iommu() with the=20
right PCIBus during the nested SMMUv3 device realize fn.

Please let me know, if this works/scales with all the use cases we have.

Also Eric mentioned that when he initially added the support for SMMUv3,
the initial approach was -device based solution, but later changed to machi=
ne
option instead based on review comments. I managed to find the link where
this change was proposed(by Peter),

https://lore.kernel.org/all/CAFEAcA_H+sraWNVhEZc48eS11n6dC9CyEwTL44tPERiPBO=
+hbw@mail.gmail.com/

I hope the use cases we now have make it reasonable to introduce a "-device=
 arm-nested-smmuv3" model.
Please let me know if there are still objections to going this way.

Thanks,
Shameer
