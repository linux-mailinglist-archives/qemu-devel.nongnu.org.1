v2:

Eric noted in v1 that one of the drivers had a redundant wmask setting
since pci_pm_init() enabled writes to the power state field.  This was
added because vfio-pci was not setting wmask for this capability but
is allowing writes to the PM state field through to the device.  For
vfio-pci, QEMU emulated config space is rather secondary to the config
space through vfio.

It turns out therefore, that vfio-pci is nearly unique in not already
managing the wmask of the PM capability state and if we embrace that
it's the pci_pm_init() caller's responsibility to manage the remaining
contents and write-access of the capability, then I think we also
solve the question of migration compatibility.  The new infrastructure
here is not changing whether any fields were previously writable, it's
only effecting a mapping change based on the value found there.

This requires only a slight change to patch 1/, removing setting of
the wmask, but commit log is also updated and comments added.  I also
made the bad transition trace a little more obvious given Eric's
comments.  Patch 2/ is also updated so that vfio-pci effects the wmask
change locally.  The couple drivers that don't currently update wmask
simply don't get this new BAR unmapped when not in D0 behavior.

Incorporated reviews for the unmodified patches.  Please re-review and
report any noted issues.  Thanks,

Alex

v1:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250220224918.2520417-1-alex.williamson@redhat.com/

Eric recently identified an issue[1] where during graceful shutdown
of a VM in a vIOMMU configuration, the guest driver places the device
into the D3 power state, the vIOMMU is then disabled, triggering an
AddressSpace update.  The device BARs are still mapped into the AS,
but the vfio host driver refuses to DMA map the MMIO space due to the
device power state.

The proposed solution in [1] was to skip mappings based on the
device power state.  Here we take a different approach.  The PCI spec
defines that devices in D1/2/3 power state should respond only to
configuration and message requests and all other requests should be
handled as an Unsupported Request.  In other words, the memory and
IO BARs are not accessible except when the device is in the D0 power
state.

To emulate this behavior, we can factor the device power state into
the mapping state of the device BARs.  Therefore the BAR is marked
as unmapped if either the respective command register enable bit is
clear or the device is not in the D0 power state.

In order to implement this, the PowerState field of the PMCSR
register becomes writable, which allows the device to appear in
lower power states.  This also therefore implements D3 support
(insofar as the BAR behavior) for all devices implementing the PM
capability.  The PCI spec requires D3 support.

An aspect that needs attention here is whether this change in the
wmask and PMCSR bits becomes a problem for migration, and how we
might solve it.  For a guest migrating old->new, the device would
always be in the D0 power state, but the register becomes writable.
In the opposite direction, is it possible that a device could
migrate in a low power state and be stuck there since the bits are
read-only in old QEMU?  Do we need an option for this behavior and a
machine state bump, or are there alternatives?

Thanks,
Alex
