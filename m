Hi Sahil,

Sure, not a problem at all, also because for this year QEMU was not
accepted in GSoC, so anybody can work on those projects if they have
time

The first project is for sure related with migration. While vhost-user
memory isolation is not really related to migration, but both are
related to virtio devices.
Anyway, your plan looks good to me!

Great!

Yeah, "bite-size" issues should be better to understand how to
contribute to QEMU.
Feel free to work on any issue, doing the work or helping to complete
old patches.

Feel free to reach us if you have more questions on the projects.

Thanks,
