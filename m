You forgot to split patch 2. We cannot have a commit that revamps the
channel discovery logic and enables a new feature at the same
time. Changing the channel discovery affects all the migration
use-cases, that change cannot be smuggled along with multifd+postcopy
enablement.

Similarly, the multifd+postcopy enablement is a new feature that needs
to be tested and reasoned upon in isolation, it cannot bring along a
bunch of previously existing code that was shuffled around. We need to
be able to understand clearly what is done _in preparation for_ the
feature and what is done _as part of_ the feature.

Not to mention bisect and backporting. Many people will be looking at
this code in the future without any knowledge of migration, but as part
of a bisect section or when searching for missing backports in the
distros.

I also suggested to move that logic into channel.c. The code is now
well-contained enough that we don't need to be reading it every time
someone is going over the migration flow, it becomes just a helper
function.

I see postcopy/multifd/plain hanging from time to time. Probably due to
the changes in patch 5. Please take a look.
