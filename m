I did have a brief look through the Xilinx wiki pages to see if I could
cobble together a test case for their PetaLinux images. A bunch of pages
led to login walls which I assume are customer only. I did find:

  https://github.com/Xilinx/soc-prebuilt-firmware/tree/xlnx_rel_v2023.1/zcu=
102-zynqmp

which has a number of the components for the firmware but there was no
clear way to combine them into a single image. I did try just feeding
the ELF's to the command line but there was a clash between zynqmp_fsbl
and the bl31 (which I think is the normal ATF image).

  qemu-system-aarch64: Some ROM regions are overlapping
  These ROM regions might have been loaded by direct user request or by def=
ault.
  They could be BIOS/firmware images, a guest kernel, initrd or some other =
file loaded into guest memory.
  Check whether you intended to load all this guest code, and whether it ha=
s been built to load to the correct addresses.

  The following two regions overlap (in the cpu-memory-0 address space):
    /home/alex/lsrc/tests/testcases/zcu102-zyncmp-prebuilds/zynqmp_fsbl.elf=
 ELF program header segment 0 (addresses 0x00000000fffc0000 - 0x00000000fff=
e6058)
    /home/alex/lsrc/tests/testcases/zcu102-zyncmp-prebuilds/bl31.elf ELF pr=
ogram header segment 0 (addresses 0x00000000fffe0000 - 0x00000000ffffe000)

Most of the use cases on the Xilinx pages are hidden behind their launch
scripts for their downstream fork. It would be nice if we could get at
least one image published somewhere that we could add an avocado test
for and hopefully an entry in the Arm system emulator pages (we have
fairly complete docs for xlnx-versal-virt).
