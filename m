Calling gnutls_bye from qio_channel_tls_close is not viable for the
API contract of qio_channel_close. gnutls_bye needs to be able to
perform I/O, which means we need to be able to tell the caller
whether it needs to perform an event loop wait for POLLIN or POLLOUT.

This is the same API design scenario as the gnutls_handshake method.
As such I tdon't think it is practical to abstract it inside any
existing QIOChannel API call, it'll have to be standalone like
qio_channel_tls_handshake() is.

Daniel
