What I meant is we keep the refcount behavior consistent whenever a caller
uses memory_region_ref(), so that we always stick with 1 refcount for 99%
of users.

Yes, we have that property link that holds the MR's own refcount, but
that's the whole point of what I was trying to propose: I want to keep that
internal as of now so I hope 99% of the people may not even be aware that
such refcount existed.  I hope people stick with using memory_region_ref()
to refcount any MRs, then we only have 1 refcount which is the owner's.
And that easily makes sense because the MR is part of the owner object as a
struct field.

What your patch did is extending that single usage out to normal
memory_region_ref() callers, which I personally not prefer.

So far if with my proposal, the property link will be a solo point where
the owner says "ok I'm going to be destroyed, let's notify all the children
properties" and that includes the MR.  So that my hope was mr->refcount was
sololy for that purpose, and if for that purpose we do not need to have
that refcount to be bigger than 1 at all and it can actually be a boolean
saying whether the link existed.  I'm not saying that we need to change
that to bool but I was trying to express my point, that I want to limit
mr->refcount to minimum usage, and we stick with one refcount model by
default, rather than spreading the "there're two refcounts" idea all over.
I still think functionally they're identical but trying to stick with 1
refcount is definitely easier to follow.

Call memory_region_del_subregion() from the child says "I'm the child, now
my owner is leaving, so I need to go".  As simple as that.  Any future
reference to parent MR will keep working but not finding that child MR
anymore.  I think it's like when a device is unplugged, then the device
needs to report to its bus it's gone.  We don't have such limitation that
because a device is under a bus so only the bus can proactively unplug it.
The device can also decide to go or being unplugged by a human.  It's
pretty common thing that notifications can come from bottom, no matter why
the child needs to go.

In reality, I don't think this path is needed at all if all the owner
properly does all subregion removals..  It's more of a safety belt.
Because if there's a cross-device subregion, it means the owner must not
have been released its last refcount anyway, so the owner (together with
this child MR) must be alive.  As long as we stick with "always ref owner's
refcount" idea with my patch, this path (of addition of my patch) can only
happen when the subregion is on top of the owner's own parent MR.  It means
the link is owned by the owner and if the owner (across QEMU's tree..) does
proper removal of subregion of itself, my that path can be removed.

Fair enough.  We don't need to add that into the current discussion.

But if you see, what you're doing with this patch is actually not needed
either: when the owner of parent/child is the same, it's destined that the
added refcount on top of mr->refcount won't help to me, because the parent
needs to be alive first and that means the owner needs to be alive too.  In
general, I do think any refcount within the owner object (against any of
its own MRs as part of struct fields) do not help but waste some atomic
cycles, there's only one makes sense which is the owner<->MR property link
that takes the MR->refcount so far.

Again, we're only talking about when owner is the same between
parent/child.  I don't think that order matters, then, because in that case
as long as the parent MR is alive, owner and child MR must alive.

To me, it's still easier we always take a refcount on the owner whenever we
want to take a reference on a MR (except the only case of owner<->MR
property link), it is still easy to understand when there's the struct
field relationship between the owner and the MRs under it.  When taking
MR->refcount into the picture of memory_region_ref(), it's much harder to
understand and it's much harder to define what is MR->refcount.

So I mentioned that I can ACK this patch, but only because it looks like no
one yet agree with me, and I also agree at least with you that we should
still fix it first when there's no quorum.  I'm ok merging this one because
the changeset is small - worst case is whoever rework refcount can revert
it.  But again, that's not my preference, and I'm not convinced this is
better..
