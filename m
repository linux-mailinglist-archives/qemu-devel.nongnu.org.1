Yes, GRAPH_UNLOCKED is weak. It doesn't actually prove that the graph is
unlocked, but just flags direct callers that are known to hold the lock.
So because bdrv_try_change_aio_context() and bdrv_change_aio_context()
don't have TSA annotations, it misses the problem. If they had an
annotation, it would find the problem. (If they were GRAPH_UNLOCKED,
because they can't be called, or if they were GRAPH_RDLOCK/WRLOCK
because of double locking.)

TSA does have negative requirements that would prove it, but that would
essentially mean annotating everything in QEMU, even outside the block
layer, down to main() as GRAPH_UNLOCKED. I don't think that's practical.

Hmm, or maybe it wouldn't be that bad if we could have something like
assume_graph_unlocked()...? Not for this series anyway.

No need for the line break, it fits easily on a single line.
