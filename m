This sounds like a natural approach.

I understand this step indicates to use bindgen to generate visit_type_*
bindings...

...if so, then yes, there would be too much generated and "unsafe"
codes, and further abstraction may be needed to ensure safety, similar
to the lots of work currently done in the qemu-api.

The difference between the two frameworks is that one is for C and the
other is for Rust, which increases the maintenance burden.

Based on my understanding of the three options above, I also think that
option 1 is the more appropriate approach.
