The sev-guest compat property for 'legacy-vm-type' is an interesting
example.

This property ultimately controls which of two different kernel ioctls
for KVM are used for initializing the SEV guest. It can casue guest
VM measurement changes, but none the less this is not really a guest
ABI knob, it is a host kernel compatibility knob.  You need a newer
host kernel version if this is set to 'off'.

So by associating this legacy-vm-type type with the machine type,
we don't affect the guest hardware, but we *do* impact the ability
to use that machine type depedning on what kernel version you have.

IOW, QEMU machine types version 9.1 or later are no longer runnable
on many old kernels.

Over the years we've had a good number of occassions where we want
defaults changes, or worse, where we auto-negotiate features, which
depend on host kernel version.

I've suggested in the past that IMHO we're missing a concept of a
"versioned platform", to complement the "versioned machine" concept.

That would let mgmt apps decide what platform compatibility level
they required, independantly of choosing machine types, and so avoid
creating runability constraints on machine types.
