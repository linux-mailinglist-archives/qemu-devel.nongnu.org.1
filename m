Not to me.

Like the existing jobs, migration would be a specialization of Job.

Digression: in OO, we use subtypes for specialization.  QAPI doesn't
really support subtyping.  Instead, we commonly make do with the
old-fashioned way: unions.  For jobs, we haven't had to.  On output
(query-job, events), there has been no need for job-specific data.  On
input, we simply use job-specific commands to create the jobs.

Having a specialization refine a common state machine feels natural to
me.

Yes, these are the right questions, but we should consider external
interface in addition to implementation.

Example for reduced interface complexity: generic job-cancel superseding
migrate_cancel.

Example for improved interface: migration gaining a progress meter from
generic query-jobs.

These are the right questions whether you got all the details right or
not!

Like Kevin, I can't tell whether anybody wants this.  It does feel

Jobs use separate commands to trigger state machine state transitions:
job-resume, job-dismiss, ...

For other configuration bits that can be changed while the job runs, all
we have is block-job-set-speed and block-job-change.  Perhaps these
should both be superseded by a generic reconfiguration interface.

Migration's configuration interface has grown over many, many years, and
it shows.  This isn't criticism!  It's what happens when something is so
useful that it gets extended again and again.  We've talked about making
that interface simpler and more regular.  Extending the job interface
for migration should do that.
