Heh, true.

No. I just misunderstood the instructions, as it was not clear to me there 
that I shouldn't be adding there the HEST table.

Got it. Yeah, there was just one patch affecting DSDT table: the one
adding an AML representation for the GED notification device.

I fixed it for the next (hopefully the final) version.
