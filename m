Thanks Alex.

I was/am aware of GPA-ranges backed by mmap'ed HVA-ranges.
On further thought, I think I have all the missing pieces (except one,
as mentioned at last in current email).

I'll list the steps below :

a)
There are three stages :

   * pre-configuration by host/qemu.
   * guest-vm bios.
   * guest-vm kernel.

b)
Host procures following memory-slots (amongst others) via mmap :

  * guest-ram
  * pci-config-space       : via vfio's ioctls' help.
  * pci-bar-mmio-space : via vfio's ioctls' help.

For the above memory-slots,

*
guest-ram physical-address is known (0), so ept-mappings for guest-ram
are set up even before guest-vm begins to boot up.

*
there is no concept of guest-physical-address for pci-config-space.

*
pci-bar-mmio-space physical address is not known yet, so ept-mappings
for pci-bar-mmio-space are not set up (yet).

c)
qemu starts the guest, and guest-vm-bios runs next.

This bios is "owned by qemu", and is "definitely different" from the
host-bios (qemu is an altogether different "hardware"). qemu-bios and
host-bios handle pci bus/enumeration "completely differently".

When the pci-enumeration runs during this guest-vm-bios stage, it
accesses the pci-device config-space (backed on the host by mmap'ed
mappings). Note that guest-kernel is still not in picture.

"OBVIOUSLY", all accesses (reads/writes) to pci-config space go to the
pci-config-space memory-slot (handled purely by qemu-bios code).

Once the guest-vm bios carves out guest-physical-addresses for the
pci-device-bars, it programs the bars by writing to bars-offsets in
the pci-config-space. qemu detects this, and does the following :

   * does not relay the actual-writes to physical bars on the host.
   * since the bar-guest-physical-addresses are now known, so now the
missing ept-mappings
     for pci-bar-mmio-space are now set up.

d)
Finally, guest-kernel takes over, and

   * all accesses to ram go through vanilla two-stages translation.
   * all accesses to pci-bars-mmio go through vanilla two-stages translatio=
n.


Requests :

i)
Alex / QEMU-experts : kindly correct me if I am wrong :) till now.

ii)
Once kernel boots up, how are accesses to pci-config-space handled? Is
again qemu-bios involved in pci-config-space accesses after
guest-kernel has booted up?


Once again, many thanks to everyone for their time and help.

Thanks and Regards,
Ajay
