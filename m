Some time ago there was a discussion in the QEMU mailing list about
the situation when some IO tests were not run and thus the patch
has added a regression, namely
    https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2023-08/msg02381.html

This series contains a possible answer to the problem. Let us separate
intentional and unwanted skipping of the testcase. This patch adds new
state - 'skipped' and that state is considered as a normal skip. In the
other case we do not want that.

The series also contains some fixes which were revealed once the feature
was implemented.

Hope this would not be too bad :)
