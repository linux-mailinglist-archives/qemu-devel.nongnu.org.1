Let's put aside the qom-tree script for a moment.

In your patches, the queries return an object's properties as a list of
ObjectPropertyValue, defined as

    { 'struct': 'ObjectPropertyValue',
      'data': { 'name': 'str',
                'type': 'str',
                '*value': 'any',
                '*error': 'str' } }

As far as I understand, exactly one of @value and @error are present.

The list has no duplicates, i.e. no two elements have the same value of
"name".

Say we're interested in property "foo".  Three cases:

* The list has an element with "name": "foo", and the element has member
  "value": the property exists and "value" has its value.

* The list has an element with "name": "foo", and the element does not
  have member "value": the property exists, but its value cannot be
  gotten; member "error" has the error message.

* The list has no element with "name": "foo": the property does not
  exist.

If we simply drop ObjectPropertyValue member @error, we lose 'member
"error" has the error message'.  That's all.

If a need for more error information should arise later, we could add
member @error.  Or something else entirely.  Or tell people to qom-get
any properties qom-tree-get couldn't get for error information.  My
point is: dropping @error now does not tie our hands as far as I can
tell.

Back to qom-tree.  I believe this script is a development aid that
exists because qom-get is painful to use for humans.  Your qom-tree
command would completely obsolete it.  I wouldn't worry about it.
If you think I'm wrong there, please speak up!
