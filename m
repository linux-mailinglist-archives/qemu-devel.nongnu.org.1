I see it's defined as:

#define TCP_USER_TIMEOUT	18	/* How long for loss retry before timeout */

It doesn't look like to be the knob for the keep alive?

Since at it, I did check the relevant knobs for keep alive, and looks like
they do exist, and they can also be configured per-socket (and IIUC it
shouldn't be affected by the global configuration).  Then.. instead of this
new migration packet, how about we configure tcp keep alive on migration
sockets?  We may also not need a compat property entry.

IIUC, we need to tune below knobs:

#define TCP_KEEPIDLE		4	/* Start keeplives after this period */
#define TCP_KEEPINTVL		5	/* Interval between keepalives */
#define TCP_KEEPCNT		6	/* Number of keepalives before death */

So maybe we can setup SO_KEEPALIVE to 1 to enable keepalive, then adjust
above three knobs to make sure it HUPs properly when detecting network
down?

We figured this out offline.. :)  We'll need a compat property if going
with this approach.
