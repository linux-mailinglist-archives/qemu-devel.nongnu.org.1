Yes, this looks reasonable.
However, for Realm support, the sec_sid is not static, and can be 
changed dynamically by the device itself, after interaction with RMM 
firmware, following TDISP protocol (T bit is set in PCI transactions, 
which we don't model in QEMU).

See 3.9.4 SMMU interactions with the PCIe fields T, TE and XT.

This T bit state is currently stored out of QEMU, as we use the external 
program spdm-emu for all that. So, we implemented a very hacky solution 
detecting when this device it set in "Realm" mode based on config 
prefetch with this new sec_sid:
https://github.com/pbo-linaro/qemu/commit/c4db6f72c26ac52739814621ce018e65869f934b
It uses a dictionnary simply because of lifetime issue, as the config 
seems to be emitted before the first access of the device in our case. I 
didn't dig further. It all cases, it's ugly, not a reference, and just a 
work in progress to show you how we need to update it.

All that to said that even though we can provide this static property 
for devices that are always secure, the design will have to support 
dynamic changes as well. Not a big deal, and you can keep this out of 
scope for now, we'll change that later when adding Realms support.
As long as we have something that does not break non secure use case 
while allowing secure devices, I think we're good!

We didn't receive an answer, but after looking more at how secure world 
is modelled (with separate address space), it makes sense to have this 
description built in in the firmware or the platform itself.
