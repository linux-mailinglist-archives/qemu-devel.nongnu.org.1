I've tried this change:

diff --git a/hw/scsi/lsi53c895a.c b/hw/scsi/lsi53c895a.c
index f8598a17f5..6f547c0d33 100644
--- a/hw/scsi/lsi53c895a.c
+++ b/hw/scsi/lsi53c895a.c
@@ -860,7 +860,9 @@ static void lsi_do_command(LSIState *s)
          return;
      }

-    assert(s->current == NULL);
+    if (s->current) {
+        lsi_queue_command(s);
+    }
      s->current = g_new0(lsi_request, 1);
      s->current->tag = s->select_tag;
      s->current->req = scsi_req_new(dev, s->current->tag, s->current_lun, buf,

but then I get:

lsi_do_msgout MSG out len=1
lsi_do_msgout_select Select LUN 0
lsi_execute_script SCRIPTS dsp=0x198070 opcode 0x820b0000 arg 0x1981f8

lsi_do_command Send command len=6
lsi_queue_command Queueing tag=0x0
qemu-system-ppc: ../hw/scsi/lsi53c895a.c:677: lsi_queue_command: Assertion 
`s->current->dma_len == 0' failed.

So maybe there's some transfer in progress that would need to be finished 
or what to do in this case?
