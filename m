To me this sounds like something that should not be happening on the host unless
a real memory error is detected that blows away the whole of / most of a huge page.
I'm not sure we care about surviving that case if it isn't mapped using hugetlb/DAX or
similar in the guest (so contiguous in both with contained impact in both).

I assume the issue is backing with hugetlbfs which doesn't have a sub huge page granularity
for poison tracking.  I vaguely recall an effort to solve that
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20220624173656.2033256-1-jthoughton@google.com/
was the first thing google threw me. Looks like it got to v2.
