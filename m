For *most* of the tests, we want to ensure there are a minimum
of 2 iterations. For the XBZRLE test we want to ensure there are
a minimum of 3 iterations, so the cache gets  workout.

In general I strongly wanted to avoid adding special logic to the
migration code that makes it directly synchronize with the  test
suite, because once we do that I don't think the test suite is a
providing coverage of the real world usage scenario.

IOW, if we add a switchover-ack feature, we should certainly have
*a* test that uses it, but we should not modify other tests because
we want to exercise the logic as it would run with apps that don't
rely on switchover-ack.

Also, this slow migration test is incredibly painful for people right
now, so I'd like to see us get a speed up committed to git quickly.
I don't want to block it on a feature proposal that might yet take
months to merge.

With regards,
Daniel
