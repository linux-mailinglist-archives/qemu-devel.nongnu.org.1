Yep, will do (if I won't forget to..).

Right, we definitely want to have such job allow_failure set.. And this is
also not the only way to fail it, e.g. I just ran it on the latest 10.0 for
q35-9.2 machine type, then I spot two more failures besides what you fixed
in this series.

x1:bin [migration-staging]$ ../scripts/vmstate-static-checker.py -s ./json.9.2 -d ./json.10.0 
Section "sysbus-ahci" does not exist in dest
Section "hpet", Description "hpet": expected field "num_timers", got "num_timers_save"; skipping rest

The first one is caused by a Kconfig change - CONFIG_AHCI used to be
selected via hw/ide on x86, now since there's the new ahci-sysbus.c since
1b26146e898086 in 10.0, vmstate_sysbus_ahci isn't available anymore on x86,
but only selected by hw/arm/Kconfig even if I built the binary using
exactly the same setup.

The 2nd one is a rename which is similarly benign.  I'll throw a patch soon
for that.

If one step further.. maybe we could also cache the checker's output for
each (arch, machine type) tuple, then we mark the job fail only if the
output changes.  That may help to warn maintainers that something changed
the VMSD so one can have a look.  But we could start from simple..
