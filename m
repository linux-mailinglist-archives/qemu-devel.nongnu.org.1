I tried to manually install qpl and uadk just now but neither of them is
trivial to compile and install..  I hit random errors here and there in my
first shot.

OTOH, qatzip packages are around at least in Fedora repositories, so that
might be the easiest to reach.  Not sure how's that when with OpenSUSE.

Shall we perhaps draft an email and check with them? E.g., would that be
better if there's plan they would at some point provide RPMs for libraries
at some point so that we could somehow integrate that into CI routines?

We could, but if so it might be good to also allocate at the top level so
the hooks are paired up on these allocations/frees.

IMHO we could already always allocate iov[] to page_count+2 which is the
maximum of all compressors - currently we've got 128 pages per packet by
default, which is 128*16=2KB iov[] per channel.  Not so bad when only used
during migrations.

Or we can perhaps do send_setup(..., &iovs_needed), returns how many iovs
are needed, then multifd allocates them.
