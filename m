When I said "memory management" I meant the methods we use to allocate 
and free memory (the Linux equivalents would be kmalloc()/free()/kref), 
not the MM tracking or unassigned MR trapping behavior you mentioned. 
The unassigned MR trap and MMIO/alias movement are a separate concern 
and don’t change the underlying risk.

Concrete example: imagine an alias is allocated with g_new() and freed 
immediately after object_unparent(). If that alias accidentally becomes 
the FlatView root, destroying the FlatView later will call 
memory_region_unref() and produce a use-after-free. We cannot predict 
what memory_region_unref() will read or write in that scenario — the 
result can be arbitrary memory corruption that surfaces much later as a 
hard-to-debug, intermittent problem. Users often won’t file an issue for 
these rare corner cases.

Regarding your preference to fix only explicit problems: I understand 
the conservatism, but here are the facts we need to weigh:

- The documentation claims we may free aliases because
   memory_region_ref() is never called, yet there is code that does call
   memory_region_ref().
- The patch adds code to align behavior with the documentation.

The significance of both potential impacts (the behavioral divergence 
for devices other than pci-bridge, and the added complexity needed for 
consistency) may be subjective and hypothetical, but that applies 
equally to both sides.

In this case, the long-term reliability and maintainability of QEMU 
depend on having the code behave as documented. Correctness should take 
precedence over simplicity.
