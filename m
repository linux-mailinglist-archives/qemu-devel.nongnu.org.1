I agree we should deprecate the invalid DT usage, with the goal of only
generating DTs that make the validator happy. I'm not sure how long that
deprecation period should be, though. It may need to be a while since
we'll need to decide when we've waited long enough to no longer care
about older kernels. In the meantime, we won't be making the validator
happy and may get bug reports due to that. With strct-dt we can just
direct people in that direction. Also, I wouldn't be surprised if
something else like this comes along some day, which is why I tried to
make the option as generic as possible. Finally, the 'if (strict_dt)'
self-documents to some extent. Otherwise we'll need to add comments
around explaining why we're diverging from the specs. Although we should
probably do that anyway, i.e. I should have put a comment on the
'if (strict-dt) then #msi-cells' explaining why it's under strict-dt.
If we want strict-dt, then I'll send a v2 doing that. If we don't want
strict-dt then I'll send a v2 with just a comment explaining why
#msi-cells was left out.

Thanks,
drew
