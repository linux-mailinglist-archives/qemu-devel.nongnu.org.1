Note that command is running both the compile and test phases of
the job. Overcommitting CPUs for the compile phase is a good
idea to keep CPUs busy while another process is waiting on
I/O, and is almost always safe todo.

Overcommitting CPUs for the test phase is less helpful and
can cause a variety of problems as you say.

In contributor forks, gitlab CI will be using the public shared
runners. These are Google Cloud VMs, which only have 2 vCPUs.

In the primary QEMU repo, we have a customer runner registered
that uses Azure based VMs. Not sure on the resources we have
configured for them offhand.

The important thing there is that what you see for CI speed in
your fork repo is not neccessarily a match for CI speed in QEMU
upstream repo.

The question is what impact that has on the overall job execution
time. A lot of our jobs are already quite long, which is bad for
the turnaround time of CI testing.  Reliable CI though is arguably
the #1 priority though, otherwise developers cease trusting it.
We need to find the balance between avoiding timeouts, while having
the shortest pratical job time.  The TCI job you show abuot came
out at 22 minutes, which is not our worst job, so there is some
scope for allowing it to run longer with less parallelism.

Timeouts for individual tests are a relatively  recent change to
QEMU in:

  commit 4156325cd3c205ce77b82de2c48127ccacddaf5b
  Author: Daniel P. Berrangé <berrange@redhat.com>
  Date:   Fri Dec 15 08:03:57 2023 +0100

    mtest2make: stop disabling meson test timeouts

Read the full commit message of that for the background rationale,
but especially this paragraph:

    The main risk of this change is that the individual test timeouts might
    be too short to allow completion in high load scenarios. Thus, there is
    likely to be some short term pain where we have to bump the timeouts for
    certain tests to make them reliable enough. The preceeding few patches
    raised the timeouts for all failures that were immediately apparent
    in GitLab CI.

which highlights the problem you're looking at.

The expectation was that we would need to bump the timeouts for various
tests until we get the the point where they reliably run in GitLab CI,
both forks and upstream.

With regards,
Daniel
