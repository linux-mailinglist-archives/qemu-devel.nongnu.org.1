Ah sorry, yeah I meant use_tmp_memfile..

It's about when there're shmem tests added without postcopy, we may want
the host to run these tests even if that host doesn't support userfault
syscall.

$ grep -iE "(SHMEM|USERFAULTFD)=" .config
CONFIG_SHMEM=y
CONFIG_USERFAULTFD=y

So I want to make sure the test runs the right thing always, irrelevant of
which arch it ran on, or kernel config.

I agree that's not a huge deal, but still I wanted to remove the
collreation that userfault and shmem is closely related - they're just
totally irrelevant to me, e.g., we can have shmem test/hostconfig without
userfault, we can also have userfault test/hostconfig without shmem.

Yep, and IMHO that's also why I think we can start trying this even on
GITLAB_CI if it can support it.

The question is why it can fail even with fallocate() around.  I just don't
see how it can fail besides either succeed or skip.

Maybe I missed something alone the lines.. though.

The other test (e.g. ivshmem) can fail, but those can fail with/without
the change here.  That's also why I think we need to fix them separately,
rather than trying to detect GITLAB_CI only because we know they _might_ be
running concurrently - if all tests have protection over shmem allocation
then IIUC we shouldn't fail anymore, but only success/skip.

I agree this doesn't look good at all, as it's not predictable on what test
will be covered in a CI run.. but again IMHO that's yet another separate
issue on how we can make CI support enough shmem usages.

Thanks,
