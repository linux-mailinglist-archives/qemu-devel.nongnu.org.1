This is starting to become a little unmanageable. :-)

I'm sure we could keep adding more and more cleanup patches with each
version of the series, but we don't really have to let the first fixes
wait for all cleanups and fix the whole world in a single series.

So I decided to start with a prefix of this series and applied
patches 1-22, which all had received review before and were easy to
compare against the previous version. If you don't object, I'd send a
pull request for those without waiting for the rest.

If the other patches still need some changes, you can start a new patch
series at v1 containing the remaining patches. (No need to resend them
now, though, I can review them in this series.)

Does this make sense to you?

Kevin
