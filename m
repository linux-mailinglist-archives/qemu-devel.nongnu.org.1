I didn't want to touch drive-mirror, since it is an older command that
has some awkward semantics that were improved on when we added
blockdev-mirror (that's why libvirt only uses blockdev-mirror).  If we
still think it is worth bolting features onto the old command, instead
of encouraging users to migrate to the new one, then that should be a
separate patch.

Determination of whether a pre-existing image is fully
zero-initialized for drive-mirror comes for free later in the patch
series (at the same time that blockdev-mirror is able to infer that
information without an explicit target-is-zero parameter).
