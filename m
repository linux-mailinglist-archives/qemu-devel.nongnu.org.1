I am not able to distinguish between the images as they are in binary form,
I noticed that the smaller size image can boot in Qemu.
I normally put the image into an SD card of the real hardware to boot.
so it is quite difficult for me now to distinguish.

ahh, that also makes sense, ok now let me try to convert the images, and
let's see.
Does Qemu provide such a tool or do you know any?
