Yes.

Above system's kernel is probably older, and doesn't know about Power11.

Power11 support was added in upstream linux, with commit c2ed087ed35c 
("powerpc: Add Power11 architected and raw mode").

Also, if you notice the model is being printed as 0x00821200, it is the 
Processor version register (PVR), the 0x82 in it is for Power11. If it 
had been Power10, it would be 0x80. You can try that with -cpu Power10.


You will need to use a kernel newer than v6.9-rc1, which contains the 
commit adding Power11 support to the kernel.


Thanks,

Aditya Gupta
