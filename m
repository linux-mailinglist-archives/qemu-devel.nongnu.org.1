I do git pull on qemu and have an old kernel. My setup just
became buggy. No?

All I am saying is that I want to see how is management supposed to
know what to enable.

qemu already probes tap features. To me, it seems natural
for management to do the probing through qemu.
in fact your patch is a way to do that, is it not?
what it lacks though is a structured way to tell management how
to fix the problem.
