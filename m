Yes.

Yes. But mostly because MigrationConfig will become the type for the new
'*config' argument to migrate/migrate_incoming (patches 12 & 13) and we
want to keep all members optional. Otherwise the user would have to pass
all ~50 migration options in every migrate command, which is bad IMO.

Ok, I'll reorganize, along with the other comments you've made.

Yes, that's the main point indeed.

Yes. Up until this point I'm keeping everything compatible, only
switching to use MigrationConfig internally. Come patch 12, when we
expose this type externally, it will be time to decide whether to
declare that the new way of setting migration configuration options
treats the empty string as invalid. I haven't made the call yet because
I wanted some feedback on the new commands, backward compatibility, etc.
