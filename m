It should be possible to assign addr automatically without requiring 
user to specify the stride. I'll try that in the next version.

Yes, rocker does that. But the problem is not just about getting 
parameters needed for VFs, which I forgot to mention in the cover letter 
and will explain below.

I wrote it's to store the device options, but the problem is actually 
more about realizing VFs at runtime instead of at the initialization time.

Realizing VFs at runtime have two major problems. One is that it delays 
the validations of options; invalid options will be noticed when the 
guest requests to realize VFs. netdevs also warn that they are not used 
at initialization time, not knowing that they will be used by VFs later. 
References to other QEMU objects in the option may also die before VFs 
are realized.

The other problem is that QEMU cannot interact with the unrealized VFs. 
For example, if you type "device_add virtio-net-pci,id=vf,sriov-pf=pf" 
in HMP, you will expect "device_del vf" works, but it's hard to 
implement such behaviors with unrealized VFs.

I was first going to compromise and allow such quirky behaviors, but I 
realized such a compromise is unnecessary if we reuse the PCI power down 
logic so I wrote v2.
