That's also true for other registers marked with ARM_CP_ALIAS and 
exposed to GDB so I followed those examples. It's up to user what 
register to choose after all.

I suspect that some registers with ARM_CP_NO_RAW cannot be determined as 
GDB-visible or GDB-invisible based on the current ARMCPRegInfo fields, 
and explicit marking with some flag is inevitable for them.

That said, I understand explicit markings with ARM_CP_NO_GDB may 
interfere with the future design work, and I think I can still solve the 
problem with PMCNTENCLR and similar registers without it. Below is a 
detailed explanation:

The underlying problem here is that the current definitions of 
ARM_CP_ALIAS and ARM_CP_NO_RAW are contradicting and incompatible.

Now let me describe characteristics of PMCNTENCLR with yes/no table:
1) It has a state - yes
2) It will handle migration and reset - no
3) The state can be synchronized with KVM - no
4) The state is shared with another register - yes

1) the presence of the state usually implies it is visible to GDB.

The documentation of ARM_CP_ALIAS says:
 > Register is an alias view of some underlying state which is also
 > visible via another register, and that the other register is handling
 > migration and reset; registers marked ARM_CP_ALIAS will not be
 > migrated but may have their state set by syncing of register state
 > from KVM.

So ARM_CP_ALIAS implies:
1) It has a state - yes
2) It will handle migration and reset - no
3) The state can be synchronized with KVM - yes
4) The state is shared with another register - yes

1) is implied from 3) and 4); if there is no state, the state cannot be 
synchronized and cannot be shared with another register.

The documentation of ARM_CP_NO_RAW says:
 > Register has no underlying state and does not support raw access for
 > state saving/loading; it will not be used for either migration or KVM
 > state synchronization. Typically this is for "registers" which are
 > actually used as instructions for cache maintenance and so on.

So ARM_CP_NO_RAW implies:
1) It has a state - no
2) It will handle migration and reset - no
3) The state can be synchronized with KVM - no
4) The state is shared with another register - n/a (there is no state)

It also makes the register invisible from GDB since there is no 
underlying state.

As you can see, ARM_CP_ALIAS and ARM_CP_NO_RAW have contradicting 
semantics. A minimal change to make them compatible is to explicitly 
define what (ARM_CP_ALIAS | ARM_CP_NO_RAW) implies:
1) It has a state - yes (it has a state shared with its alias)
2) It will handle migration and reset - no
3) The state can be synchronized with KVM - no (due to no raw access)
4) The state is shared with another register - yes

More concretely, the documentation of ARM_CP_NO_RAW can be changed as 
follows:
"Register does not support raw access for state saving/loading; it will 
not be used for either migration of KVM state synchronization. It also 
implies reading the register does not expose a state and hides it from 
GDB unless ARM_CP_ALIAS is set."

With this change, we can express the semantics of PMCNTENCLR without 
extra explicit markings of ARM_CP_NO_GDB and any contradiction in code. 
This explanation is long but the code change should be minimal.

What do you think?
