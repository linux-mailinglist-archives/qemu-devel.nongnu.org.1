Naming is hard.

I'd be tempted by ObjectProperty if it wasn't already taken by
qom/object.h.

Let's converge on the code, and maybe revisit naming at the end.

Yup.  I'll clean them up.

I like to stick to GenericError, I like consistency, I can't have both.
Go with simpler code?

Yes, that's a documented feature.

I propose you respin without qom-tree first.  The patches will get
simpler, and review hopefully more focused.
