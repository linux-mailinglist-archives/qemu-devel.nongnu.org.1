Yes this wasn't meant for the distro case, you're correct.

Rust crates.io dependencies tend to "explode" due to the large number of 
transitive dependencies and even different versions of the same crates.

Here's an example:

https://landaire.net/on-dependency-usage-in-rust/#what-about-dependency-explosion

This is something to be aware of in general when pulling dependencies.

That was my reasoning for using the bitfield crate to represent UART 
registers.

Sorry, I meant using cargo without network access. This requires setting 
up the registry index and caches on your $CARGO_HOME

Agreed.
