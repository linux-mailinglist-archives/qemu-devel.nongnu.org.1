cache controller registers you could emulate the one that maps the cache at=
 some address as sram then the BOOT table at the beginning of the SD card s=
hould write that to map it at the right place so if you also have code to p=
arse that then no sparse-mem should be needed on the command line=2E Or is =
that some other register not part of l2cache? But this is something that ca=
n be sorted later so not a big deal, until then adding s memory region ther=
e either from board code or from command line will do=2E I think I get now =
that maybe you mean that command line is better because different boards ha=
ve this at different location so you need to specify the address and that's=
 easier with -device=2E

The l2cache controller manages 256kB of memory which is configured as cach=
e by default=2E The Tabor BOOT table configures part of it as RAM which inv=
olves mapping just that part into the address space=2E The SPL gets copied =
into  into it and is executed from there=2E At runtime the SPL sets up a st=
ack=2E This is another memory region disjoint from the SPL's=2E Rather than=
 configuring the new region as RAM, you can think of this region to be mark=
ed just as cacheable in the MMU=2E Hence, when the SPL uses this region as =
stack, the data will be captured by the cache rather than ending up in the =
void=2E In QEMU, the l2cache implementation creates the SPL region and the =
stack region is modeled by the sparse-mem device in order to avoid implemen=
ting a cache=2E
