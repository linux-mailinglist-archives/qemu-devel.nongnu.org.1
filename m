2 is going above and beyond :). I'm not trying to make life hard.

Another option if 1 or 2 are difficult to quantify: I'd be happy with
just a "before" and "after" disassembly snippet from objdump showing
that the instructions at a call site changed as intended.

What I'm looking for is a commit description that explains the purpose
of the commit followed by, since this is a performance improvement,
some form of evidence that the change achieved its goal. At that point
it's easy for me to merge because it has a justification and the
nature of the commit will be clear to anyone looking at the git log in
the future.

Can you explain 3 more? Total code size on disk should stay about the
same because most trace events only have one call site. Moving code
between the caller and callee doesn't make a big difference in either
direction. At runtime there is a benefit from inlining the condition
check since the call site no longer needs to execute the callee's
function prologue/epilogue when the trace event is runtime-disabled,
but that CPU cycle and instruction cache effect won't be visible from
the on-disk code size.

Thanks,
Stefan
