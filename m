+Dan.

Yes probably the buffering is still needed ultimately.  It's just that it
currently involves qemufile which is (hopefully..) destined to be either
removed or updated.

For this cpr states, I'm not sure the buffered iochannel is a must, e.g. I
wonder what happens if we start with using iochannels directly without
buffering, then after replacing that with buffered iochannels, it'll simply
improve on top without changing much of the code - I mean, buffered
iochannel should still be able to be casted into an iochannel anyway.

Right, right after I sent the email I noticed this too..

The chance is the new iochannel API only resolves whatever needed for cpr
early states, currently:

static const VMStateDescription vmstate_cpr_state = {
    .name = CPR_STATE,
    .version_id = 1,
    .minimum_version_id = 1,
    .pre_save = cpr_state_presave,
    .fields = (VMStateField[]) {
        VMSTATE_UINT32(mode, CprState),
        VMSTATE_QLIST_V(fds, CprState, 1, vmstate_cpr_fd, CprFd, next),
        VMSTATE_END_OF_LIST()
    }
};

static const VMStateDescription vmstate_cpr_fd = {
    .name = "cpr fd",
    .version_id = 1,
    .minimum_version_id = 1,
    .fields = (VMStateField[]) {
        VMSTATE_UINT32(namelen, CprFd),
        VMSTATE_VBUFFER_ALLOC_UINT32(name, CprFd, 0, NULL, namelen),
        VMSTATE_INT32(id, CprFd),
        VMSTATE_FD(fd, CprFd),
        VMSTATE_END_OF_LIST()
    }
};

IIUC, a summary of a few things only so far: UINT32/INT32, VBUFFER, FD.
Here FD is the new one, which we'll need to support that anyway, either
with the qemufile API or iochannel API.  Then the rest looks pretty
limited.  IOW, the new iochannel-based vmstate_load() doesn't yet need to
know anything else but these types of fields.  While I don't think I have a
full grasp yet on everything; that just sounds like the right direction to
go for the longer term.

Said that, as you said there can still be plenty of work there.  Steve,
feel free to think about it and take whatever approach you like.

Thanks,
