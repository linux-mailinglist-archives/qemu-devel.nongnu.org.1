There's probably still a bug somewhere.  If reproduction rate changed, it's
also a sign that it might not be directly relevant to this change, as
otherwise it should reproduce the same as before.

I don't have a solid clue yet, but more information of the single case
where it reproduced could help.

I saw from the bug link that the cmdline is pretty simple.  However still
not sure of something that can be relevant.  E.g., did you use postcopy
(including when postcopy-ram enabled but precopy completed)?  Is there any
special device, like s390's CMMA (would that simplest cmdline include such
a device; apologies, I have zero knowledge there before today)?

I _think_ when reading the code I already found something quite unusual,
but only when postcopy is selected: I notice postcopy will frequently sync
dirty bitmap while it doesn't really necessarily need to, because
ram_state_pending_estimate() will report all ram as "can_postcopy"; it
means it's highly likely that this check will 99.999% always be true simply
because must_precopy can in most cases be zero:

    if (must_precopy <= s->threshold_size) { <---------------------------- here
        qemu_savevm_state_pending_exact(&must_precopy, &can_postcopy);
        pending_size = must_precopy + can_postcopy;
        trace_migrate_pending_exact(pending_size, must_precopy, can_postcopy);
    }

I need to think more of this, but this doesn't sound right at all.  There's
no such issue with precopy-only, and I'm surprised it is like that for years.
