After looking at the rest of the series, this is probably not what we
want either.

I think a big part of the problem why this device is hard to understand
is that it's too much centered around what the host does rather than
what the core logic of the device is. Which is really simple:

    while (!unrealizing) {
        cbw = read_in_packet();
        req = start_scsi_req();
        ret = wait_for_scsi_req(req);
        write_out_packet(status_to_csw(ret));
    }

This flow (which is really Figure 1 in Chapter 5 in the spec) is nowhere
to be seen in the code. Can we change things to look more like this?
Could be almost literally this if we make it coroutine based, or just
the callback based equivalent of it.

And then when we receive a packet, we just queue it as the next in or
out packet, and leave it to the main state machine/coroutine to make use
of the packet or wait for one if it's missing.
