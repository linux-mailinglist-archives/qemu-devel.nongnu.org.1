We are slowly expanding the capabilities although we don't want to go to
fast lest we introduce APIs we need to fix later. That said we carry the
warning that the plugin API "reserves the right to change or break the
API should it need to do so" so hopefully plugin authors know what to
expect.

I will defer to the *-user maintainers here. One thing we are keen to
avoid is plugins being used as a mechanism to work around the GPL
requirements of QEMU itself. It would be useful if you could outline the
use case for a plugin doing the emulation itself?

I'm fairly sure there are some syscalls where the plugin wouldn't be able to
do an emulation that makes sense, for example fork/vfork/execve because
QEMU itself has to do a bunch of housekeeping to keep track of stuff.

Also while the write memory helpers can take the place of QEMU's own
logic they come with a bunch of caveats about memory consistency. There
is stuff we do during lock_user() which those mechanisms don't.

Another option would be to have a set_pc function that would restart the
execution at new PC. Then the vcpu_syscall_cb callback could set the PC
to post the syscall with whatever state it wants to set up.
