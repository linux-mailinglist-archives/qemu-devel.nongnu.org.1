Thanks for identifying this.

When you say there are no DKIM records for huawei.com, do you mean
that my @huawei.com mails do not contain any DKIM-Signature header,
or that a DKIM-Signature is present but cannot be validated against
a published key?

If there are SPF/DKIM/DMARC logs on the list side, would it be
possible to see whether DKIM validation is failing for my messages?

Agreed. I will check with the IT department here about the DKIM
headers and whether the public key is being published correctly.

Agreed.

This is not always true.

Mails disappear or not appear in the mailing list even when I reply
via outlook and the same happens when I sometimes use git-send-mail.

check these:
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20251001010127.3092631-1-salil.mehta@opn=
src.net/

AND

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/CAJ7pxea721f4EwqpDdcztgRoN-rsB2tqthf-_Kb=
+mmsRkK1GyQ@mail.gmail.com/

I'm replying to this broken link which existed but disappeared later.
 [not found] <20250930224037.224833-1-salil.mehta@huawei.com>

This configuration is correct. With this configuration, no mail will be sen=
t
outside Huawei. There are other addresses as well in the TO/CC list.
I'll rule out this aspect.

It must be the correct one because I attached the .eml for the received mai=
l.
And I really don't have a clue how this address is different from  the
other i.e.
@os.amperecomputing.com

[+] Adding Vishnu to CC, maybe he can share more details and share his
.eml file.

Could be. Do we have access to the logs to verify the reason?
