Not worth the extra instructions in my opinion. It would crash
immediately once the thread touches p->iov anyway.

Sorry, this one shouldn't have that text.

No, I meant called as a result of multifd_send(), which is the function
the client uses to trigger a send on the thread.

I understand that part is not in the best shape, but we must document
the current state. There's no problem changing this later.

Besides, there's the whole "the migration stream should be considered
hostile" which might mean we should really be keeping these sanity check
flags around in case something really weird happens so we don't carry on
with a bad stream.

Same as before. I'll reword this somehow.
