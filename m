Hmm, yes, seem I missed this side effect.

Bringing back this one object_property_set_int() call would be the
easiest fix, but I wonder if an explicit add_boot_device_path() call
(and allowing that one to fail gracefully instead of directly calling
exit()) wouldn't be better than re-setting a property to its current
value just for the side effect.

I don't think the other properties whose setter we don't call any more
have side effects. They are processed during .realize, which is what I
probably expected for bootindex, too.

And that's really how all properties should be if we ever want to move
forward with the .instance_config approach for creating QOM objects
because then we won't call any setters during object creation any more,
they would only be for runtime changes.
