That is totally fine, and an example of an expected scenario
that the simple shell 1-liner above can't eliminate.

I don't see any problems with the commit messages as already written and
imho don't think we need to change it.

The main scenario that I would say is invalid is a commit containing
/only/ a matching rb/sob pair e.g.

 Reviewed-by: Daniel P. Berrangé <berrange@redhat.com>
 Signed-off-by: Daniel P. Berrangé <berrange@redhat.com>

as that is clearly either a "marking your own homework" case, or
someone has forgot to update the R-b/SoB tags.

With regards,
Daniel
