&gt;=C2=A0 &gt;=C2=A0 changed? Reasonable reasons might include:<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0* we&#39;re out of spec based on reading the do=
cumentation<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0* you&#39;re trying to run some old Windows VM/=
QNX/etc image,<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0and it doesn&#39;t work any more<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0* all the real hardware we tested behaves this =
way<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 &gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 &gt;=C2=A0 But don&#39;t necessarily include:<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0* something somebody wrote and only tested on Q=
EMU happens to<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0assume the old behaviour rather than fol=
lowing the hw spec<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 &gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 &gt;=C2=A0 QEMU occasionally works around guest OS bugs, but onl=
y as<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 &gt;=C2=A0 when we really have to. It&#39;s usually better to fi=
x the<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 &gt;=C2=A0 bug in the guest.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 &gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 &gt; It&#39;s not, and I&#39;ve already demonstrated that real h=
ardware is consistent with the fix in this patch.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 &gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 &gt; Please check your tone.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 I don&#39;t think that is a particularly helpful comment for som=
eone who is<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 taking the time to review your patches. Reading through the thre=
ad I<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 didn&#39;t see anything that said this is how real HW behaves bu=
t I may well<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 have missed it. However you have a number of review comments to =
address<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 so I suggest you spin a v2 of the series to address them and out=
line the<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 reason to accept an out of spec transaction.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I did a rework of the patch -- see my email from May 20, quoted below =
-- and I was under the impression it addressed all the<br>
&gt; review comments. Did I miss something? I apologize if I did.<br>
<br>
Ahh I see - I&#39;d only seen this thread continue so wasn&#39;t aware a ne=
w<br>
version had been posted. For future patches consider using -vN when<br>
sending them so we can clearly see a new revision is available.<br>

&gt;&gt; Reading through the thread I didn&#39;t see anything that said thi=
s is how real HW behaves but I may well have missed it.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; This is what I wrote regarding real HW:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Results are:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 qemu 4.2=C2=A0 =C2=A0| qemu HEAD=C2=A0 | actual HW<br>
&gt; ------------+------------+------------<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 works fine | ohci_die() | works fine<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Would additional verification of the actual HW be useful?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Peter posted the following which is more specific than &quot;qemu 4.2&=
quot; -- I agree this is most likely the qemu commit where this<br>
&gt; thread is focused:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Almost certainly this was commit 1328fe0c32d54 (&quot;hw: usb: hcd=
-ohci:<br>
&gt;&gt; check len and frame_number variables&quot;), which added these bou=
nds<br>
&gt;&gt; checks. Prior to that we did no bounds checking at all, which<br>
&gt;&gt; meant that we permitted cbp=3Dbe+1 to mean a zero length, but also=
<br>
&gt;&gt; that we permitted the guest to overrun host-side buffers by<br>
&gt;&gt; specifying completely bogus cbp and be values. The timeframe is<br=
>
&gt;&gt; more or less right (2020), at least.<br>
&gt;&gt; <br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; Where does the conversation go from here? I&#39;m under the impression=
 I have provided objective answers to all the questions<br>
&gt; and resolved all review comments on the code. I receive the feedback<b=
r>
&gt; that I missed something - please restate the question?<br>
<br>
I can see patch 1/2 has been queued and 2/2 is still outstanding. I&#39;m<b=
r>
having trouble finding the referenced entry in the OHCI spec. The only<br>
one I can see is Release 1.1, January 6th, 2000 and that doesn&#39;t have a=
<br>
section 4.3.1.2.<br>
<br>
I think discussion should continue on that thread.<br></blockquote><div><br=
