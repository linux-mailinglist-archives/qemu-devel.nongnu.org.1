At the meson level though, we can't put an overall cap on
the execution time, as there's only 1 huge test visible,
and thus the meson timeout multiplier also won't get
honoured IIUC.

IMHO you can just make an executive decision and pick one of those
three. None of them are terrible, any would be a valid choice.

A wierd acronym isn't really going to tell contributors anything about
what this is, compared to calling it 'functional' or 'integration', etc.
