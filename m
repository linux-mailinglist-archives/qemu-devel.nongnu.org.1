I don't think so - 'qemu -dump-vmstate' should dump all device states that
it ever supports.  Feel free to have a look at dump_vmstate_json_to_file(),
or just try give it a dump.

I didn't see Markus acked all the patches yet, but if so that's okay then.
Even if so, I think what Peter Maydell suggested is then this series should
go through the QOM tree, rather than a separate pull.
