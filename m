No argument.

The original design idea is simple: #ifdef CONFIG_FOO for QAPI schema,
to not generate dead code, and to not have silly stubs.  Even if you
don't care about wasting disk and address space, you probably care about
wasting developer time on writing silly stubs and waiting for dead code
to compile.

Initially, target-specific macros did not work in conditions.  That was
easy enough to fix, so we did.

However, target-specific conditions turned out less useful than
anticipated.  Adding a target-specific conditional anywhere in a
definition makes the entire definition and its users target-specific.
This can make handwritten code artificially target-specific, which is
undesirable.

Target-specific conditions now also complicate the single binary work.

I'm not sure I have all this present in my mind...  Can you summarize
what troubles you?  Or point me to the message(s)?

How does cache invalidation work?  Timestamp of binary?

Back when I created QAPI/QMP introspection, I floated the idea to put
something into the QMP greeting to enable safe caching.  Libvirt
developers told me they didn't need that.  I don't remember the details,
but I guess the cache invalidation they already had was deemed good
enough.

This is actually independent of "single binary".

query-qmp-schema's value will be the same for all qemu-system-FOO built
from same QAPI schema source and configuration.

If there are no target-dependent conditionals, schema configuration is
the same regardless of target.

Of course, capability probing can go beyond query-qmp-schema, but you
get the idea.

Have a message digest of query-qmp-schema's value in the QMP greeting.
Management application uses it as key to cache probe results.

Schema fixed at build time is a fundamental design choice we made for
QAPI.

It limits the questions schema introspection can answer.  Can affect
valid questions, but that doesn't mean we have to answer them via schema
introspection.  We've been tempted to answer them via schema
introspection because schema introspection has been such a success.

We may need to think about replacements better than "add yet another ad
hoc query command" and "QOM tree spelunking".  Not a blocker.
