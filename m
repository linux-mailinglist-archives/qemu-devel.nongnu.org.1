In the case of hw-passthrough hot-plug, what isn't known?:
a) domain:b:d.f is known
b) thus its hierarchy and SMMUv3 association in the host is known
c) thus, if the (accel) features of the SMMUv3 were exposed (known),
    then the proper setup (separate SMMUv3 vs system-wide-emulated SMMUv3;
    association of (allocated/configured) vSMMUv3 to pSMMUv3 would be known/made

What else is missing?

At a qemu-cmd level, the right number & config of smmuv3's, but
libvirt, if it had the above info, could auto-generate the right number
of smmuv3's (stages, accel-features, etc.) ... just as it does today in
creating the right number of pcie bus's, RPs, etc. from simple(r)
device specs into more complete, qemu configs.

I don't see how iommufd would 'get-info' the needed info any better
than any other interface/subsystem.  ...

and, if architected correctly, even in (device-specific) sw-provided tables,
it could be 'formatted' in a way that it was discoverable by the appropriate layers
(libvirt, qemu).
Once discoverable, this whole separate accel device -- which is really an
attribute of an SMMUv3 -- can be generalized, and reduced, to a much
smaller, simpler, sw footprint, with the concept of callbacks (as the series
uses) to enable hw accelerators to perform the shadow-ops that fully-emulated
smmuv3 would have to do.

It would make machine-level definitions far more portable if the
working/non-working, and the one-accel, or two-accel, or three-accel, or ...
features were dynamically determined  vs a static (qemu) machine config, that would have
to be manipulated each time it ran on a different machine.

e.g., cluster sw scans servers for machines with device-X.
       create VMs, assigning some/all of device-X to a VM via its own smmuv3. done.
       Now, if the smmuv3 features were exposed all the way up to userspace,
       then one could argue the cluster sw could scan for those features and add it
       to the accel=x,y,z option of the smmuv3 associated with an assigned device.
       potato/po-tah-toe cluster sw or libvirt or qemu or <something-else> scans/reads
        ... discoverability of the features has to be done by
       (a) a computer, or (b) an error-prone human.
      ... all that AI gone to waste ... ;-)
