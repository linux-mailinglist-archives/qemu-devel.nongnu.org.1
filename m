Original (very broken) v1 posting:

  https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2025-10/msg01650.html

The recent set of regressions identified in the LUKS block driver
re-inforced that despite having a hugely useful set of I/O tests,
our CI coverage is still letting through too many bugs.

The core goals of this series were/are:

 * Add LUKS and NBD to the tested formats/protocols
   integrated into "make check-block SPEED=thorough"

 * Ensure that all qcow2 tests can be run with "SPEED=slow",
   not staying limited to only the 'auto' group used by the
   'make check-block' target in its default 'quick' mode

 * Add  'make check-block-$FORMAT' to expose a standalone
   target for running all tests for a given format (or
   equivalently a protocol)

 * Add GitLab CI jobs for exercising tests for all formats

A sample pipeline for this is

  https://gitlab.com/berrange/qemu/-/pipelines/2258731804/

Showing the 'block-FORMAT-centos' jobs which test the 10
block formats/protocols currently enabled.

This series fixes a couple of bugs

 * sendmsg generates a deprecation warning on centos

 * Test 128 check for device mapper usage doesn't work
   sufficiently well to detect gitlab's containe env
   can't do dynamic devfs

 * Test 185 is reliably failing on gitlab

I'm unclear if there are other non-deterministic failures that
would only appear if we start running the tests regularly, or
against QEMU's private runners instead of gitlab shared runners.

The ones I've fixed have been consistent across quite a few test
pipelines so far with the shared runners.

At this point it is a chicken & egg problem though.

If we don't bite the bullet and enable block I/O tests in GitLab
we'll never find out if they're stable enough to rely on.

As a mitigation against instability a patch in this series adds
a QEMU_TEST_IO_SKIP env variable that we are able to set as a
GitLab CI env variable. This lets us skip broken tests without
waiting for a git commit to disable them.

Changed in v2:

  * TL;DR: this time is actally works as described, rather
    unlike v1 which was majorly broken in its understanding
    of how mtest2make.py was working
  * Expand mtest2make.py to support a concept of an "optional"
    test suite, to create new standalone make check-xxx targets
    that don't get run by default
  * Fix sorting of Makefile.mtest to be stable
  * Fix or disable  some bugs in iotests exposed by gitlab
  * Fix the 'make check-block-$FORMAT' targets so they really
    don't get triggered by 'make chck' by default.
  * Avoid duplicating the same qcow2 tests in the 'quick'
    suite and 'slow' suite. The latter must only have the
    tests not in the 'auto' group
  * Add RST documentation of the new make targets
  * Add env variable to let us dynamically skip I/O tests
    without git commit changes
