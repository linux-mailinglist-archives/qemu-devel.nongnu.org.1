The problem is that in this community the idea of "fix" is: wait until
someone with the appropriate skill level and interest stumbles upon the
problem on their own and fix it in anger.

For it to be a proper strategy, we'd need to create an issue in gitlab
referencing the bug, have a proper reproducer and encourage contributors
to work on the issue.

Iff the above was in place, then we could disable the test. Otherwise
the test just sits there disabled. In the past there were even tests
committed that *never* ran.

The situation with multifd/cancel alone is absurd:

- It was disabled in March 2023 and stood there *not testing anything*
  while a major refactoring of the test code was happening.

- The test was fixed in June 2023, but not reenabled in fear of getting
  flak from the community for breaking CI again (or at least that's the
  feeling I got from talking to Juan).

- mapped-ram (which relies entirely on multifd) started being worked on
  and I had to enable the test in my own branch to be able to test the
  code properly. While disabled, it caught several issues in mapped-ram.

- In October 2023 the test is re-enabled an immediately exposes issues
  in the code.

This is how I started working on the migration code. Maybe you can
appreciate why I don't feel confident about this fix or disable
strategy. It has eaten many hours of my work.

Right, and is that not the same as FLAKY? What good is keeping a test in
view if the only people that can fix it are the ones that would be
seeing the breakage constantly in their own branches anyway?

Yep, we should be testing way more actually.

And still you think it's not worth it having a separate target for
testing migration. FWIW, I also proposed splittling it into multiple
meson tests, which you also rejected. It would be so much easier to move
all of this into a separate target and let those who want nothing do to
with to just ignore it.

This might be a larger issue in QEMU. I also heard the same back in 2021
when doing ppc work: "don't add too many tests because the CI buckles
and people get mad". The same with adding too much logging really. We're
hostages to the gitlab CI unfortunately.

I'll invest some time in that. I've no idea how we do unit testing in
QEMU.
