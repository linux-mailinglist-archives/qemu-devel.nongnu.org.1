Yep. It's "dumb" but very easy to access and work with.

... Also agree. Because these files avoid shared types as an explicit
design goal, and JSON Schema is *very* verbose, these files get extremely
large while saying little.

I chose them for the proof of concept because they're an existing
standard/format I didn't have to engineer or reason about heavily, and
really no other reason.

Very interesting idea, I think this could be a reasonable compromise. I'll
have to spend some time prototyping it (and digesting your other mail,
too), but tentatively, I like the idea. Thanks a lot for really digging
into both of these mails to give your feedback on this subproject.

(IOW: I think I like it, but haven't sat with it enough to really know if
there's anything it doesn't do that I need it to do. Prototyping it will
tell me. One concern I might have is that I'll need some custom code to
compare a QAPISchema object against the stored history file in order to
amend that history file. I'm not sure how complex that will be at present,
but admit my current solution is very egregious with regards to SLOC in the
git repo. And it's not as if the JSON Schema writing/reading code I
prototyped is particularly short, either.)

Interesting idea... might be a lot of files, but I suppose those don't
really *cost* anything, now do they? :)

I guess you lose out on a good summary, but a tool can just parse
qapi/history/*.txt or whatnot and concatenate the results to stdout for
you; I suppose it'd be little more than `cat qapi/history/*.txt | grep
"9\.0\.0"` or similar.

Good point. The existing diff tool I wrote was just a prototype to prove
"this sort of thing was possible", but I didn't put much thought into its
design beyond "It was quick to write as a proof of concept".

Maximizing this information's utility for use with existing utilities
without needing to maintain lots of our own script code is a great design
goal to keep in mind.

Thanks again! I'm going to re-focus on some of the more immediate changes
for the documentation project for now, but I'll no doubt be returning to
the historical parsing / since information subproject before too long --
just didn't want to sit on your email for too long so as to appear
ungrateful ;)

I'll loop you into future discussions on this subproject when I pick it
back up (Hopefully, not too far in the future.) -- and I'll make sure to
keep it on-list. Markus and I haven't gone too in-depth on this part yet,
so I figure I'll pick the prototyping back up when he's chewed through more
of my other patches and all of the Maintainers that need to care about this
are paying active attention. (Sorry for all the patches, Markus... You
asked for it!)

In my reply I had illustrated a variant of your format:<br>
<br>
=C2=A0- x-query-rdma<br>
=C2=A0-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0returns.human-readable-text: str<br>
=C2=A0. blockdev-backup<br>
=C2=A0+=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0arguments.discard-source: Optional&lt;boolean&gt=
;<br>
=C2=A0. migrate<br>
=C2=A0-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 arguments.blk: Optional&lt;boolean&gt;<br>
=C2=A0-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 arguments.inc: Optional&lt;boolean&gt;<br>
=C2=A0. object-add<br>
=C2=A0.=C2=A0 =C2=A0 arguments.qom-type: enum<br>
=C2=A0+=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 &#39;sev-snp-guest&#39;<br>
=C2=A0+=C2=A0 =C2=A0 arguments[sev-guest].legacy-vm-type: Optional&lt;boole=
an&gt;<br>
=C2=A0+=C2=A0 =C2=A0 arguments[sev-snp-guest].author-key-enabled: Optional&=
lt;boolean&gt;<br>
=C2=A0+=C2=A0 =C2=A0 arguments[sev-snp-guest].cbitpos: Optional&lt;integer&=
gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Where &#39;.&#39; is just pre-existing context, and +/- have the obvious<br=
>
meaning for the 2 given versions.<br>
<br>
What if, we append a version number to *every* line, and exclusively<br>
use +/-.<br>
<br>
Taking just one small command:<br>
<br>
=C2=A0+ 6.2.0: x-query-rdma<br>
=C2=A0+ 6.2.0:=C2=A0 =C2=A0 returns.human-readable-text: str<br>
=C2=A0- 9.1.0: x-query-rdma<br>
<br>
This tell us &#39;x-query-rdma&#39; was added in 6.2.0, the<br>
&#39;human-readable-text&#39; parameter arrived at the same<br>
time, and the whole command was then deleted in 9.1.0<br>
That has implicit property deletion, but for completeness<br>
we could be explicit about each property when deleting<br>
a command:<br>
<br>
=C2=A0+ 6.2.0: x-query-rdma<br>
=C2=A0+ 6.2.0:=C2=A0 =C2=A0 returns.human-readable-text: str<br>
=C2=A0- 9.1.0:=C2=A0 =C2=A0 returns.human-readable-text: str<br>
=C2=A0- 9.1.0: x-query-rdma<br>
<br>
Taking the more complex &#39;object-add&#39; command<br>
<br>
=C2=A0+=C2=A0 2.0.0: object-add<br>
=C2=A0+=C2=A0 2.0.0:=C2=A0 =C2=A0arguments.qom-type: enum<br>
=C2=A0+=C2=A0 2.0.0:=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&#39;....&#39;<br>
=C2=A0+ 2.11.0:=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&#39;sev-guest&#39;<br>
=C2=A0+=C2=A0 9.1.0:=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&#39;sev-snp-guest&#39;<br>
=C2=A0+ 2.11.0:=C2=A0 =C2=A0arguments[sev-guest].policy: uint32<br>
=C2=A0+ 2.11.0:=C2=A0 =C2=A0arguments[sev-guest].session-file: str<br>
=C2=A0+ 2.11.0:=C2=A0 =C2=A0arguments[sev-guest].dh-cert: str<br>
=C2=A0+=C2=A0 9.1.0:=C2=A0 =C2=A0arguments[sev-guest].legacy-vm-type: Optio=
nal&lt;boolean&gt;<br>
=C2=A0+=C2=A0 9.1.0:=C2=A0 =C2=A0arguments[sev-snp-guest].author-key-enable=
d: Optional&lt;boolean&gt;<br>
=C2=A0+=C2=A0 9.1.0:=C2=A0 =C2=A0arguments[sev-snp-guest].cbitpos: Optional=
&lt;integer&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
IOW, object-add was introduced in 2.0.0. The &#39;sev-guest&#39; enum<br>
variant was added in 2.11.0 with various fields at the same<br>
time. The &#39;sev-guest&#39; enum variant got an exctra field in 9.1.0<br>
The &#39;sev-snp-guest&#39; enum variant was added in 9.1.0 with some<br>
fields.<br>
<br>
<br>
For fields which change from Optional &lt;-&gt; Required, that could<br>
be modelled simply as parameter deletion + addition in the<br>
same version eg hypothetically lets say the &#39;sev-guest&#39; field<br>
&#39;policy&#39; had changed, we would see:<br>
<br>
=C2=A0+=C2=A0 2.0.0: object-add<br>
=C2=A0+=C2=A0 2.0.0:=C2=A0 =C2=A0arguments.qom-type: enum<br>
=C2=A0+=C2=A0 2.0.0:=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&#39;....&#39;<br>
=C2=A0+ 2.11.0:=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&#39;sev-guest&#39;<br>
=C2=A0+=C2=A0 9.1.0:=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&#39;sev-snp-guest&#39;<br>
=C2=A0+ 2.11.0:=C2=A0 =C2=A0arguments[sev-guest].policy: uint32<br>
=C2=A0-=C2=A0 6.2.0:=C2=A0 =C2=A0arguments[sev-guest].policy: uint32<br>

<br></blockquote><div><br></div><div>Very interesting idea, I think this co=
uld be a reasonable compromise. I&#39;ll have to spend some time prototypin=

. Thanks a lot for really digging into both of these mails to give your fee=
dback on this subproject.</div><div><br></div><div>(IOW: I think I like it,=
 but haven&#39;t sat with it enough to really know if there&#39;s anything =
it doesn&#39;t do that I need it to do. Prototyping it will tell me. One co=
ncern I might have is that I&#39;ll need some custom code to compare a QAPI=
Schema object against the stored history file in order to amend that histor=
y file. I&#39;m not sure how complex that will be at present, but admit my =
current solution is very egregious with regards to SLOC in the git repo. An=
d it&#39;s not as if the JSON Schema writing/reading code I prototyped is p=
articularly short, either.)<br></div><div>=C2=A0</div><blockquote class=3D"=

<br>
Incidentally, if going down this route, I think I would NOT<br>
have 1 file with the whole schema history, but have 1 file<br>
per command / event. eg qapi/history/object-add.txt,<br>
qapi/history/x-query-rdma.txt, qapi/history/VFIO_MIGRATION.txt,<br>
etc. This will make it trivial for a person to focus in on<br>
changes in the command they care about, likely without even<br>
needing a schema diff tool much of the time, as the per-command<br>
files will often be concise enough you can consider the full<br>
history without filtering.<br></blockquote><div><br></div><div>Interesting =
idea... might be a lot of files, but I suppose those don&#39;t really *cost=
* anything, now do they? :)</div><div><br></div><div>I guess you lose out o=
n a good summary, but a tool can just parse qapi/history/*.txt or whatnot a=

&gt; (3) A script that can diff two compiled schema, showing a change repor=
t<br>
&gt; between two versions. (I sent an email earlier today/yesterday showing=
<br>
&gt; example output of this script.) This one was more for &quot;fun&quot;,=
 but it helped<br>
&gt; prove all the other parts were working correctly, and it might be usef=
ul in<br>
&gt; the future when auditing changes during the RC phase. We may well deci=
de to<br>
&gt; commit this script upstream, or one like it.<br>
<br>
With a single file containing all deltas, where each line is<br>
version annotated, the &quot;diff&quot; tool becomes little more than<br>
something which can &#39;grep&#39; for lines in the file which have<br>
a version number within the desired range. In fact it can also<br>
optionally offer something better than a diff, as instead of<br>
showing you only the orignal state and result state, it<br>
can trivially shows you any intermediate changes and what<br>
version they happened with. <br>
<br>
eg if you asked for a diff between 2.0.0 and 9.1.0, and there<br>
was a command or property that was added in 4.0.0 and deleted<br>
in 6.0.0, a traditional diff will not tell you about this. You&#39;ll<br>
never notice it ever existed. <br>
<br>
A &quot;history grep&quot; showing the set of changes between 2 versions<br=
>
will highlight things that come + go, which can be quite<br>
useful for understanding API evolution I think.<br></blockquote><div><br></=
div><div>Good point. The existing diff tool I wrote was just a prototype to=
 prove &quot;this sort of thing was possible&quot;, but I didn&#39;t put mu=
ch thought into its design beyond &quot;It was quick to write as a proof of=
 concept&quot;.</div><div><br></div><div>Maximizing this information&#39;s =
utility for use with existing utilities without needing to maintain lots of=
 our own script code is a great design goal to keep in mind.<br></div><div>=
