In terms of replacing the existing audio backends, it would simply have to
wait until we declare Rust to be a mandatory dependency of QEMU, before
proposing any removal of existing backends.

GStreamer is not merely for desktop environments. It is a general purpose
audio system, and in terms of QEMU, it is already used by the Spice server
for video encoding purposes.  IMHO it is reasonable to consider whether
QEMU could use GStreamer for all audio output regardless of whether it is
running from a desktop session or not.

Personally my main concern with gstreamer is that when things go wrong
it can be very difficult to understand why and thus hard to figure out
how to fix it, unless you're pretty experienced with gstreamer.

If we do consider rationalizing how many backends we have, IMHO, it
would be desirable to retain at least one other QEMU audio backend
that is considered simple & reliable (fool proof) to use & debug.

With regards,
Daniel
