 A note about CPU models and KVM
 -------------------------------
 
 Named CPU models generally do not work with KVM.  There are a few cases
 that do work, e.g. using the named CPU model ``cortex-a57`` with KVM on a
-seattle host, but mostly if KVM is enabled the ``host`` CPU type must be
-used.  This means the guest is provided all the same CPU features as the
-host CPU type has.  And, for this reason, the ``host`` CPU type should
-enable all CPU features that the host has by default.  Indeed it's even
-a bit strange to allow disabling CPU features that the host has when using
-the ``host`` CPU type, but in the absence of CPU models it's the best we can
-do if we want to launch guests without all the host's CPU features enabled.
+seattle host, but mostly if KVM is enabled, either the ``host`` or the

+The ``custom`` CPU model generally is the better choice if you want more
+flexibility or stability across different machines or with different kernel
+versions. However, even the ``custom`` CPU model will not allow configuring
+an arbitrary set of features; the ID registers must describe a subset of the
+host's features, and all differences to the host's configuration must actually
+be supported by the kernel to be deconfigured.
 
 Enabling KVM also affects the ``query-cpu-model-expansion`` QMP command.  The
