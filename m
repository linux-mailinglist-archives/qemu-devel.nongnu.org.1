Hi Peter, and all,

Thank you all for the very helpful feedback and discussion on this 
series. I will start refactoring the code to adopt the register banking 
approach as suggested.

While working on the design, I have some questions regarding the best 
way to index these banks, especially looking ahead to RME support, and I 
would appreciate your thoughts on them.

Here is my understanding of the current situation:
According to the ARM SMMUv3 specification (IHI 0070 G.b), the SEC_SID is 
the ground truth for determining the security context of a transaction. 
For an RME-capable SMMU, its encoding is:

SEC_SID=0 <-> Non-secure
SEC_SID=1 <-> Secure
SEC_SID=2 <-> Realm
SEC_SID=3 <-> Reserved

To accurately model the SMMU, our smmuv3_translate function must 
ultimately use this SEC_SID value. Taking the translate callback 
signature into consideration:

IOMMUTLBEntry (*translate)(IOMMUMemoryRegion *iommu, hwaddr addr,
                            IOMMUAccessFlags flags, int iommu_idx);

My understanding is that we can use the iommu_idx parameter to carry the 
SEC_SID value for each transaction. The SMMU model would then use this 
index to select the correct programming interface, which in turn 
corresponds to the bank index for its internal registers (e.g., 
s->bank[iommu_idx]).

The dilemma arises when choosing the enum for this bank index. 
Philippe's suggestion to use ARMASIdx is great for the current S/NS 
case. For future RME support, one might consider ARMSecuritySpace. 
However, as Peter’s feedback highlighted, the SMMU architecture includes 
four states. The problem is that the values of ARMSecuritySpace do not 
match the SEC_SID encoding at all, so it cannot be used directly(e.g., 0 
for Secure, 1 for Non-secure BUT for SEC_SID, 0 for NON-secure, 1 for 
Secure ) .

This leads me to two questions on the best path forward:

1. How should the SEC_SID be propagated from the device? The only thing 
that is certain is that the hardware transaction will carry a SEC_SID 
value that is consistent with the manual. My initial thought was to 
extend MemTxAttrs.secure to carry the four states, but I am unsure if 
this is the best approach.

typedef struct MemTxAttrs {
     /*
      * ARM/AMBA: TrustZone Secure access
      * x86: System Management Mode access
      */
     unsigned int secure:1;
     /*
      * ARM: ArmSecuritySpace.  This partially overlaps secure, but it is
      * easier to have both fields to assist code that does not understand
      * ARMv9 RME, or no specific knowledge of ARM at all (e.g. pflash).
      */
     unsigned int space:2;

...

}


2. What should we use as the internal bank index within the SMMUv3 
model? I see two potential options:
a) Use the existing ARMSecuritySpace as the internal index. This would 
require conversions from the SEC_SID carried by each transaction.
b) Define a new, SMMU-specific enum that perfectly matches the SEC_SID 
hardware specification (e.g., enum SmmuSecSid { NS=0, S=1, REALM=2, 
ROOT=3 }). We would use this new enum as our bank index internally.

I am leaning towards option (2b) as it seems to offer better 
encapsulation and fidelity to the hardware specification, but I would be 
very grateful to hear your opinions and guidance on this architectural 
choice.

Thank you very much!

Best regards,

Tao
