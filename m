This is rather a strange idea, and feels back to front. An object's last
refcount must never be released until code has entirely finished using
the object.

This sounds like the code is missing some synchronization mechanism
beween the threads, which need to communicate with each other when
they are "done", so that the "primary" thread can then finally
release any resources.

Based on the description above it feels like the problem is outside
of QOM, around the lack of synchronization across threads.
