Haha, that was a pleasant time~

Basically correct. As I explaned in the previous email.
We cannot expect to lose migration for an extended period of time.
Even if the application's results are consistent, it cannot guarantee that
two independently running guest kernels will behave completely identically.

Yes. COLO secondary have a buffer to store the primary VMstate.
And load it when triggered the checkpoint.
