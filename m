The "while learning" part is fine at least to me.  IMHO the "ownership" to
the code, or say, taking over the responsibility, may or may not need 100%
mastering the code base first.  There should still be some fundamental
confidence to work on the code though as a starting point, then it's about
serious use case to back this up, and careful testings while getting more
familiar with it.

Yes please, it's exactly the time to share the plan.  The hope is we try to
reach a consensus before or around the middle of this release (9.1).
Normally QEMU has a 3~4 months window for each release and 9.1 schedule is
not yet out, but I think it means we make a decision before or around
middle of June.

Thanks,
