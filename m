I think that vIOMMU is niche enough that we can merely consider it
a nice-to-fix bug, and not block promoting HVF.

Not sure how best to test this, other than finding a guest OS that
exhibits this ? Others probably have better suggestions...

The only CI we have is running under Cirrus CI which uses VMs on
real mac aarch64 hardware, but I don't think we can test HVF there.

Mostly we rely on regular contributors periodically running tests
and reporting on problems. This is not ideal, but also not a blocker
for enabling HVF - it just means macOS isn't a full tier 1 platform
for us.

With regards,
Daniel
