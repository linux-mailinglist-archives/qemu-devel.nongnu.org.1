I think it'd be nice for qemu-img.c to be the canonical source
of truth, so we have the getopt short arg, long args, and
help all in the same place & thus much less likely to get
out of sync.  Thus I like the approach you've taken here
to stop using the .hx file.

As a later work, it wouldn't be too terrible to have a python
script that parses qemu-img.c to look for 'cmd_help(...)' calls
and extra the help text, which could be used to feed into the
qemu-img.rxt man page generation, thus fully eliminating the
.hx file.

This is already a massive improvement on the status quo. My
comments were mostly around whitespace/layout tweaks to the
help output.
