I haven't seen that patch, but I presume it's not relevant?

Are you referring to measured direct boot?  In that case, there's no
point having hashes in the fw_cfg, because OVMF in the guest needs to
hash the kernel itself and then compare to a trusted source (which the
fw_cfg file wouldn't be because it's under the control of the
hypervisor).  For SEV, the trusted source is a table in the launch
measured ROM, but I'm sure TDX does something similar.

Well, no, since firmware tends to update on a longer timeframe than the
kernel and the cmdline and initrd tend to have quicker update cycles
than the kernel.  Thus there's no one golden reference.  Instead you
give a tool (say the virtee sev_snp_measure tool

https://github.com/virtee/sev-snp-measure

) the hashes of the firmware, kernel, command line and initrd and it
caclulates the expected launch measure

That's because it's a pre-launch measure.  The TCG log is only for post
launch.  The idea being those values are needed for you to approve
something in pre-launch, like key release, before the TPM starts
running.

That's not to say we shouldn't have log entries for pre-launch, but
that's a generic problem and not specific to measured direct boot.

This sounds like a first measurement thing.  In many ways, the pre-
launch measurement is equivalent to the SRTM of a physical system which
is collected in the EV_S_CRTM_* events.  But for that to happen, I
think the TCG would have to bless it in some form.
