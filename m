Thanks for the link. I now understand that you are talking about a field 
to indicate the supported access width. I think Radim's comments
illustrate that software should not have to worry about about 32-bit or
64-bit accesses as the CBQRI spec requires a controller to support both.
I think we will have to wait and see if there are any real hardware
implementations where that is not the case.

I don't think the kernel patches for RQSC will be that complicated to
rebase. However, I think the Qemu branch [1] will take more work as it
was based on an old PPTT patch series [2]. I think I will have the
Ssqosid+CBQRI kernel patch series ready to post tomorrow, so I think it
is reasonable to target posting the rebased RQSC series for Linux and
Qemu 1 week later.

Thanks,
Drew
