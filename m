We already have a whole chunk of gdb tests under check-tcg. Maybe it
would be easier just to re-write the tests to use the check-tcg system
tests rather than jumping through hoops to fit in with the
check-functional requirements.

The only downside is that we miss out on having async device events as
the check-tcg tests are super simple. But the record/replay tests should
pick up on sync errors so perhaps its orthogonal to defending the
reverse-step/continue functionality?

My concern is it probably isn't quite that simple - and we have just
invented YAGMI (Yet Another GDB Machine Interface) module. The fact that
we have no widely packaged python gdb interface is probably a testament
to the edge cases that exist.
