This series is an attempt to fix a deadlock issue reported by Andrey
here [0].

bdrv_drained_begin() polls and is not allowed to be called with the
block graph lock held. Mark the function as GRAPH_UNLOCKED.

This does not catch the issue reported by Andrey, because there
is a bdrv_graph_rdunlock_main_loop() before bdrv_drained_begin() in
the function bdrv_change_aio_context(). That unlock is of course
ineffective if the exclusive lock is held, but it seems to prevent TSA
from finding the issue.

Thus the bdrv_drained_begin() call from inside
bdrv_change_aio_context() needs to be moved up the call stack before
acquiring the locks. This required the most changes, patch 09/11.

Granular draining is not trivially possible, because many of the
affected functions can recursively call themselves.

In place where bdrv_drained_begin() calls were removed, assertions
are added, checking the quiesced_counter to ensure that the nodes
already got drained further up in the call stack.

In bdrv_graph_wrlock() there is a comment that it uses
bdrv_drain_all_begin_nopoll() to make sure that constantly arriving
new I/O doesn't cause starvation. The changes from this series are at
odds with that, but there doesn't seem to be any (new) test failures.

I did not CC the maintainers for blkverify, vmdk, etc. because this is
just an RFC and the changes there are mechanical, for adapting some
callers of block layer functions.
