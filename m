Ah I missed that too when I quickly went over the old series, sorry.

I think what Dan meant was that we'd better do that with the handshake
work, which should cover more than this.  I've no problem with that.

It's just that sooner or later, we should provide something more solid than
commit 6720c2b327 ("migration: check magic value for deciding the mapping
of channels").

When I mentioned posting it separately, it'll still not be relevant to the
VFIO series. IOW, I think below is definitely not needed (and I think we're
on the same page now to reuse multifd threads as generic channels, so
there's no issue now):

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/027695db92ace07d2d6ee66da05f8e85959fd46a.1713269378.git.maciej.szmigiero@oracle.com/

So I assume we should leave that for later for whoever refactors the
handshake process.

Thanks,
