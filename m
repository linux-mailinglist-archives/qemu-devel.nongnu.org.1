But our test makefiles could equally well just run "cp" !
swtpm has no privilege here that we do not already have.

Anyway, the thing here is that we run swtpm like this:

 swtpm socket -d  --tpm2 --tpmstate dir=/path/to/somewhere --ctrl
type=unixio,path=/path/to/socket

where we use command line arguments to tell it where to
put the tpmstate and the socket.

Either:
 (1) there are places where it's not valid for us to tell swtpm to
put the tpmstate or to put the control socket
 (2) it's valid to put those anywhere we like

If (1), then swtpm should give a clear error message that we've
given it an invalid argument (and its manpage should say what
the restrictions are)
If (2), then apparmor should not be rejecting this usage

One of swtpm or apparmor must be wrong here and I think it should
be fixed. In particular, having the failure mode be "something
goes wrong after swtpm has successfully started and only once
it gets sent the TPM_INIT command, and the information about it
only winds up in the syslog" is pretty awkward -- it would
be much nicer if it failed fast, as soon as you ran it, and
printed the error to stderr.

In the interim, since we'd like to be able to run the test suite
on Ubuntu, it sounds like we can work around this by putting
the tpmstate and socket in either /tmp/ or somewhere under
the user's home directory.

thanks
