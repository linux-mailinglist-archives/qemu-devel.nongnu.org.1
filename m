I think simpler is more readable so not having an or-irq object where not 
needed as the PCI code can handle this makes it more readable (also the 
same as ppc440_pcix which was previously approved by Peter[1] and a patch 
to add or-irq there was dropped as unneeded[2] so doing the same thing the 
same way here is also more readable and more consistent). Thus I think the 
interrupt routing changes should be OK and having an or-irq is an 
unneeded complication.

What other readablility concerns do you have? Is it about not passing the 
whole device state struct to callbacks but only what they need from it? 
I've answered that already and I think that unnecessary casts would not 
add any readablility. I'd like to hear others' opinion too but it seems 
not many care so it's only us and we both seem to have strong view on 
these things so it's hard to come to an agreement.
