Right, because ignore_shared implies putting the MR address in the
stream, but there is still the matter of whether the pages will actually
be read on the destination.

Should ram_save_setup() use RAMBLOCK_FOREACH_NOT_IGNORED instead of
RAMBLOCK_FOREACH_MIGRATABLE? I don't immediately see why not...

Thanks, Peter. A keen eye, as usual. I was searching for this reasoning
when looking at the code, but it missed me.

I looked back at the very first version of fixed-ram, which wasn't
authored by me and there is indeed no mention or expectation of handling
shared ram. So I think this is at this point unspecified.

What is the current impact of having those pages in? We're "just"
wasting cycles writing to the file, AFAICS. We'd better, at least,
sanitise that part to avoid the extra work.

I agree with all you say below, but I think an earlier question would
be: why put the address on the stream in the first place? Is this just
hardening of some sort?

The commit the introduces the feature has me wondering:

fbd162e629 ("migration: Add an ability to ignore shared RAM blocks")

  during save:
  
  +        if (migrate_ignore_shared()) {
  +            qemu_put_be64(f, block->mr->addr);
  +            qemu_put_byte(f, ramblock_is_ignored(block) ? 1 : 0);
  +        }

  during load:
  +    if (ramblock_is_ignored(block)) {
           error_report("block %s should not be migrated !", id);
           return NULL;
       }

If we know it's ignored, why send anything at all? (also, "to ignore"
has a meaning, we should stick to it)

Looking at the initial commit, I think this is all sanity check, maybe
to ensure some sort of stream compatibility. Or to make sure the stream
is stateful and we're not confusing an ignored block with an
(incorrectly) ignored one.

I believe it's ok to remove the check. I wish we had a compatible way to
remove handling of ignored blocks altogether, but I guess this u64 is
now on the stream forever?
