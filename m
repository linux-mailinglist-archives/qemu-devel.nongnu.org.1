Hi Mrkus,

I'm really sorry I completely missed your reply (and your patient
advice). It wasn't until I looked back at the lore archives that I
realized my mistake. Thinking it over again, I see that your reply,
which I missed, really helped clear up my confusion:

I misunderstood your point. The PMU stuff and the QAPI definitions for
ObjectType/ObjectOptions are not related. They should belong to separate
categories or sections.

Thank you for your patience. I have revisited and carefully considered
the "QEMU QMP Reference Manual," especially from a reader's perspective.
Indeed, I agree that, as you mentioned, a three-level directory
(accelerator - kvm - kvm stuff) is more readable and easier to maintain.

For this question "what we want *first*, and only then how to get it", I
think my thought is:

First, the structure should be considered, and then the specific content
can be added. Once the structure is clearly defined, categorizing items
into their appropriate places becomes a natural process...

Then for this question "what section structure would make the most sense
for the QMP reference manual?", I understand that a top-down, clearly
defined hierarchical directory makes the most sense, allowing readers to
follow the structure to find what they want. Directly adding
kvm-pmu-filter.json or kvm.json would disrupt the entire structure, because
KVM is just one of the accelerators supported by QEMU. Using "accelerator"
as the entry point for the documentation, similar to the "accel" directory
in QEMU's source code, would make indexing more convenient.

Thank you very much!!

Based on your inspiration, I think the ideal section structure for my
issue could be:

    = accelerator
    == KVM
    === PMU

Firstly, I should have a new accelerator.json () to include KVM stuff:

    ##
    # = Accelerator
    ##

    { 'include': 'kvm.json' }

Next, in kvm.json, I could organize stuffs like:

    ##
    # == KVM
    ##

    ##
    # === PMU stuff
    ##

    ... (the below are my current QPAI definitions.)

Is such a structure reasonable?

Thank you again for your guidance!

Regards,
Zhao
