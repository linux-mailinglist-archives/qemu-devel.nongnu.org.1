In general, yes, we do care.

In this specific case though, we're battling to figure out the lesser
of multiple evils.

Right now we configure with:

  --target-list=x86_64-softmmu --without-default-devices 

and so with optimization enabled, we'll get good warning coverage of
a small amount of code, except we don't because people started
ignoring the msys jobs as they timeout too frequently.

If we can use Thomas' clang switch or my -O0 patches, we can get
within the timeout, so people can trust the job once again. If we
can do both ideas and cut the time even more, then we can enable
more features (perhaps drop --without-default-devices).

So the warnings might not be quite as good, but we'll have the
warnings across a larger amount of code.

Alot of the warnings from the Linux/macOS builds will also apply
in the Windows builds. I think on balance I'd probably prefer us
to build a larger amount of code for Windows. This is in context
of free shared runners at least.

As a more drastic option, we might need to consider using the
Azure credits for Windows  runners too. If we could have bigger
VMs for Windows CI, we can build more and have better warnings
at the same time. 

With regards,
Daniel
