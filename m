I realized there's no need for QemuMutex binding, since we can use Rust
native Mutex directly, except some case which will share the Mutex with
C side.

Just about the name:

`to_migration_state` and `restore_migrated_state*` sound not a proper pair.
What about `snapshoot_migration_state` and `restore_migration_state`?

I think maybe here it's also necessary to accept a `&mut self` since
device would make some changes in pre_save.

Then this trate can provide mutable methods and ToMigrationStateShare
provides immuatable ones.

BTW, if possible, maybe we can rename the traits like:
* ToMigrationState -> ToMigrationStateMut
* ToMigrationStateShared -> ToMigrationState

I'm considerring maybe we could use get_mut() (and check bql by
assert!(bql_locked())) instead of locking this Mutex.

In this context, C side should hold the BQL lock so that this is
already a stronger protection.

This omits the restore_migrated_state_mut, I guess it should be
filled with `unimplemented!()`.

And here, maybe `get_mut()` + `assert!(bql_locked())`?

Yes, this is a nice way to handle Rust wrappers.

Maybe performance is a thing, and it might be worth comparing the
impact of these additional callbacks.

Overall, the design looks great!
