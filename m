[MCA: Since v1 I've received a few reports of FIFO assert()s being triggered and a
cmdfifo buffer overflow discovered by fuzzing the updated ESP code. The updating of
all FIFO push/pop operations to use the esp_fifo_*() functions in this series
provides protection against this, and in conjunction with new patches 9-11 is
enough to prevent all qtest reproducers that I have been sent.

For these reasons I would recommend that this series be applied for 9.0. Many thanks
to Chuhong Yuan <hslester96@gmail.com> for reporting the issues and providing qtest
reproducers.]

The ESP device has a DRQ (DMA request) signal that is used to handle flow control
during DMA transfers. At the moment the DRQ signal is explicitly raised and
lowered at various points in the ESP state machine as required, rather than
implementing the logic described in the datasheet:

"DREQ will remain true as long as either the FIFO contains at least one word (or
one byte if 8-bit mode) to send to memory during DMA read, or has room for one more
word (or byte if 8-bit mode) in the FIFO during DMA write."

This series updates the ESP device to use the same logic as described above which
also fixes a couple of outstanding GitLab issues related to recovery handling
during FIFO overflow on 68k Macs using PDMA.

Patches 1-4 update existing users of esp_fifo_pop_buf() and esp_fifo_pop() with
the internal cmdfifo to use the underlying Fifo8 device directly. The aim is
to ensure that all the esp_fifo_*() functions only operate on the ESP's hardware
FIFO.

Patches 5-6 update esp_fifo_push() and esp_fifo_pop() to take ESPState directly
as a parameter to prevent any usage that doesn't reference the ESP hardware
FIFO.

Patch 7 ensures that any usage of fifo8_push() for the ESP hardware FIFO is
updated to use esp_fifo_push() instead.

Patch 8 updates esp_fifo_pop_buf() to take ESPState directly as a parameter
to prevent any usage that doesn't reference the ESP hardware FIFO.

Patch 9 introduces the esp_fifo_push_buf() function for pushing multiple bytes
to the ESP hardware FIFO, and updates callers to use it accordingly.

Patches 10-12 incorporate additional protection to prevent FIFO assert()s and a
cmdfifo buffer overflow discovered via fuzzing.

Patch 13 is just code movement which avoids the use of a forward declaration whilst
also making it easier to locate the mapping between ESP SCSI phases and their
names.

Patches 14 introduce a new esp_update_drq() function that implements the above
DRQ logic which is called by both esp_fifo_{push,pop}_buf().

Patch 15 updates esp_fifo_push() and esp_fifo_pop() to use the new esp_update_drq()
function. At this point all reads/writes to the ESP FIFO use the esp_fifo_*()
functions and will set DRQ correctly.

Patch 16 is a small update to the logic in esp_pdma_write() to ensure that
esp_fifo_push() is always called for PDMA writes to the FIFO, thereby ensuring
that esp_update_drq() remains correct even in the case of FIFO overflow.

Finally patch 17 removes all manual calls to esp_raise_drq() and esp_lower_drq()
since the DRQ signal is now updated correctly upon each FIFO read/write access.

v3:
- Rebase onto master
- Add patch 1 to move the internals of esp_fifo_pop_buf() to a new
  esp_fifo8_pop_buf() function. This allows the FIFO wrap logic to still be
  used for managing cmdfifo
- Rework esp_cdb_length() into esp_cdb_ready() as suggested by Paolo in patch
  11
- Update the logic in patch 12 to use the new esp_cdb_ready() function

v2:
- Rebase onto master
- Add patches 9-12 to handle FIFO assert()s and cmdfifo overflow as reported by
  Chuhong Yuan <hslester96@gmail.com>
