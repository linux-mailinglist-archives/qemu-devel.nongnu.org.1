The kernel doesn't have a standalone copy of the text, it is just
inline in the middle of their huge SubmittingPatches document.
We don't want to mislead people into thinking we're following
the kernel's patch submision rules in general, instead define
our own clear policy. 


> It's slightly different from kernel, with copyright and prohibition to change it.

That difference is not of any consequence. The probhition
aganist changing makes sense, to protect the value of the
"Developer Certificate of Origin" term to have a fixed
meaning.

The 4 clauses that you must certify against are all identical
to the kernel's copy, which is what matters.

Yes, we should clarify our intent in this respect, per the other
part of this thread around what we interpret "real name" to
mean for QEMU.

I should have preserved this phrase in the new doc.
