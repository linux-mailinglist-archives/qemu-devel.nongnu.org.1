It seems that OP-TEE is a term used generically to represent any firmware running in secure mode, but it's a *totally* different software than TF-A + RMM. Naming OP-TEE like this is like if Linux would have been named "OP-kernel".

Yes, correct. The term is TEE, OP-TEE is the project you mentioned. For 
some reason, everybody seems to think that OP-TEE is *the* unique TEE 
implementation is Arm world.
Thus my analogy with Linux that would be named OP-Kernel.

Yes, that's utterly confusing and took me quite some time to discover it, after talking with Mathieu himself. They removed it explicitely to make the stack more simple. In short, for Realms, forget about OP-TEE.

I'm not sure what is happening. I gave it a try now (from a clean repo), 
and it works as expected. I had weird errors when stopping sync with 
ctrl-c in the past too. Anyway, clean and retry.

Maybe you built previously master branch, then switched to rme and 
rebuilt. In this case, your kernel and tf-a are not updated. I added a 
note in README, there is no dependency check when switching branches, 
you're expected to run git clean by yourself.
Both shrinkwrap and OP-TEE build don't really handle that properly to be 
honest...

It's not ideal, but I don't want to go down the rabbit hole of 
reimplementing any kind of half baked Make based dependency graph.
Maybe we could use git submodules or repo in the future, but both have 
their own drawbacks too.
