We will accept an extension when it is ratified. The question here is,
what if two ratified extensions conflict?

The answer to me seems that we need to support both them. *Maybe* at
some point in the future we can then drop the debug extension. That
would require the Sdtrig extension to be widely used and debug not
used (which is why I brought up shipping hardware).
