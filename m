Looking at it, it simply delivers more timer ticks at a faster rate when 
they were missed in some cases (like when guest is paused). It's quite 
different from altering time for the guest only.

The 'sleep' approach mentioned is used in plugin ips, but it has some 
caveats, as explained. In this case, we just can slow down execution by 
blocking cpu run from various plugin hooks. There is no simple solution 
to accelerate it.
