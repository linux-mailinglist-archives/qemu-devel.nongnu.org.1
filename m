Depends on how the guest is using the TSC, but yes.

Well, if invtsc is exposed to the guest, then it might use the TSC for
timekeeping purposes. 

Therefore you don't want to fail (on the invtsc clock characteristics)
otherwise timekeeping in the guest might be problematic.

But this are all just heuristics. 

Do you have a suggestion for different behaviour?
