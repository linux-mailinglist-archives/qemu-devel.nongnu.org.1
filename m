I think we will still need the QOM tree in that case. I think the 
platform information will look somewhat similar to VMState, which 
requires the QOM tree to interpret.

I suggest disabling all offload features of virtio-net with 9.2.

I want to keep things consistent so I want to disable all at once. This 
change will be very uncomfortable for us, who are implementing offload 
features, but I hope it will motivate us to implement a proper solution.

That said, it will be surely a breaking change so we should wait for 9.1 
before making such a change.

By the way, I am wondering perhaps the "no-cross-migrate" scenario can 
be implemented relatively easy in a way similar to compatibility 
properties. The idea is to add the "no-cross-migrate" property to 
machines. If the property is set to "on", all offload features of 
virtio-net will be set to "auto". virtio-net will then probe the offload 
features and enable available offloading features.
