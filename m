I mean the pin can't be done at the time of char device open, where the 
user address space is not known/bound yet. The earliest point possible 
for pinning would be until the vhost_attach_mm() call from SET_OWNER is 
done. Actually I think the counterpart vhost_detach_mm() only gets 
handled in vhost_vdpa_release() at device close time is a resulting 
artifact and amiss of today's vhost protocol - the opposite RESET_OWNER 
call is not made mandatory hence only seen implemented in vhost-net 
device today. One qemu instance could well exec(3) another new qemu 
instance to live upgrade itself while keeping all emulated devices and 
guest alive. The current vhost design simply prohibits this from happening.

It's kernel decision for sure. I am with this part.

To better facilitate QEMU exec (live update) case, I propose we add new 
vhost uAPI pair for explicit pinning request - which would live with 
user mm's, or more precisely qemu instance's lifecycle.

I think the iotlb layer in vhost-vdpa just provides the abstraction for 
mapping, not pinning. Although in some case mapping implicitly relies on 
pinning for DMA purpose, it doesn't have to tie to that in uAPI 
semantics. We can do explicit on-demand pinning for cases for e.g. 
warming up device at live migration destination.

You can disregard this for now. I will discuss that further with you 
guys while bind_mm and per-group use_va stuffs are landed.

Thanks!
