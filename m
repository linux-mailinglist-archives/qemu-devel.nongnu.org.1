Yeah I understand such option would only provide more options.

However as long as such option got introduced, user will start to do their
own "optimizations" on how to provision the multifd channels, and IMHO
it'll be great if we as developer can be crystal clear on why it needs to
be introduced in the first place, rather than making all channels open to
all purposes.

So I don't think I'm strongly against such parameter, but I want to double
check we really understand what's behind this to justify such parameter.
Meanwhile I'd be always be pretty caucious on introducing any migration
parameters, due to the compatibility nightmares.  The less parameter the
better..

Do you think it'll be worthwhile give it a shot, even if we can't decide
yet on the order of end()s to be called?

It'll be great if we could look into these issues instead of workarounds,
and figure out what affected the performance behind, and also whether that
can be fixed without such parameter.
