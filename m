True, that is just user error though.  They could disable a profile
and then manually re-enable individual features, and thus get a
working system.

I'd probably just call that user error too.

Real hardware is constrained in not being able to invent arbitrary
new features on chip. Virtual machines  are not constrained, so
I don't think the inability of hardware todo this, is an especially
strong reason to limit software emulation.

What I don't like about this, is that (IIUC) the '$profile=on' option
now has different semantics depending on what CPU it is used with.

ie  using it with a vendor CPU,   $profile=on  becomes an assertion
that the vendor CPU contains all the features needed to satisfy
$profile. It won't enable/disable anything, just check it is present.

With a non-vendor CPU, using $profile=on becomes a mechanism to force
enable all the features needed to satisfy $profile, there is no
mechanism to just check for presence.

Having two different semantics for the same syntax is generally considered
bad design practice.

This points towards supporting a tri-state, not boolean. $profile=check
for validation only, and $profile=on for force enablement.


With regards,
Daniel
