Correct the proposal. It should be QEMU treats them as what KVM reports.

TDX module reports these #VE reduction related CPUIDs as configurable 
because it allows VMM to paravirt them. If KVM doesn't support the 
paravirt of them, KVM can clear them from configurable bits and add them 
to fixed0 bits when KVM reports to userspace.

To some degree, I think it matters. As I explained above, if KVM reports 
it as configurable to userspace, it mean TDX module allows it to be 
configured and KVM allows it to be paravirtualized as well. So userspace 
can configure it as 1 when users wants it. This is how VMM is going to 
present the feature to TD guest.

However, how TD guest is going to use it depends on itself.
1) when TD guest doesn't enable #VE reduction: the configuration from 
VMM doesn't matter. The CPUIDs are fixed1 and related operation leads to 
#VE.

2) When TD guest enables #VE reduction and doesn't enable 
TDCS.FEATURE_PARAVIRT_CTRL of the related bit: the configuration from 
VMM doesn't matter. The CPUIDs are fixed0 and related operation leads to 
#GP.

3) When TD guest enables #VE reduction and enable 
TDCS.FEATURE_PARAVIRT_CTRL of the related bit: the configuration from 
VMM matters.
   - When VMM configures the bits to 1, the related operation leads to 
#VE (for paravirtualization).
   - When VMM configures the bits to 0, the related operation leads to #GP.

So for case 3), it does matters.

yes, I agree on it.

I agree.

With the proposed fixed/fixed1 information, and in addition to the 
configurable bits, KVM can fully validate the TDX module against its 
capabilities. When violation occurs (e.g., some KVM unsupported bit 
being reported as fixed1 by TDX module), KVM can just refuse to enable TDX.
