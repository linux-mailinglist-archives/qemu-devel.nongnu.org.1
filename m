The subject of the cover letter "fix memory region 
use-after-finalization" is confusing. While this series has such fixes, 
it also contain refactoring patches. The cover letter says:

 > Patch "qdev: Automatically delete memory subregions" and the
 > succeeding patches are for refactoring, but patch "vfio-user: Do not
 > delete the subregion" does fix use-after-finalization.

More concretely, patch "qdev: Automatically delete memory subregions" 
implements a common pattern of device unrealization, and the suceeding 
patches remove ad-hoc implementations of it.

And since patch "hw/pci-bridge: Do not assume immediate MemoryRegion 
finalization" fixes nothing as you pointed out, only patch "vfio-user: 
Do not delete the subregion" fixes something.

Without patch "vfio-user: Do not delete the subregion", 
vfio_user_msix_teardown() calls memory_region_del_subregion(). However, 
this function is called from instance_finalize, so the subregion is 
already finalized and results in a use-after-finalization scenario.

Anything else is for refactoring and it's quite unlike patch "memory: 
Fix leaks due to owner-shared MRs circular references", which is a bug fix.

I think I'll drop patch "hw/pci-bridge: Do not assume immediate 
MemoryRegion finalization" and rename this series simply to "qdev: 
Automatically delete memory subregions" to avoid confusion.

Patch "qdev: Automatically delete memory subregions" and the succeeding 
patches are for refactoring of qdev. MRs not directly owned by qdev are 
out of scope of the change.
