First is incorrect. Both commands simply call job_user_pause_locked() function.

I think, that block-job-pause documentation is older than JOB_STATUS_CHANGE event.

Comment is correct.. But it applies only to block-jobs. I can add it to job-resume,
like

    # This command also clears the error status of block jobs

Actually, only mirror job supports this command. So yes, we can copy the comment
to job-complete as well.

Yes, relying on 2.12 version in modern documentation is awkward. I'll touch this up somehow.

Seems not.

Hmm probably, if we have a transaction of several jobs (actually only backups may be joined to transactions), where some have auto-finalize and some not, the whole transaction would be pending, including jobs that has auto-finalize=true. Still, it's a strange case.

Hmm.. You mean, deprecated "true" value, and finally drop the fields, making "false" the default? May be.


I'll resend, with additional patch to touch-up the documentation.
