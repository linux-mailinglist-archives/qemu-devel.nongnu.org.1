Agree, postcopy ought to deserve more attention as respect to refining the
huge
VM migration.

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Currently, the convergence algorithm determines that the mig=
ration<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; cannot converge according to the following principle:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The dirty pages generated in current iteration exceed a spec=
ific<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; percentage (throttle-trigger-threshold, 50 by default) of th=
e number<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of transmissions. Let&#39;s refer to this criteria as the &q=
uot;dirty rate&quot;.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If this criteria is met more than or equal to twice<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (dirty_rate_high_cnt &gt;=3D 2), the throttle percentage inc=
reased.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; In most cases, above implementation is appropriate. However,=
 for a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; VM with high memory overload, each iteration is time-consumi=
ng.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The VM&#39;s computing performance may be throttled at a hig=
h percentage<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and last for a long time due to the repeated confirmation be=
havior.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Which may be intolerable for some computationally sensitive =
software<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the VM.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; As the comment mentioned in the migration_trigger_throttle f=
unction,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in order to avoid erroneous detection, the original algorith=
m confirms<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the criteria repeatedly. Put differently, the criteria does =
not need<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to be validated again once the detection is more reliable.<b=
r>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; In the refinement, in order to make the detection more accur=
ate, we<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; introduce another criteria, called the &quot;dirty ratio&quo=
t; to determine<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the migration convergence. The &quot;dirty ratio&quot; is th=
e ratio of<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bytes_xfer_period and bytes_dirty_period. When the algorithm=
<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; repeatedly detects that the &quot;dirty ratio&quot; of curre=
nt sync is lower<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; than the previous, the algorithm determines that the migrati=
on cannot<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; converge. For the &quot;dirty rate&quot; and &quot;dirty rat=
io&quot;, if one of the two<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; criteria is met, the penalty percentage would be increased. =
This<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; makes CPU throttle more responsively and therefor saves the =
time of<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the entire iteration and therefore reduces the time of VM pe=
rformance<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; degradation.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; In conclusion, this refinement significantly reduces the pro=
cessing<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; time required for the throttle percentage step to its maximu=
m while<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the VM is under a high memory load.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m a bit lost on why this patch 2-3 is still needed if patch=
 1 works.<br>
&gt; &gt; Wouldn&#39;t that greatly increase the chance of throttle code be=
