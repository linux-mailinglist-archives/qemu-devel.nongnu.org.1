Migration module was there for 10+ years.  Initially, it was in most cases
based on coroutines.  As more features were added into the framework, like
postcopy, multifd, etc.. it became a mixture of threads and coroutines.

I'm guessing coroutines just can't fix all issues that migration want to
resolve.

After all these years, migration is now heavily based on a threaded model.

Now there's still a major part of migration framework that is still not
thread-based, which is precopy load.  We do load in a separate thread in
postcopy since the 1st day postcopy was introduced, however that requires a
separate state transition from precopy loading all devices first, which
still happens in the main thread of a coroutine.

This patch tries to move the migration incoming side to be run inside a
separate thread (mig/dst/main) just like the src (mig/src/main).  The
entrance to be migration_incoming_thread().

Quite a few things are needed to make it fly..  One note here is we need to
change all these things in one patch to not break anything.  The other way
to do this is add code to make all paths (that this patch touched) be ready
for either coroutine or thread.  That may cause confusions in another way.
So reviewers, please take my sincere apology on the hardness of reviewing
this patch: it covers a few modules at the same time, and with some risky
changes.

BQL Analysis
============

Firstly, when moving it over to the thread, it means the thread cannot take
BQL during the whole process of loading anymore, because otherwise it can
block main thread from using the BQL for all kinds of other concurrent
tasks (for example, processing QMP / HMP commands).

Here the first question to ask is: what needs BQL during precopy load, and
what doesn't?

Most of the load process shouldn't need BQL, especially when it's about
RAM.  After all, RAM is still the major chunk of data to move for a live
migration process.  VFIO started to change that, though, but still, VFIO is
per-device so that shouldn't need BQL either in most cases.

Generic device loads will need BQL, likely not when receiving VMSDs, but
when applying them.  One example is any post_load() could potentially
inject memory regions causing memory transactions to happen.  That'll need
to update the global address spaces, hence requires BQL.  The other one is
CPU sync operations, even if the sync alone may not need BQL (which is
still to be further justified), run_on_cpu() will need it.

For that, qemu_loadvm_state() and qemu_loadvm_state_main() functions need
to now take a "bql_held" parameter saying whether bql is held.  We could
use things like BQL_LOCK_GUARD(), but this patch goes with explicit
lockings rather than relying on bql_locked TLS variable.  In case of
migration, we always know whether BQL is held in different context as long
as we can still pass that information downwards.

COLO
====

COLO assumed the dest VM load happens in a coroutine.  After this patch,
it's not anymore.  Change that by invoking colo_incoming_co() directly from
the migration_incoming_thread().

The name (colo_incoming_co()) isn't proper anymore.  Change it to
colo_incoming_wait(), removing the coroutine annotation alongside.

Remove all the bql_lock() implications in COLO, e.g., colo_incoming_co()
used to release the lock for a short period while join().  Now it's not
needed.  Instead, taking BQL but only when needed (colo_release_ram_cache).

At the meantime, there's colo_incoming_co variable that used to store the
COLO incoming coroutine, only to be kicked off when a secondary failover
happens.

To recap, what should happen for such failover should be (taking example of
a QMP command x-colo-lost-heartbeat triggering on dest QEMU):

  - The QMP command will kick off both the coroutine and the COLO
    thread (colo_process_incoming_thread()), with something like:

    /* Notify COLO incoming thread that failover work is finished */
    qemu_event_set(&mis->colo_incoming_event);

    qemu_coroutine_enter(mis->colo_incoming_co);

  - The coroutine, which yielded itself before, now resumes after enter(),
    then it'll wait for the join():

    mis->colo_incoming_co = qemu_coroutine_self();
    qemu_coroutine_yield();
    mis->colo_incoming_co = NULL;

    /* Wait checkpoint incoming thread exit before free resource */
    qemu_thread_join(&th);

Here, when switching to a thread model, it should be fine removing
colo_incoming_co variable completely, because if so, the incoming thread
will (instead of yielding the coroutine) wait at qemu_thread_join() until
the colo thread completes execution (after receiving colo_incoming_event).

RDMA
====

With the prior patch making sure io_watch won't block for RDMA iochannels,
RDMA threads should only block at its io_readv/io_writev functions.  When a
disconnection is detected (as in rdma_cm_poll_handler()), the update to
"errored" field will be immediately reflected in the migration incoming
thread.  Hence the coroutine for RDMA is not needed anymore to kick the
thread out.

When the thread is available, we also can't have rdma_cm_poll_handler()
keep polling the fd and operate on it in the main thread.  Drop it
completely, and it should be fine because qemu_rdma_wait_comp_channel()
should also be monitoring it.

This almost reverts commit 923709896b1b01fb982c93492ad01b233e6b6023.

We need to do this change in this same patch that we introduce the thread,
unfortunately, otherwise we can have a risk of racing.

TODO
====

Currently the BQL is taken during loading of a START|FULL section.  When
the IO hangs (e.g. network issue) during this process, it could potentially
block others like the monitor servers.  One solution is breaking BQL to
smaller granule and leave IOs to be always BQL-free.  That'll need more
justifications.

For example, there are at least four things that need some closer
attention:

  - SaveVMHandlers's load_state(): this likely DO NOT need BQL, but we need
  to justify all of them (not to mention, some of them look like prone to
  be rewritten as VMSDs..)

  - VMSD's pre_load(): in most cases, this DO NOT really need BQL, but
  sometimes maybe it will!  Double checking on this will be needed.

  - VMSD's post_load(): in many cases, this DO need BQL, for example on
  address space operations.  Likely we should just take it for any
  post_load().

  - VMSD field's get(): this is tricky!  It could internally be anything
  even if it was only a field.  E.g. there can be users to use a SINGLE
  field to load a whole VMSD, which can further introduce more
  possibilities.

In general, QEMUFile IOs should not need BQL, that is when receiving the
VMSD data and waiting for e.g. the socket buffer to get refilled.  But
that's the easy part.
