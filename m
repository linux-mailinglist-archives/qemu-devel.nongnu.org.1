True.  But will readers understand what "CPR" stands for?  Do they need
to understand?

Now I'm confused.

Earlier, you explained why we can't simply send CPR state via the normal
migration channel: we create devices and backends much earlier long
before we receive from the migration channel.  Correct?

Here, you're documenting that the CPR channel can only be specified on
the command line, not with migrate-incoming.  Isn't that a different
problem?

A second opinion from a native speaker would be nice.

Yes, consistency is desirable.

Thanks!
