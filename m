I think we can assume /all/ future CPUs are conceptially in scope
for this.

The use case is to allow guest owners to monitor the power consumption
of their workloads, so they can take steps to optimize their guest VM
workloads to reduce power consumed.

Is the MSR based interface likely to be removed in future silicon,
or it will be remain for back compat ?
