Right.

Got it.

I agree this is a digression, so feel free to ignore the remainder of my
reply for now.

We have two kinds of flags in the QAPI schema language: features and ad
hoc flags.  The ad hoc flags are 'boxed' (commands and events), 'gen',
'success-response', 'allow-oob', 'allow-preconfig', 'coroutine'
(commands only).

The flags sort into three buckets:

1. Code generation directives that do not affect the external interface,
and thus should not be visible in introspection: 'boxed', 'gen',
'coroutine'.

2. Flags that are visible at the external interface, but don't affect
code generation beyond making them visible in introspection: the
non-special features.

3. Code generation directives that affect the external interface, and
thus are (or should be) visible in introspection.

3a. The special features: are visible.

3b. 'allow-oob': is visible, but differently, because it predates
special features.

3c. 'allow-preconfig': not visible.

3d. 'success-response': not visible, because we use it for QGA only,
which doesn't provide introspection.

Bucket 3 could use cleanup.
