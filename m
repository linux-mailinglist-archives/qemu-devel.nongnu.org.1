Hi Davidlohr,

Happy new year.

Hmm. Could have sworn I pushed i out... Guess messed that up :(

Note there is a stray change in there for an unrelated tests
tree that I've tidied up in my local tree.

I'll push a new tree out next week but assuming this series
isn't otherwise messed up by me, I'd like to email this out as
something I think is ready to merge before I do that. 

If you spot anything bad with this I might shuffle things around
to put the physical port commands set ahead of it.

Jonathan
