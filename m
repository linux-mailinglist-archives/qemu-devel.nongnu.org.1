Well if 'easy' is our goal, then we can just copy the gdbmi.py
file from avocado into our test suite. It didn't originate in
avocado to begin with, they copied it from its orignal repo
to then port it to py3. The only real downside with gdbmi is
that the machine level protocol is ugly to read, but I'll take
that over this current patch, as I think the reverse debugging
stuff is a match for the functional test suite, and moving to
the tcg tests still leaves us with the unpleasant interaction
and debugging issue that I've described - they're just hidden
from the functional test suite, but still impacting QEMU as a
whole.

I agree it isn't simple if the TCG tests are in scope, but from the POV
to the reverse debugging functional test it looks simple.
