I also started working on this, see
https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/pull/5715 .
I was working towards SPDM communication over DOE as well.

Unfortunately it stalled with the EDK2 review process being so incredibly s=
low

No worries, there were no mistakes made. I was just pointing out that
we have had this discussion before and settled on an external SPDM
implementation.

That doesn't mean we can't change that in the future, but I think it
needs a good justification and like Daniel says at least a partial
implementation to go with it
