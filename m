Can we document the required format here explicitly, rather than expecting
users to go searching for specs which are often practically impossible
to find, and even harder to read & interpret ?

This locking scheme is likely unsafe. Consider this sequence

  * QEMU runs qemu_open(path)
  * External mgmt app runs unlink(path)
  * External mgmt app runs open(path)
  * External mgmt app runs lock(fd)
  * QEMU runs qemu_lock_fd(fd)

QEMU has successfully acquired a lock on an FD that corresponds to a
deleted file, not the current existing file.

Avoiding this problem requires either that the external mgmt app agrees
to *NEVER* unlink() the files under any circumstance, or for QEMU to
run its open + lock logic in a loop, checking 'stat' and 'fstat' before
opening and after locking, in order to detect a replaced file from its
changed inode.

I'm not inclined to rely on mgmt apps never unlink()ing as that's to
easy to mess up IMHO.

With regards,
Daniel
