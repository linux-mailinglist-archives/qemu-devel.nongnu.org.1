Right - it was disabled right from the beginning.
As I reported libvirt detected it as not available and constructed the
CPU as with it disabled.
Which translated it into -cpu ...,pdcm=3Doff,...

The new and bad aspect we need to overcome is that in these conditions
this now somehow breaks save/restore and migration operations.

As a cross-check I reverted just and only 00268e0002 on top of
10.1-rc2 and these use cases work again.
