I've got html and text working, text wasn't hard. I will give it a good
college try on the LaTeX and man formats. Might be easy. The issue here is
the custom node I introduced for the collapsible details sections which has
no default handler in the generators. I'll have to learn more about that
part of the API, I haven't interfaced with it much yet.

Sure. I... just need to figure out which commit to mention it in. Added to
my list, anyway.

Got it. Possibly a "for later" task but not much later. It can always come
after this first series, but before we "turn on" the new generator, if that
makes sense. Just so we reach a quiescent point and flush the staggeringly
large queue.

I guess what I mean is: "Let's make sure what I've got here so far is good
first, and then I'll start adding stuff."

I suppose it's just internal details that I like to know, but tend to find
the HTML reference easier to work with than grepping through the qapi
files. I'm gonna change it for you anyway because I agree it's not
consistent with the philosophy of "end user QMP reference". Just feels like
a tiny shame somehow.

So ... structs, unions, alternates all condensed down to "Object", is that
right? We get to keep command/enum/event separate, I assume.

I should also point out, this is an issue in the domain and not the
generator; the generated rst document doesn't have this duplication. So
it's kind of a no-op while we look and consider this specific series, but
it's still on my list when we go to look at the predecessor series.

&gt;&gt;<br>

&gt; Known issue. The reason is because we do not mandate a source document=
ation<br>
&gt; format for errors - by convention, it is a list. There is (or was?) on=
e<br>
&gt; occurrence where it wasn&#39;t a list and I wrote a patch to change th=
at. I<br>
&gt; don&#39;t recall right now if we merged that or not. The misalignment =
is a<br>
&gt; result of nesting a list inside of a list.<br>
<br>
Commit b32a6b62a82 (qapi: nail down convention that Errors sections are<br>
lists)<br>
<br>
&gt; If we *mandate* the source format, I gain the ability to &quot;peel of=
f the<br>
&gt; nesting&quot;, which will fix the alignment.<br>
<br>
