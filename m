I understand Alex and you intend to help QEMU users, but sometimes a 
change to help QEMU users is better to be done in the upstream of its 
dependency.

For example, when I submitted a patch to suppress a sanitizer warning in 
the past, I was asked if it may be better to propose a change of the 
sanitizer behavior instead of changing QEMU code. We eventually 
concluded we should change our code at that time, but it could have 
turned out otherwise. It is no different from the normal review process; 
a submitter proposes a solution, a reviewer suggests alternatives, and 
both figure out the optimal one in the discussion.

I appreciate your contribution to the documentation too. Once there was 
no documentation, but Gurchetan Singh added one along with their 
Rutabaga patches. With your change, the documentation will be 
comprehensive also for virglrenderer.
