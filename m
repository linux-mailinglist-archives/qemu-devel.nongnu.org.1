I think for cases where the doc block is short and we have a desire to
merge "returns" and "intro", the intro makes the most sense if there isn't
anything of particular value assigned to the return value to begin with.

So, more or less, yeah: if semantics are partially duplicated between
intro/returns, I'm in favor of putting it all in the intro and allowing
transmogrifier generate the return type info.

I don't think there's a good case to make for a doc block with no intro but
a healthy paragraph in the returns section, that looks goofy.

Of course: I think there are still circumstances where we'll want both the
intro and the returns info explicitly labeled, when we have some
information to document about the semantics of that return value.

There&#39;s overlap between query-FOO&#39;s intro and Returns.=C2=A0 The in=

talk about the same thing, namely the value returned.<br>
<br>
Why two prose descriptions of the value returned?=C2=A0 Wouldn&#39;t one be=

better?<br>
<br>
Let&#39;s try.=C2=A0 We need to choose where to put it, intro or Returns.<b=

<br>
When Returns comes right after intro, putting it into Returns can work<br>
fine, because the command&#39;s purpose still comes first.=C2=A0 For instan=
