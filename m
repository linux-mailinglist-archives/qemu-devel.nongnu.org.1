You made me think.

On the one hand, you are right, I agree with all arguments about migration
being separate from virtio device types, their backends and frontends.

And yes, if refuse the idea of enabling the feature in old machine types
automatically, everything fits into existing paradigm.

On the other hand is our downstream practice in the cloud. We introduce
new machine types _very_ seldom. Almost always, new features developed
or backported to our downstream doesn't require new machine type. In such
situation, creating feature, which theoretically (and more simple in API!)
may be done without introducing new MT, but creating it by introducing new
MT, postponing the moment when we start to widely use it up to the moment when
most of existing vms will die or restart naturally (as for sure, we'll not
ask users to restart them, it would be too expensive (not saying about,
is restart a safe way to change MT, or we'd better recreate a vm), seems
very strange for me. (too long sentence detector blinking).

So, finally, it's OK for me to switch to per-device properties. Then, in
downstream I may implement corresponding capabilities to simplify management.
That's rather simple.

-

Interesting, could migration "return path" be somehow used to get information
from target, does it support backend transfer for concrete device?

So that, we simply enable backend-transfer=true parameter both on
source and target. Than, source somehow find out through return path,
for the device, does target support backend-transfer for it, and decide,
what to do? Or that's too complicated?
