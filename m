Turning a feature with a platform dependency to "on" implies that
the machine type will cease to work out of the box for platforms
which lack the feature. IMHO that's not acceptable behaviour for
any of our supported platforms.

IOW, "after a few QEMU releases" implies a delay of as much as
5 years, while we wait for platforms which don't support the
feature to drop out of our supported targets list.  I don't
think that'll satisfy the desire to get the new feature
available to users as soon as practical for their particular
platform.

Our supported platform list determines when this will be, and given
our current criteria, this can be as long as 5 years.
