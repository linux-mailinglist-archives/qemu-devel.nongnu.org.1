But it's most likely found as dependency in apps that already use other 
libraries from the same family that usually come with a certain desktop 
environment. Also spice does not want to replace all the other display 
backends or SDL does not replace other sound backends so the same way it's 
fine to add a GStreamer as another optional way to output sound but not as 
replacing the existing backends and sound infrastructure in QEMU.

That probably means we should retain at least the lowest level output for 
the native sound systems of the OSes where QEMU runs but then we can also 
have other backends as the main complexity is in the audio infrastructure 
and not in the backends. What may be possible is to drop OSS and the 
mixing support that is mainly needed for OSS arguing that ALSA has 
replaced OSS on Linux and sndio replaced it on BSD and these can already 
do resampling and mixing themselves so this could simplify QEMU audio code 
to just pass data to a sound service but I'm not sure this feature isn't 
used by some people in QEMU with other backends or to record to wav for 
example. If we remove that too saying that recording can be done from the 
system native sound service then maybe no need for resampling and mixing 
in QEMU at least for output. But what about input where both the system 
and the emulated cards are limited to some specific samping rates and they 
are not set to use the same? Or do the sound services take care of that 
too and you can ask for arbitrary input rate and will it convert from 
hardware rate or you get back an error and QEMU has to handle this?
