Perhaps migration thread itself can also be a candidate, then.

The update of COMPLETED status can be a good place of a marker point to
show such flush done if from the gut feeling of a user POV.  If that makes
sense, maybe we can do that sync before setting COMPLETED.

No matter which thread does that sync, it's still a pity that it'll go into
UNINTERRUPTIBLE during fdatasync(), then whoever wants to e.g. attach a gdb
onto it to have a look will also hang.
