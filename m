Whether we have our AI policy or not, contributors are still required
to abide by the terms of the DCO, which requires them to understand
the legal situation of any contribution.

Our policy is effectively saying that most use of AI is such that we
don't think it is possible for contributions to claim DCO compliance.

If we think there are situations where it might be credible for a
contributor to claim DCO compliance, we can try to find a way to
describe that situation, without having to explicitly state our
legal interpretation of the "copyrightable vs non-copyrightable"
boundary.


At KVM Forum what was notably raised as the topic fo code
refactoring and whether it is practical to allow some such
usage.


We have historically allowed machine refactoring done by Coccinelle
for example. Someone could asks an AI agent to write a Coccinelle
script for a given task, and then tells the AI to run that script
across the code base. I think that might be a situation where it
would be reasonable to accept the AI driven refactoring, as the
substance of the comit is clearly defined by the Coccinelle
script.

Could that be summarized by saying that we'll allow refactoring
if driven via an intermediate script ? That is still quite a
strict definition that could frustrate much usage, but it at
least feels like something that should have greatl]y reduced
risk compared to direct refactoring by an opaque agent.


As an example though, we have the scripts/clean-includes.pl script
that Markus wrote for manipulating code into our preferred style
for headers.

Whether the headers change is done manually by a human, automated
with Markus' perl script or automated by an AI agent, the end
result should be identical, as there is only one possible end
point and you can describe what that end point should look like.

That said there is  still a questionmark over complexity. Getting
to the end point may be a trival & mundane exercise in some cases,
while requiring considerable intellectual thought in other cases.
The latter is perhaps especially true if wanting simple, easily
bisected series of small steps rather than a big bang conversion.

With regards,
Daniel
