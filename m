hmm that's unfortunate. The size retrieval in these cases might have to do with
missing information from the image header, and we can't control that because we're
not generating the images. It would be better if they return '0' in these cases
(then we could special case them in the math), but if it's a non-zero return then
there's not much we can do.

If we can't reliably get the kernel size in RAM then I believe your patch is going
to make it do (until we want to load an even bigger kernel hehe). Can you please
document these findings (i.e. we can't retrieve the kernel size reliably) in the
commit msg?


Thanks,

Daniel
