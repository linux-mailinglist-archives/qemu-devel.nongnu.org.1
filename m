Yes, that would be nice :)

Unfortunately, this does not work on its own. Among others, iotest 096
for qcow2 will hang, because bdrv_img_create() is called by
external_snapshot_action() while drained and then qcow2_co_create()
coroutine will hang in
blk_co_do_pwritev_part()/blk_wait_while_drained(). So it seems having
the more targeted drain here is important.

Would it be sensible to go with the "temporarily unlock" solution, but
adding an extra check that the root bs of the device is still the one we
drained after re-locking? And returning an error if not. At least for
now, because the series is already getting quite big (in particular with
the split of 09/11).

Best Regards,
Fiona
