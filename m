You can use lorelei, i.e.:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/?q=dfn:/docs/+AND+-s:PULL

See how to integrate with your client workflow:
https://people.kernel.org/monsieuricon/lore-lei-part-1-getting-started#maildir-or-imap

Ditto i.e.:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/?q=dfn:/docs/+AND+-s:PULL+AND+-dfn:/docs/devel
