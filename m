Not sure why it wouldn't show up -- this is the main hypervisor
trap configuration register, and it's always been HCR for AArch32
and HCR_EL2 for AArch64.

I tried to lay this out in the commit message, but basically what
we have is that this trap bit is trapping a set of the ID registers.
In v7A it was specified to trap the ID registers that were defined
at that time, but not the encodings that were reserved in the
ID register space. (As ID register space, 'reserved' means RAZ,
not UNDEF as it would elsewhere in the system register space.)
In v8A some new ID registers were defined in what was previously
the reserved space, and so v8A says that TID3 must trap those also
(and that it IMPDEF is allowed to trap the rest of the reserved space).
Finally, FEAT_FGT fixes up the unhelpful IMPDEF variability by mandating
trapping on the whole space, reserved or not.

(Before v7A HCR didn't exist at all and these ID registers never
trap anywhere: since HCR.TID3 in our implementation will always
be 0 on CPUs without EL2, we don't need to special case "doesn't
actually have Hyp mode" in the access functions.)

We have two different things we want to do:

(1) always trap if TID3 is set
(2) trap if we are v8 or better and TID3 is set

We want to use function 1 for the set of ID registers that
existed back in v7A -- these are the ones that trap for any
implementation.
We want function 2 for the ID registers that were only defined
in v8A, and for the reserved-ID-register space. These must not
trap on v7A, and either must or are IMPDEF-permitted to trap
on v8A and later.

I have tried to pick function names that make sense for "what
is this doing", and for "if somebody adds a new register here,
make the function they want be the one with a name that seems
most inviting, so they pick the right one, not the wrong one".
So I have access_v7_tid3 for ID registers defined in
v7, and access_tid3 for the rest, including any new ones.
This seemed to me better than picking a function name that
describes the internal implementation of functions 1 and 2,
on the basis that people are a lot more likely to need to
use the functions than look inside them.

If you have suggested names that you think make more sense,
I'm open to them -- since I started by knowing the behaviour
to me the names I ended up with seem more "obvious" to me than
they would to somebody else, and it's the "somebody else" that
I'm trying to help with the naming...

Separately, the implementation of function (2) in this patch
is "if ARM_FEATURE_V8 is set, call function (1) to do the test-TID3,
otherwise return ACCESS_OK to indicate don't-trap". (Inherited
from the existing implementation choice.)

Given that function (1) is only a simple test of
"((arm_current_el(env) < 2) && (arm_hcr_el2_eff(env) & HCR_TID3))"
we could alternatively open-code that check in function (2)
if you think that would be clearer.

thanks
