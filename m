I've finished my review pass. Overall I think the API is fine but I
would like the arch maintainers to be happy the individual hooks capture
the right semantics for their arches.

I think Pierrick has already picked up some compile failures, you can
see more from my gitlab CI run:

  https://gitlab.com/stsquad/qemu/-/pipelines/1618014020

As you have discovered with the discontinuity issue making sure the
execution state is consistent with JIT'ed code has a few landmines in
it. Given it is hard to trigger with our basic softmmu tests you should
consider a few more aggressive tests like:

  tests/functional/test_aarch64_tcg_plugins.py

where we can pick exactly which plugin we want to use and run something
that will have a lot of IRQs and exceptions in it. It doesn't have to be
Aarch64 - whichever arch you are most familiar with. A test that
includes a hypervisor would be ideal as that will trigger a wider range
of execution state changes.
