I am aware of that distinction. I dealt with it with patch "virtio-gpu:

I am not sure what you refer to with cross-device MR links so can you 
clarify it?

I referred to the following statement you made by saying we don't have 
to object_unparent(mr->container):

I discussed calling del_subregion() is still problematic below.
