Sorry, I don't follow. Why would a new field be needed in RQSC?

Yes, I have working on the assumption that the number of MCIDs (RMIDs)
will be greater than, or equal to, the number of RCIDs (e.g. CLOSIDs).

Chapter 6 of the CBQRI spec states that: "In a typical implementation,
the number of RCID bits implemented (for example, to support 10s of
RCIDs) might be smaller than the number of MCID bits implemented (for
example, to support 100s of MCIDs)."

I would be very interested if anyone can share the RCID and MCID count
for their CBQRI hardware implementation.

The series I am about to post for Ssqosid+CBQRI [1] just contains a
device tree example, but I will do a followup series for RQSC. The
kernel branch [2] from the RQSC proof-of-concept was based on v6.14 so I
need to rebase it. The good thing is that 6.19 now has the PPTT helpers
from the MPAM driver series.

Thanks,
Drew
