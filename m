if accel=auto, if smmu is attached to a bus where only emulated devices
are plugged, at cold start accel=false and then it effectively becomes
impossible to hotplug a vfio device.
if accel=auto and smmu is attached to a bus where a VFIO-PCI device is
cold-plugged, we end up with accel=on forced.
otherwise you always have the possible to opt-on for accel with accel=true
just like intel_iommu has caching_mode option.

tbh I did not understand why this explicit setting was needed and why it
can't be inferred from the HostIOMMUDevice. But I need to read this back.

Maybe we shall not focus too much on auto detection at the moment.
