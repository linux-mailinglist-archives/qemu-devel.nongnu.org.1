BTW, I don't mean this to be a criticism of Debian. We've seen
the same kind of instability with all the other non-released distros
(Fedora Rawhide, OpenSUSE Tumbleweed and Alpine Edge) in libvirt CI,
such that we've finally set all of them non-gating across all our CI
deployments.

They're all good to have in CI as a smoke test to identify possible
problems coming towards you in the next stable release, but false
failures have to be expected.

With regards,
Daniel
