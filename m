IMHO we should rather aim to eliminate contrib. We should either care
about the contents, and find an appropriate home for it in tree & have
ability to install it, or they should live outside QEMU git in their
own home.

We shouldn't encourage a "dumping ground" for stuff that we don't
know what to do with.

If tox is outside, that seems to require that we re-run configure for
each different python version we want to run tests with, which feels
pretty undesirable.

There's the (system) python version that we want to run the overall
build system with, and then there are N other python versions which
we want to be able to run linters against.
