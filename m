Sure, it can't be enforced automatically as you mentioned.

As you said, some maintainers may test some tier 3 platforms as part of 
their personal "check" routine, and in this case, they are allowed to 
ask to the developer to fix it, which your documentation mentions 
already. So far, so good.

However, this comes with the question of providing the developer a way 
to access those environments, as not everyone has an arm64 machine or a 
macos machine. And it's not far to ask people to fix something they 
don't have access to.

Thus the second point in my email, how to provide this?

I respect your position and your dedication to using OSS. To a broader 
extent, I respect your view on what is acceptable or not for the project.

I *NEVER* mentioned I wanted to change anything to QEMU project whether 
it's relocating its source code, bug tracker, or even its CI. 
Personnally, I really like GitLab features and UI, much more than GitHub.

The goal is not to force anyone or QEMU to use GitHub, but to provide a 
free and open source solution to anyone who might want/need to access 
such machines. Nothing more.

It's simply because GitHub offers unlimited minutes for any public 
project. To give you a concrete number, in 2025, testing all qemu 
series, it used 50'000$ of CI minutes for... free. Personally, I think 
that's a good deal, and the best solution on the (free) market today.
Every maintainer can see in seconds if any series builds, passes tests, 
or checkpatch, without wasting their personal "minutes". I started this 
for learning QEMU testing and for my personal usage, and realized it can 
be useful for maintainers also.

QEMU project uses runners from Digital Ocean, which we use only because 
we have free credits there. It's as closed as AWS, GCP or Azure. GitHub 
runners use Azure, and their VM images are fully open source by the way:

Finally, I would like to make an analogy, that may help to understand my 
pragmatic position on all this.

 From your professional email signature, I already had the pleasure to 
visit your personal gallery and enjoy your photos, a hobby you and I 
have in common.
Have you been comfortable with using a Nikon camera that has a closed 
source firmware? I guess yes, because the edit and production chain you 
use are. Well, it's the same here. QEMU is built and produced with a 
chain we control, and that is OSS.
Where we run our tests or play with it, well, it does not really matter 
and does not impact a single bit of our digital destiny.

Now, I invite you again to take 1 minute of your time, visit this link 
and read the README: https://github.com/second-reality/github-runners
You'll see there is nothing to be scared about, just a simple way to 
access various machines for free.

Pierrick
