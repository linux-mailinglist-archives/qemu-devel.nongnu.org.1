These align closely with the data that comes from the fabric management
API in the CXL spec.  So I don't see a big maintenance burden problem
in having these as stable interfaces.  Whilst they aren't doing quite
the same job as the FM-API (which will be emulated such that it is
visible to the guest as that aids some other types of testing) that
interface defines the limits on what we can tell the device to do.

So yes, risk for these is minimal and I'm happy to accept that.
It'll be a while before we need libvirt to use them but I do
expect to see that happen. (subject to some guessing on a future
virtualization stack!)
