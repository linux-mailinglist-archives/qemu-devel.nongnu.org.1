Absolutely.  There is a bunch of stuff that we reject today but
the interfaces allow you to specify it and align with the CXL specification
Fabric Management API definition which is the spec used to control this
stuff from a BMC etc.  If that doesn't work we have a hardware errata
problem, so hopefully that is fairly stable.

I think I can publicly confirm there are some related errata in flight,
seeing as we said we'd raise questions on some aspects in the kernel and
QEMU series preceding this one (so no IP secrecy issues). These are as a
result of this work from Fan, but we have carefully avoided implementing
anything that 'may' change.

Ok. If it makes sense to make this unstable for now I'm fine with that.
I don't see why it would change beyond in backwards compatible fashion
with new optional fields to cover future specification updates allowing
for more information. However I've been wrong on such things before.

So I'm fine adding a patch on top of v8 marking them unstable for now.

There is a need for completion information but given it's completely
asynchronous to the commands defined here (Can be out of order, lots of
ongoing capacity add / remove flows in flight etc) and for the hardware
definition the feedback occurs via an event record log I'm not expecting it
to affect the interfaces added so far.

I'll take a look, but these are not conventional background commands
(We do have those as well, but that's a whole different set of future
problems!)

The actual command itself completes synchronously but not the flow
it kicked off which is not background as such because it may never
finish and involves lots of moving parts.  This is similar to any
form of error injection.  We inject the error synchronously and that
creates a bunch of records in various registers / firmware etc but
the actions the host OS takes are asynchronous and may only happen
when it decides to poll some register or a driver loads much later.

So I'm not sure if job.json approach fits.
