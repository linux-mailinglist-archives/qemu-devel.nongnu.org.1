I disagree, sanity checking hardware and firmware is a good thing.  E.g. se=
e KVM's
VMCS checks, the sanity checks for features SEV depends on, etc.

That said, I'm not terribly concerned about more features that are uncondit=
ionally
exposed to the guest, because that will cause problems for other reasons, i=
.e.
Intel should already be heavily incentivized to not do silly things.

The only CPUID bits that truly matter are those that are associated with ha=
rdware
features the TDX module allows the guest to use directly.  And for those, K=
VM
*must* know if they are fixed0 (inverted polarity only?), fixed1, or config=
urable.
As Adrian asserted, there probably aren't many of them.

For all other CPUID bits, what the TDX Module thinks and/or presents to the=
 guest
is completely irrelevant, at least as far as KVM cares, and to some extent =
as far
as QEMU cares.  This includes the TDX Module's FEATURE_PARAVIRT_CTRL, which=
 frankly
is asinine and should be ignored.  IMO, the TDX Module spec is entirely off=
 the
mark in its assessment of paravirtualization.  Injecting a #VE instead of a=
 #GP
isn't "paravirtualization".
=20
Take TSC_DEADLINE as an example.  "Disabling" the feature from the guest's =
side
simply means that WRMSR #GPs instead of #VEs.  *Nothing* has changed from K=
VM's
perspective.  If the guest makes a TDVMCALL to write IA32_TSC_DEADLINE, KVM=
 has
no idea if the guest has opted in/out of #VE vs #GP.  And IMO, a sane guest=
 will
never take a #VE or #GP if it wants to use TSC_DEADLINE; the kernel should =
instead
make a direct TDVMCALL and save itself a pointless exception.

  Enabling Guest TDs are not allowed to access the IA32_TSC_DEADLINE MSR di=
rectly.
  Virtualization of IA32_TSC_DEADLINE depends on the virtual value of
  CPUID(1).ECX[24] bit (TSC Deadline). The host VMM may configure (as an in=
put to
  TDH.MNG.INIT) virtual CPUID(1).ECX[24] to be a constant 0 or allow it to =
be 1
  if the CPU=E2=80=99s native value is 1.

  If the TDX module supports #VE reduction, as enumerated by TDX_FEATURES0.=
VE_REDUCTION
  (bit 30), and the guest TD has set TD_CTLS.REDUCE_VE to 1, it may control=
 the
  value of virtual CPUID(1).ECX[24] by writing TDCS.FEATURE_PARAVIRT_CTRL.T=
SC_DEADLINE.=20

  =E2=80=A2 If the virtual value of CPUID(1).ECX[24] is 0, IA32_TSC_DEADLIN=
E is virtualized
    as non-existent. WRMSR or RDMSR attempts result in a #GP(0).

  =E2=80=A2 If the virtual value of CPUID(1).ECX[24] is 1, WRMSR or RDMSR a=
ttempts result
    in a #VE(CONFIG_PARAVIRT). This enables the TD=E2=80=99s #VE handler.

Ditto for TME, MKTME.

FEATURE_PARAVIRT_CTRL.MCA is even weirder, but I still don't see any reason=
 for
KVM or QEMU to care if it's fixed or configurable.  There's some crazy logi=
c for
whether or not CR4.MCE can be cleared, but the host can't see guest CR4, an=
d so
once again, the TDX Module's view of MCA is irrelevant when it comes to han=
dling
TDVMCALL for the machine check MSRs.

So I think this again purely comes to back to KVM correctness and safety.  =
More
specifically, the TDX Module needs to report features that are unconditiona=
lly
enabled or disabled and can't be emulated by KVM.  For everything else, I d=
on't
see any reason to care what the TDX module does.

I'm pretty sure that gives us a way forward.  If there only a handful of fe=
atures
that are unconditionally exposed to the guest, then KVM forces those featur=
es in
cpu_caps[*].  I.e. treat them kinda like XSAVES on AMD, where KVM assumes t=
he
guest can use XSAVES if it's supported in hardware and XSAVE is exposed to =
the
guest, because AMD didn't provide an interception knob for XSAVES.

If the list is "too" long (sujbective) for KVM to hardcode, then we revisit=
 and
get the TDX module to provide a list.

This probably doesn't solve Xiaoyao's UX problem in QEMU, but I think it gi=
ves
us a sane approach for KVM.
