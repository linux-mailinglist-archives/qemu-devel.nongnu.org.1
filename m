It might be worth it to quote spec definitions of IOVA, GPA, SPA.

IOVA: I/O Virtual Address: Virtual address for DMA by devices
GPA: Guest Physical Address: An address in the virtualized physical
memory space of a virtual machine.
SPA: Supervisor Physical Address: Physical address used to access
memory and memory-mapped resources.

From IOMMU specification it's pretty clear, an untranslated address is
always an IOVA.

If you look at the introduction section and section 2.3. "Process to
translate an IOVA", translation (if enabled by the device/process
context) to GPA, SPA is expressed as:

step #17: GPA =3D FSC[IOVA]
step #19: SPA =3D IOHGATP[GPA]

With that, MSI address translations always use GPA as an input
(section 2.3.3. "Process to translate addresses of MSIs"), and is done
as step #18 of the IOVA translation.

And now:
If FSC.Mode =3D=3D Bare, step #17 translation is simple GPA =3D IOVA
If IOHGATP.Mode =3D=3D Bare, step #19 translation is simple SPA =3D GPA

If both FSC and IOHGATP modes are bare, no address translation is
performed, and SPA =3D GPA =3D IOVA. However if "MSI page tables are
enabled, then the MSI address translation process specified in Section
2.3.3 is invoked".  This was the reason to put the
riscv_iommu_msi_check() function before check for pass-through mode
check.

If FSC.Mode =3D=3D Bare and untranslated address given to the function
riscv_iommu_spa_fetch() is an GPA =3D IOVA. It could also be SPA if
IOHGATP.Mode =3D=3D Bare, but it is irrelevant for the MSI address
translation.  That is the reason to put only the check for !en_s in
before riscv_iommu_msi_check() call.

I'm aware that VFIO uses S-Stage translation only, but it does not
change the hardware logic. For such cases VFIO can provide IMSIC
register mappings in S-Stage PT to emulate MSI doorbell registers (if
needed). When S-Stage translation is used, an untranslated address
processed by the IOMMU hardware is still an IOVA, even if the guest OS
/ VFIO user treats it as PA.

Modification of the check to include en_g ( !(en_s && en_g) && ,,, )
will incorrectly enable MSI address translation for an IOVA address
(as defined in IOMMU spec) if G-Stage translation is set to Bare mode.

I'd suggest to keep the s/g stage checks here as:
      if ((iotlb->perm & IOMMU_WO) && !en_s &&
          riscv_iommu_msi_check(s, ctx, iotlb->iova)) {
          ...
      }

Hope that helps this discussion.
