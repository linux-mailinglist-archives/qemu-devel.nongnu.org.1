I don't know anything about this but have you tried comparing 'info mtree' 
output from QEMU Monitor to see what changed? That may show if some memory 
block moved or overlaps something now.

The SH in QEMU is not much maintained and maybe there aren't many people 
to look at it so don't expect much help with it.
