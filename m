Right, these days I think /tmp usually is not tmpfs but just a regular
filesystem. For these tests that's okay though. And it gets us working
with gitlab CI. The ignore-shared test works and is verified to skip the
copy (according to counters and some tracing I did) so I think it's a
good step.

Ah okay userfault. I guess that would require real tmpfs. We could just
add a new option to the harness for require_uffd when it comes up?

I think that's good if you _need_ shm (e.g., for a uffd test), but
we should permit tests that only require a memory file.

Thanks,
Nick
