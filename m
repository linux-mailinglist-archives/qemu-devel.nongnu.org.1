In principle I agree. I am not enthusiastic either. There are however two
problems in the current policy.

First, the policy is based on a honor code; in some cases the use of AI can
be easily spotted, but in general it's anything but trivial especially in
capable hands where, for example, code is generated by AI but commit
messages are not. As such, the policy cannot prevent inclusion of AI
generated code, it only tells you who is to blame.

Second, for this specific kind of change it is, pretty much, impossible to
tell whether it's generated with AI or by a specialized tool or by hand. If
you provide a way for people to be honest about their tool usage, and allow
it at least in some cases, there's a nonzero chance they will be; if you
just tell them a hard no, and lying by omission has more than plausible
deniability, there's a relatively high chance that they will just stay
silent on the matter while still using the tool.

In other words, as much as I would also like a simple policy, I expect
fewer undiscovered violations with the exception in place=E2=80=94even beyo=
nd what
the exception allows. And given the stated goal of using proposals and
actual usage to inform future policy, this approach could serve that goal
better than plain prohibition.

That said, I am okay with having no exception if that's the consensus.

Thanks,

Paolo
