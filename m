Oppps, sorry, should have cross-linked to:

ctime of libvirt itself and ctime of QEMU binary are the two
primary factors.

We had to throw in other factors on top for various edge cases
over time. So we also check the mtime of the directory containing
QEMU loadable modules, as features reported can vary if the user
installs new device/backend modules. Also check kernel version,
microcode version, CPUID signature, because that can affect
availability of some features.

NB, this is caching more than just the QMP schema - we issue
many 'query-xxxx' commands when probing QEMU.

I don't recall that discussion, but I would think the problem is
that we probe much more than just QMP schema. Actually thinking
about it, the fact that we probe more than just QMP schema means
my idea of probing once and getting the answer for all targets
may not be practical. Some of the query-xxx  commands we run will
likely need to know the target.

Daniel
