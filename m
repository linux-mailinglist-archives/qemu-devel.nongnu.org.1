> Looks like a hack. So we have bdrv_co_is_zero_fast() which do pass want_zero=false to block-status. But in case of mirror, which want to check the whole disk, we actually want want_zero=true, and detect it by offset=0..

Mirror case differs from usage in qcow2 exactly by the fact that we call it only once.

Which is exactly why I wrote patch 4/6 turning the want_zero bool into
an enum so that we are being more explicit in WHY block status is
being requested.

I'm not worried about one or even two lseek on the destination; what
I'm trying to avoid is an lseek on the destination for every chunk
where the source is doing a write-zeroes request (we're already doing
an lseek on the source as part of the background task of the mirror,
but foreground writes being split into the original and the mirror are
where it really matters that we aren't going slower just because of
the mirror).
