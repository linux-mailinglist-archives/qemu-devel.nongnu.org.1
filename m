FWIW, there was a third possible option here, a sort of hybrid...

   prompt> run the tool <blah> on the QEMU code, run mypy tests and

that would probably have saved the hours learning how to use RightTyper
making it more competitive with the pure AI approach.

AFAICS the diff there is either whitespace changes, or a differing
style for  importing a module vs importing a name from a module.

Whitespace we should be enforcing with 'black' formatting rules.
For import style, I'd say that's an irrelevant difference.

IOW, I'd call the two patches identical for any practical purposes.

With regards,
Daniel
