I hope so too, though some of the sphinx version compatibility hacks are
possibly fairly porcelain. The most egregious of them are for versions
prior to Sphinx 4.1.

Almost all of the compatibility hacks are factored into compat.py and they
are all documented with what versions they're there for. Most of the
ugliest is pre-4.1.

Missing documentation for undocumented members. You found one! :)

It's the stuff in compat.py that was the absolute hardest. You need that
stuff for this to work on the version ranges it works for, but typing it
was an extra special torture.
