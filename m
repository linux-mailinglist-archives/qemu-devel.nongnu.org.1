Hello,

* This series (v7) adds 'MULTIFD_RECV_SYNC' migration command. It is used
  to notify the destination migration thread to synchronise with the Multifd
  threads. This allows Multifd ('mig/dst/recv_x') threads on the destination
  to receive all their data, before they are shutdown.

  This series also updates the channel discovery function and qtests as
  suggested in the previous review comments.

===


v6: https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20250215123119.814345-1-ppandit@redhat.com/T/#t
* This series (v6) shuts down Multifd threads before starting Postcopy
  migration. It helps to avoid an issue of multifd pages arriving late
  at the destination during Postcopy phase and corrupting the vCPU
  state. It also reorders the qtest patches and does some refactoring
  changes as suggested in previous review.

v5: https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20250205122712.229151-1-ppandit@redhat.com/T/#t
* This series (v5) consolidates migration capabilities setting in one
  'set_migration_capabilities()' function, thus simplifying test sources.
  It passes all migration tests.

v4: https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20250127120823.144949-1-ppandit@redhat.com/T/#t
* This series (v4) adds more 'multifd+postcopy' qtests which test
  Precopy migration with 'postcopy-ram' attribute set. And run
  Postcopy migrations with 'multifd' channels enabled.

v3: https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20250121131032.1611245-1-ppandit@redhat.com/T/#t
* This series (v3) passes all existing 'tests/qtest/migration/*' tests
  and adds a new one to enable multifd channels with postcopy migration.


v2: https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20241129122256.96778-1-ppandit@redhat.com/T/#u
* This series (v2) further refactors the 'ram_save_target_page'
  function to make it independent of the multifd & postcopy change.


v1: https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20241126115748.118683-1-ppandit@redhat.com/T/#u
* This series removes magic value (4-bytes) introduced in the
  previous series for the Postcopy channel.


v0: https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20241029150908.1136894-1-ppandit@redhat.com/T/#u
* Currently Multifd and Postcopy migration can not be used together.
  QEMU shows "Postcopy is not yet compatible with multifd" message.

  When migrating guests with large (100's GB) RAM, Multifd threads
  help to accelerate migration, but inability to use it with the
  Postcopy mode delays guest start up on the destination side.

* This patch series allows to enable both Multifd and Postcopy
  migration together. Precopy and Multifd threads work during
  the initial guest (RAM) transfer. When migration moves to the
  Postcopy phase, Multifd threads are restrained and the Postcopy
  threads start to request pages from the source side.

* This series introduces magic value (4-bytes) to be sent on the
  Postcopy channel. It helps to differentiate channels and properly
  setup incoming connections on the destination side.


Thank you.
