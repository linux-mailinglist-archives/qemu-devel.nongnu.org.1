The point of this patch is not to match the define with the option. 
Originally I had a patch that just separated memory access logs and left 
guest_errors as it is but without the memory access logs. But I think 
Philippe said that he likes this option to log both. So to satisfy all 
needs I'v added this patch to preserve what guest_errors is doing now but 
let it be changed later after some time for people to get used to it (or 
leave it if that's what people like). Leaving guest_errors to log both is 
not an option as I want to have separate options for memory access and 
guest errors so they can be turned on or off independently. So if we have 
to keep guest_errors to log both then we need a new option for just guest 
errors for which one that matches the definen seemed like an easy way that 
is consistent with the other debug options. I'd be OK to leave 
guest_errors but without the memory access logs, then this patch is not 
needed but some people did not like that before.
