We know nothing *locally*.

Commonly, a non-local argument can demonstrate safety.  Only when the
type name comes from the user, we truly know nothing.

It could also be no type at all.

Actually, object_class_is_abstract() takes an ObjectClass, not a type
name string.

The actual guards we use are variations of

    klass =3D object_class_by_name(typename);
    if (!klass) {
        error_setg(errp, "invalid object type: %s", typename);
        return NULL;
    }

    if (object_class_is_abstract(klass)) {
        error_setg(errp, "object type '%s' is abstract", typename);
        return NULL;
    }

which covers "no type at all", too.

Sometimes, we use module_object_class_by_name() instead, which I believe
additionally loads the module providing the type, if any.  Which of the
two should be used where is a mystery to me, and I suspect we're getting
it wrong in places.  But this is turning into a digression.  To
hopefully maintain focus, I'm pretending modules don't exist until later
in this message.

Sometimes, we throw in an object_class_dynamic_cast(klass, T) to check
@typename resolves to a subtype of some T.

We did not forget it there!  It's by design a thin wrapper around
object_new(), with preconditions just like object_new().

To be fair, object_new() was not designed for use with user-provided
type names.  When it chokes on type names not provided by the user, it's
clearly a programming error, and assert() is a perfectly fine way to
catch programming errors.  Same for qdev_new().

However, we do in fact use these functions with user-provided type
names, if rarely.  When we do, we need to validate the type name before
we pass it to them.

Trouble is the validation code is a bit involved, and reimplementing it
everywhere it's needed is asking for bugs.

Creating and using more interfaces that are more convenient for this
purpose would avoid that.

Three cases:

1. Type name is literal string.  No change.  This is the most common
   case.

2. It's not.

2a. Type name is user-provided.  This is rare.  We replace

        if (... guard ...) {
            ... return failure ...
        }
        obj =3D object_new(...);

    by

        obj =3D object_new_dynamic(..., errp);
        if (!obj) {
            ... return failure ...
        }

    This is an improvement.

2b. It's not.  We should replace

        obj =3D object_new(...);

    by

        obj =3D object_new_dynamic(..., &error_abort);

    Exact same behavior, just wordier, to placate the compiler.
    Tolerable as long as it's relatively rare.

    But I'm not sure it's worthwhile.  All it really does is helping
    some towards not getting case 2a wrong.  But 2a is rare.

Same for similar interfaces, e.g. qdev_new().

True!

Alright, enter modules.

Modules break a fundamental design assumption: object_new() on a
compiled-in type name is safe, i.e. the failure modes are all
programming errors.

Modules add new failure modes that are *not* programming errors:

* The module providing the type was not deployed correctly.

* It was, but the host system lacks the resources to load it.

Before modules, object_new(T) was safe unless T was user-provided.
Which implies it's safe when T is a literal string.

Since modules, object_new(T) is safe unless T is user-provided or the
type named by it is compiled as module.  This does *not* imply it's safe
when T is a literal string.

When looking at a use of object_new(), whether the argument names a type
that could be compiled as module cannot be known locally.  Therefore, we
cannot know locally whether we need to handle failure, either with a
suitable guard or by switching to a new function like
object_new_dynamic().  This is bad.

Breaking fundamental design assumptions tends to have ugly and expensive
consequences.  Consequences like having to rework every single call of
object_new() & friends.

Can we reduce the damage?  Maybe.  What if we create a
module_object_new() that takes an Error **, and make object_new() crash
& burn when the @typename argument resolves to a type provided by a
module?

Maybe module_object_new() and object_new_dynamic() could be fused into a
single function with a better name.
