Christoph linked here on his submission to Linux of a fix for this, so I
am reviving this to leave a couple comments :)

It doesn't quite do this right now. It only makes the assumption for
CPUs where marchid and mvendorid are zero. The c908, and I think Guo Ren
confirmed it will be the case going forward, sets these to non-zero
values. We should have always required a dt property be set, rather than
using m*id, but we can't go back on that for these devices. Going
forward, if there are more CPUs that want to use this e.g. C908 in MAEE
mode (it can do svpbmt too) I'm gonna require it is explicitly set in
DT.

Aye, and the case of a new CPU disabling it but not setting m*id will be
a pain.

I don't really want to have extension detection side channels like this
in Linux if it can be at all avoided, I'd rather get this information from
DT or ACPI. The marchid =3D=3D mvendorid =3D=3D 0x0 case has a pretty high =
chance
of needing some special handling in the future though, so something
targeting those cases when there's some demonstrable problem seems fair
to me.

Cheers,
Conor.
