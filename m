Yep, pre-conditions need to be something developers can be reasonably
expected to accurately comply with.

Yep, at least for static object creation using since we're using the
pattern "object_new(TYPE_BLAH)" - even if TYPE_BLAH contains a typo,
it'll be the same typo passed in the .name = TYPE_BLAH of  TypeInfo,
so all will work fine if following normal code patterns.

No, but this series came out of Peter's proposal to introduce the
idea of Singleton classes, which would cause object_new to assert
in fun new scenarios. Effectively adding a new pre-condition and
would thus require all places which pass a dynamic type name to
object_new(), to be updated with a "if singleton..." check. I
wasn't happy with the idea of adding that precondition without a
way to enforce that we've not missed checks somewhere in the code.

Of course this pre-condition applies to static object_new calls
too, but those are less risky as the developer (probably) has the
mental context that the static object_new call is for a singleton.

Yeah, the idea of a dummy stub until realize is called fills me with
worry. It feels like something where it would be really easy to make
a mistake and have code that crashes interacting with an unrealized
object that doesn't have the struct fields you expect it to have, or
has the struct fields, but not initialized since no 'init' method
was run.

A slight refinement of your idea would be to break anything modular
into 2 distinct objects classes. MyDeviceFacade and MyDeviceImpl.
Creators of the device always call object_new(TYPE_MY_DEVICE_FACADE),
and the realize() method would load the module and make thje call
to object_new(TYPE_MY_DEVICE_IMPL).

Making something currently built-in, into a module, would involve
a bunch of tedious refactoring work, so I don't much like the
thought of choosing this as a design approach.

It would be nice to have a unified model between object and devices
for the complete/realize approach, but that's a slight tangent.

Perhaps more common than we care to admit. eg most block device drivers
are safe, except for a few we modularized which are unsafe. Most ui
frontends would be safe, except for a few we modularized. This pattern
of "except for a few we modularized" has been repeated all over, and
conceptually that's not a bad thing, as we wanted to make it easy to
modularize things incrementally.

Looking at our current /usr/bin/qemu-system-XXX binaries, they range in
size from 6 MB to 30 MB, stripped, ignoring linked libraries. Considering
work on the qemu-system-any binary that is intended to unify all targets,
I wouldn't be surprised if it came out at over 100 MB with all devices
from all targets included.

Is qemu-system-any pushing us to a place where our approach to modules
is in fact wrong ?

Modularizing piecemeal let us cull the big offenders that pulled in
huge external libraries.

People still complain QEMU is "too big" and binaries linked to too
many legacy devices.

With my distro hat on, if we had 'qemu-system-any' would I really
want to have it as monolithic binary ?

I think I would want to have loadable TCG backends for each target,
and I would want all the devices for each target to be loadable too.
eg, so I could have a 'qemu-system-any' RPM with just the core, and
'qemu-system-modules-arm', 'qemu-system-modules-x86_64', etc, or
even more fine grained than that.

IOW, everything is a module by default. Not necccessarily
1 object == 1 module, more  "N objects == 1 module", but certainly
with very few objects built-in.

In such a world, IMHO, it doesn't make sense to have TypeInfoSafe
and TypeInfoUnsafe, with different object_new/object_try_new
methods. I think we would have to accept that object_new must
get an "Error **errp", and possibly even the 'init" method too.
It would force us to make sure we can propagage into errp in
all the key places we can't do so today wrt object lifecycles.


Overall I've talked myself into believing my series here is not
worthwhile, as it doesn't solve a big enough problem, and it
needs somethign more ambituous.
