What you said makes sense.  It's just that the concern still exists, and
I'm not sure whether that'll be too much to ask for a customer.

Also, see this commit:

commit 15e41345906d29a319cc9cdf566347bf79134d24
Author: Eduardo Habkost <ehabkost@redhat.com>
Date:   Wed Aug 26 13:25:44 2015 -0300

    target-i386: Enable "check" mode by default
    
    Current default behavior of QEMU is to silently disable features that
    are not supported by the host when a CPU model is requested in the
    command-line. This means that in addition to risking breaking guest ABI
    by default, we are silent about it.
    
    I would like to enable "enforce" by default, but this can easily break
    existing production systems because of the way libvirt makes assumptions
    about CPU models today (this will change in the future, once QEMU
    provide a proper interface for checking if a CPU model is runnable).
    
    But there's no reason we should be silent about it. So, change
    target-i386 to enable "check" mode by default so at least we have some
    warning printed to stderr (and hopefully logged somewhere) when QEMU
    disables a feature that is not supported by the host system.

I don't think I know what's the "libvirt assumptions" mentioned, and how it
changed as of today.  I had a vague memory Libvirt constantly set off on
some of the relevant flags last time Jiri explained some cpuid issues to
me; maybe it's "check" not "enforce"? It would be great if Jiri or Dan can
comment here.

Copy Igor too from the commit.
