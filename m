I still feel like this is more trouble than is worth. You've already had to
special case exclude 'glib' from this conversion, which is our biggest dep
when it comes to external headers, to place bindgen & this sounds liable to
extend to other deps as we expand the use of rust.

The problems like the one we see with fuse are pretty infrequent and haven't
been a significant source of pain for QEMU historically IME.

With regards,
Daniel
