"-merge-platform" shouldn't be a QEMU parameter, but should be something
separate.

Yes, as you mentioned there it could be a lot of work, we may need to think
it through and collect enough input before working on something like that.

"nomigrate" may be inaccurate or even wrong in this case, because as long
as the features are supported on both hosts it's migratable.

I am not sure whether you meant to e.g. add a migration blocker in this
case even if migration can be supported between some hosts.  But if so it
may not be wise either to block users trying to migrate where it is still
applicable.  So maybe I misunderstood.
