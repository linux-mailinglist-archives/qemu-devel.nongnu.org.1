I think what I missed is that we probably don't want to call arbitrary
callbacks from .wait(), but only in the dispatching phase. At the same
time, we need to fill the ready_list during .wait() and can't do that
later, so we do have to go through all CQEs here. The only way I can see
to get rid of the extra list - which I would really like to see - would
be processing the CQEs twice (once during .wait() for the internal ones
and once during the dispatch phase for the add_sqe() ones). That's a bit
annoying.

Either way, even if we keep the list, scheduling and cancelling BHs from
the fdmon still doesn't feel quite right to me. I wonder if we shouldn't
introduce a .dispatch() callback in FDMonOps that could run the
cqe_handler_ready_list for fdmon-io_uring. That would also make the
interface more consistent with the set of callbacks we have for GSource,
and maybe eventually simplify deduplicating them.

Then you also don't need the ugly optimisation in the next patch that
fixes the slowness of scheduling BHs in .wait() by moving io_uring code
to the AioContext core.
