The only value I see in allowing a profile to be disabled is to undo the
enabling of the profile by specifying the profile as 'off' to the right of
it being specified as 'on'. That may seem pointless, but scripts take
advantage of being able to do that. Besides that one possible use case,
there isn't much use in disabling profiles, but treating profile
properties like every other boolean property makes the UI consistent and
should actually simplify the code.

Given a platform which implements a profile which mandates extension E and
a need to debug E or test behavior where E is [incorrectly] absent, you'll
need to expand the profile first, listing each of the other extensions
manually. It'd be much faster to specify the profile, take away the
extension, and ignore the warning.

I do agree with the concern that warnings will be missed/ignored. Maybe
QEMU needs something like -Werror for stuff like this, i.e.

 -cpu rv64,error-on-extension-warnings=on,profile-A=on,extension-of-A=off

would error out, but, without the special property, just warn. Or, flip
the default behavior around with

 -cpu rv64,ignore-extension-errors=on,profile-A=on,extension-of-A=off

which would either silently proceed or just warn, but, without the
special property, error out. libvirt would default to the error out
case, whichever that one is, but also provide an element to turn off
erroring-out.

Thanks,
