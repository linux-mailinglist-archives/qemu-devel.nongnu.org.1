Fine with typical developer machines, but the shared runners in
gitlab are fairly resource constrained by comparison, and resources
are often under contention from other VMs in their infra.

As a point of reference, 'ninja' defaults to '$nproc + 2'.

It is quite simple:

  git remote add gitlab ssh://git@gitlab.com/<yourusername>/qemu
  git push gitlab -o QEMU_CI=2

this immediately runs all pipelines jobs. USe QEMU_CI=1 to not
start any jobs, and let you manually start the subset you are
interested in checking

QEMU has differnt test suites too. The unit tests are likely safe
to run fully parallel, but the block I/O tests and qtests are likely
to benefit from serialization, since they all spawn many QEMU processes
as children that will consume multiple CPUs, so we probably don't need
to run the actually test suite in parallel to max out the CPUs. Still
needs testing under gitlab CI to prove the theory.

With regards,
Daniel
