The original code which claims to be based on i.MX6 Applications Processor
actually fails for the example given there in page 4131 where the lower 
is set to 0xd0000000
the upper to 0x8000000 and the limit to 0xd000ffff which gives us a size 
of 0x8000000000010000,
which is a negative number. Therefore some fix need to be done.

Your suggestion solve this issue and gives the correct address even if 
the addresses are translated by for example by a multiple of 4G, e.g 
0x200000000,
but it won't work if the range is translated in a way that is cross 4G 
boundary (e.g. translate by 0x2ffff000).

After reviewing the mathematics I've found a solution which to my 
humiliation is more simple and it is likely that the HW
is doing it, and this is just to ignore the high 32 bits of the 
calculation's result. That is:
const uint64_t size = ((uint64_t)viewport->limit - base + 1) & 0xffffffff;

So this brings the implementation to complies with the spec it claims 
that it is based upon.
Is this acceptable or you have a counter example.?
