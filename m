The data we transport is MultiFDPages_t, yes, but the MultiFDMethods are
either nocomp, or the compression-specific methods
(e.g. zlib_send_prepare).

How do we add methods for the upcoming new payload types? I don't expect
us to continue using nocomp and then do "if (ram)... else if
(device_state) ..." inside of them. I would expect us to rename
s/nocomp/ram/ and add a new set of MultiFDMethods for the new data type
(e.g. vfio_send_prepare, vmstate_send_prepare, etc).

multifd_nocomp_ops -> multifd_ram_ops // rename
multifd_zlib_ops   // existing
multifd_device_ops // new

The challenge here is that the current framework is nocomp
vs. compression. It needs to become ram + compression vs. other types.

That't the v1 cover letter (1). I don't like to post v2 with "here's
what changed" without having the previous cover-letter at hand for
referencing.
