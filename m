-smp sets machine property "smp" of QAPI type SMPConfiguration.

So this one adds members l1i-cache-topo, l1d-cache-topo, ... to
SMPConfiguration.

Keyval is a variation of the QEMU's traditional KEY=VALUE,... syntax
that can serve as an alternative to JSON, with certain restrictions.
Ideally, we provide both JSON and keyval syntax on the command line.

Example: -blockdev supports both JSON and keyval.
    JSON:   -blockdev '{"driver": "null-co", "node-name": "node0"}'
    keyval: -blockdev null-co,node-name=node0

Unfortunately, we have many old interfaces that still lack JSON support.

This one adds a single member caches to SMPConfiguration.  It is an
array of objects.

This one wraps the same array of objects in a new user-creatable object,
then sets machine property "smp-caches" to that object.

We can set machine properties directly with -machine.  But -machine
doesn't support JSON, yet.

Wrapping in an object moves the configuration to -object, which does
support JSON.

Half way between 2nd and 3rd:

  * Cache list object in machine

    -machine caches.0.name=l1i,caches.0.topo=core,\
             caches.1.name=l1d,caches.1.topo=core

Can't say, since I don't understand where you want to go.

Looks like your trying to design an interface for what you want to do
now, and are wondering whether it could evolve to accomodate what you
want to do later.

It's often better to design the interface for everything you already
know you want to do, then take out the parts you want to do later.

I'd rather not let syntactic limitations of our CLI dictate the
structure of our configuration data.  Design the structure *first*.
Only then start to think about CLI.  Our CLI is an unholy mess, and
thinking about it too early risks getting lost in the weeds.  I fear
this is what happened to you.

If I forcibly ignore all the considerations related to concrete syntax
in your message, a structure seems to emerge: there's a set of caches
identified by name (l1i, l1d, ...), and for each cache, we have a number
of configurable properties (topology level, ...).  Makes sense?

What else will you need to configure in the future?

By the way, extending -machine to support JSON looks feasible to me at a
glance.
