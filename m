Okay.

Yeah that could be another option. Test pnv.dtb or add a new bool
to pnv if you need to check whether the fdt has been provided by
cmdline.

Right, but when you reboot it needs to be reverted to initial
(pre-CAS) fdt.

Ah, I should have followed a bit closer. riscv, arm use a
machine_done notifier for that (and x86, loongarch for ACPI / BIOS
tables). So that avoids fdt rebuild after the first reset I think.

Anyway I don't really mind then, following other archs would be okay,
but keeping similar with spapr and avoiding code change is also good.
Maybe add a small comment to we use reset rather than machine_done
notifier of other archs to be similar to spapr.

Thanks,
Nick
