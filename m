I have CCed Phil. He has been working on heterogenous target emulation
and might be interested.

At a high level this is similar to the vfio-user feature where a PCI
device is emulated in a separate process. This also involves sending
messages describing QEMU's MemoryRegion accesses. See the "remote"
machine type in QEMU to look at the code.

The fundamental problem is that address_space_ldq_be() is synchronous,
so there is no way to return back to the caller until the response has
been received.

vfio-user didn't solve this problem. It simply blocks until the
response is received, but it does drop the Big QEMU Lock during this
time so that other vCPU threads can run. For example, see
hw/remote/proxy.c:send_bar_access_msg() and
mpqemu_msg_send_and_await_reply().

QEMU supports nested event loops, but they come with their own set of
gotchas. The way a nested event loop might help here is to send the
request and then call aio_poll() to receive the response in another
IOReadHandler. This way other event loop processing can take place
while waiting in address_space_ldq_be().

The second problem is that this approach where QEMU processes send
requests to each other needs to be implemented carefully to avoid
deadlocks. For example, devices that do DMA could load/store memory
belonging to another device handled by another QEMU. Once there is an
A -> B -> A situation it could deadlock.

Both vfio-user and vhost-user have similar issues with their
bi-directional communication where a device emulation process can send
a message to QEMU while processing a message from QEMU. Deadlock can
be avoided if the code is structured so that QEMU is able to receive
new requests during the time when it is waiting for a response.
