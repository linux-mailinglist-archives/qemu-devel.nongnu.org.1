See hw/ppc/spapr.c::spapr_create_nvram(). Looks like it would add a drive 
give with -drive if=pflash,index=0 as the nvram backing file. I don't know 
if it generates the default if an empty file is passed or maybe SLOF would 
do that which then could be used for VOF too and that's how it was made? 
So you could try running -machine spapr with an empty nvram with slof then 
compare that to the default for VOF.

If is't not auto-created with the default values and not easy to create 
then maybe more convenient for users to get an example.
