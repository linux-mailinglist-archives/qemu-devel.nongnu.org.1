Whether it is enabled by default or disabled by default isn't a
totally fatal problem. If QEMU can toggle it to the opposite value,
we have the same level of configurability in both cases.

It does, however, have implications for QEMU as if KVM gained support
for exposing the new feature by default and QEMU didn't know about
it, then the guest ABI would have changed without QEMU realizing it.

IOW, it would imply a requirement for timely QEMU updates to match
the kernel, which is something we wouldn't need in x86 world where
the feature is disabled by default. Disable by default is a more
stable approach from QEMU's POV.

"Fun" is probably not the word I'd pick :-)

Right, this makes life quite challenging for QEMU. The premise of named
CPU models (as opposed to -host), is to facilitate the migration of VMs
between heterogenous hardware platforms. That assumes it is possible to
downgrade the CPU on both src + dst, to the common baseline you desire.

If we were to define a named CPU model, for that to be usable, QEMU
would have to be able to query the "maxmimum" architectural features,
and validate that the delta between the host maximum, and the named
CPU model is possible to downgrade. Is arm providing sufficient info
to let QEMU do that ?

With regards,
Daniel
