Conceptually "exec:" is a nice thing, but from a practical POV it
introduces difficulties for QEMU. QEMU doesn't know if the exec'd
command will provide a unidirectional channel or bidirectional
channel, so has to assume the worst - unidirectional. It also can't
know if it is safe to run the exec multiple times, or is only valid
to run it once - so afgai nhas to assume once only.

We could fix those by adding further flags in the migration address
to indicate if its bi-directional & multi-channel safe.

Technically "exec" is obsolete given "fd", but then that applies to
literally all protocols. Implementing them in QEMU is a more user
friendly thing.

Exec was more compelling when QEMU's other protocols were less
mature, lacking TLS for example, but I still find it interesting
as a facility.

With regards,
Daniel
