Having a second format for blobs is unfortunate.

I can't judge whether the convenience of sharing the format with other
tools is worth the additional interface complexity and code.  It could
be if it avoids having to re-encode from hex to base64 in multiple
places.

Got to trust your judgement here.

Commit messages are usually a good home for rationale.

I wonder how much of this, if anything, should be worked into the doc
comment.  You decide :)

With the typo I pointed out fixed:
