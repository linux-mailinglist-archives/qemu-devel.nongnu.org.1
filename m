I wonder if there's any value in enhancing the trace support to
let us tag certain probes with some kind of "severity"/"level"
concept, such that when the 'log' trace backend is enabled we
can wire them through to the logging backend with useful
categorization ?

IMHO the documentation benefit of '-d help' is somewhat
inconsistent.

I tried a crude grep for different usage of logging

      2 CPU_LOG_EXEC
    122 CPU_LOG_INT
    103 CPU_LOG_MMU
      6 CPU_LOG_PAGE
      1 CPU_LOG_PLUGIN
      8 CPU_LOG_RESET
     10 CPU_LOG_TB_IN_ASM
      4 CPU_LOG_TB_OP
   1715 LOG_GUEST_ERROR
      4 LOG_INVALID_MEM
    753 LOG_UNIMP

So the overwhealming majority of usage is accumulated under
two "catch all" categories - "guest error" and "unimplemented"
with no ability to filter - its all or nothing.

We ought to be able to do a better job at documentation the
trace events than we do today, given we have them in an
easily extractable format and can associate them with
particular files easily.

The 'qemu-trace-stap list' command can list all available
probes in a binary, but it only works for the systemtap
backend. We ought to do better with other backends.

Yep, we're somewhat inconsistent in our prefix naming
conventions. It would be nice to try to enforce some
greater standard there, but its hard to do programmatically.

I think emitting multi-line blocks of text probably ought to be
considered out of scope for tracing. The 'log' backend is the
only one where that would be a reasonable semantic match.

With regards,
Daniel
