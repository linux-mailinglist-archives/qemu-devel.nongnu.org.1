Also ping Shaoqin and Eric,

Hopefully I can get your input on interface design to align with the
Arm requirements together!

Yeah, that's fine for x86.

@Shaoqin, hi Shaoqin, if I use a global action for all events, is this
Okay for Arm?

I suppose this should work, since the interface here needs to enumerate
events one by one, and doesn't support a continuous enumeration format
(0x0-0x3) like the previous implementation. Right?

The main consideration here is also to align with the underlying ioctl
of the PMU filter, Arm's ioctl is per vCPU and I'm not sure if there
will be a difference between CPUs in the feature.

But this I think could be an arch-specific implementation, x86 needs per
VM then use ¡°-accel kvm,pmu-filter=obj_id¡±, Arm if it does need per vCPU
then it can be set for Arm CPUs via ¡°-cpu host,pmu-filter=obj_id¡±. So
the generic part is this kvm-pmu-filter object itself, where exactly it
should be placed/inserted can be decided by the architecture itself.

Hi @Eric and @Shaoqin, do you agree?
