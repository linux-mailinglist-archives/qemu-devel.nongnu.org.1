The reason I sent out this small series quickly is mainly for Dongli to 
as a reference.

In fact, there are mess on LBR enabling that it checks enable_pmu 
everytime with CPUID_7_0_EDX_ARCH_LBR as well as 
CPUID_8000_0022_EAX_PERFMON_V2. That's on my WIP list to clean it up.

I think I need to check if they are duplicated with Dapeng/Zide's series.

IMHO, they stand as their own. I'll leave it to Paolo to make the decision.
