Let me use anology:=20
if QOM doesn't suite purpose / too complex and someone duplicates it droppi=
ng
some parts of it along the way, the request to merge it (even temporarily) =
very
likely will get hard refusal.

It's ok to do this for RFC/POC to play around but it's not ok to merge
such code into mainline.

it's a price of unification.

Typically duplicating a huge chunk of code is frowned upon,
there might be exceptions in case of putting out fires and we need to get
a fix quickly in (even then it's not likely to be merged),
but this series is very much not the case.

On top of that, I'd say double no to duplicating guest ABI that
the copied code exposes to guest and than trying to reconcile it later.

So, please reuse/refactor existing code.

It's not clear what you are trying to say/point out.
If I'd guess, you've meant arg "HotplugHandler *hotplug_dev".
For one, HotplugHandler long overgrown its name, it's more like PlugHandler,
meant to wire things up. One can rename it if necessary.

Also suggest a better way/prototype for build_ged_aml() if it doesn't work
for you.

in cover letter review, I've suggested a way how to split the series in
a digestible parts some of which could be done in parallel.
wrt this patch see my comments above.
