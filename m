Yes, but when the mgmt already has exit-on-error and be able to pull errors
on both sides, it'll be a problem because mgmt will start to see two errors.

But indeed even before this patch, mgmt can already see two errors.. the
src error being an IO failure. I wonder how libvirt decides which error to
use, and whether some patch like this one would confuse mgmt (consider mgmt
now ignores IO errors when the other error reports something meaningful,
but then mgmt starts to see both errors are not IO errors).

One thing we could do (without worrying about disturbing mgmt) might be we
store the dest error separately on src..  Then we expose it separately in
qeury-migrate too (then mgmt / HMP can decide what error to show).
