Sure, this isn't a blocker indeed.  So if we want we can fit into the
picture.

Yes, this should be listed as one of the benefits.  We could have more
e.g., transaction support mentioned below, even if I'm not yet familiar
with it; meanwhile I'll have some other comments that may make this less
beneficial, more below.

So at least we have two advantages here (comparing to... the rest, which
might be disadvantages or challenges..).

This may or may not be a benefit in case of migration..  I almost keep
getting complains from people on libvirt migrating stuck at 99% (where
libvirt implemented the meter for migration), only because the meter
doesn't make much sense for most of migrations, aka, precopy.. which is
unfortunate..

Yep.  Is transaction about auto-rewind when some job fails (hence,
apply-all or apply-none)?

One thing I should mention here is I am aware that not all the transaction
(where migration is relevant) always only involves QMP commands.

One example is when kubenetes is taking into the picture and if we need
e.g. block snapshots over kubenetes storage (where block drives are almost
always RAW rather than QCOW2), then in the future then we may not always be
able to benefit from a QEMU-only / QMP-only transaction system.

The other thing is, IMHO such transaction system would be more helpful when
we start to adopt new features, so we write less code in mgmt.  If we have
all the codes ready for libvirt on error handling anyway for migration for
all these years... moving it over may add extra work instead..

And if combining the two ideas of above, when there's possible transaction
that may take operation outside QEMU, then IIUC libvirt will always need to
manage its own unwind operation.

It looks like the 2nd benefit might be less appealing.  But maybe I have
some loopholes on the understanding.

Yep, this isn't a blocker either, just like the job status.  But we already
now touched fundamentally the core of jobs on status / verbs..

It's just that IMHO the more work we need in Jobs to fit migration, the
more points we need to add on top of "disadvantages" when we compare it
against the advantages.
