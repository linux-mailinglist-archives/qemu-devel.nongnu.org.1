Maybe we can avoid calling out "checkpoint/restore", but something like
"migration on identical hosts" or something.

AFAIU that's what we do with many arm64 systems on the vcpu models with KVM
(IIRC it's still about using "virt" machines), where we simply mostly
require it's the identical bare metal host or weird things can happen when
migration happens.
