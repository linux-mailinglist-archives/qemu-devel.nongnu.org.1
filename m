The problem is not a partial state update in an instruction, but rather
that on some targets restore_state_to_opc is more than just a
"restore" - it is also "prepare for handling an exception", i.e.:

- arm: exception.syndrome
- hppa: unwind_breg, psw_n
- mips: btarget
- openrisc: ppc
- riscv: excp_uw2
- s390x: int_pgm_ilen

Some of these may be wrong due to unfamiliarity with the respective
architectures, sorry - but this illustrates the idea.
