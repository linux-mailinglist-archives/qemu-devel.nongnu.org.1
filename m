Thanks, I'll give this a try.

I folded your suggestion in with a couple of minor tweaks:

commit 61de78986912b03f08354a177caf603857b531b5
Author: Mark Johnston <markj@FreeBSD.org>
Date:   Wed Jul 16 20:32:05 2025 +0000

    9pfs: Add FreeBSD support
    
    This is largely derived from existing Darwin support.  FreeBSD
    apparently has better support for *at() system calls so doesn't require
    workarounds for a missing mknodat().  The implementation has a couple of
    warts however:
    - The extattr(2) system calls don't support anything akin to
      XATTR_CREATE or XATTR_REPLACE, so a racy workaround is implemented.
    - Attribute names cannot begin with "user." or "system." on ZFS.
      However FreeBSD's extattr(2) system calls support two dedicated
      namespaces for these two.  So "user." or "system." prefixes are
      trimmed off from attribute names and instead EXTATTR_NAMESPACE_USER or
      EXTATTR_NAMESPACE_SYSTEM are picked and passed to extattr system calls
      accordingly.
    
    The 9pfs tests were verified to pass on the UFS, ZFS and tmpfs
    filesystems.
