Hi,
Hope everyone is doing well. I was looking at "Bite Sized" tagged QEMU
issues in gitlab to see if there is anything that makes sense for me
as a first time contributor. I see this issue "QEMU gives wrong MPIDR
value for Arm CPU types with MT=1" (gitlab URL:
https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/1608 ).

From the bug ticket description, it is very clear that I will need to
add a bool member variable in the "AarchCPU" struct which is in
"target/arm/cpu.h" file. I believe the next logical change is to set
this member variable to "true" in the corresponding arm cpu "initfn"
functions (a55, a76, noeverse_n1) which are in "target/arm/cpu64.c"
file. I have a few questions about the following steps as I am looking
through the code.

1. I believe I will need to update the "arm_build_mp_affinity"
function in "target/arm/cpu.c" file to now also take in a bool
parameter that will indicate if the function should instead put the
"core index" in the "aff1" bits instead of the existing logic of
"aff0" bits and the cluster id in the "aff2" bits instead of the
existing logic of "aff1" bits. But I see this function being invoked
from 3 other files: "hw/arm/sbsa-ref.c", "hw/arm/virt.c",
"hw/arm/npcm7xx.c". Should the function calls in these files always
have that corresponding argument set to "false"?

2. As per the bug ticket description, I will also need to update the
"mpidr_read_val" function in the "target/arm/helper.c" file to only
set the MT bit (24th) to 1 if the member variable is true. I think
there is nothing else to be done in this function apart from checking
and then setting the MT bit. Is my assumption correct?

I think doing the above steps should fix the bug and probably we don't
need anything else. It would be great if someone can help me answer
the questions or any suggestion would be great if my assumptions are
wrong. Thanks.

Regards,
Dorjoy.
