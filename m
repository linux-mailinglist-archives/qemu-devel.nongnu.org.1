AFAICT, there are two open questions for that patch:

1. "mbr" vs "partitioned".
I do think "partitioned" is clearer, a bit more casual friendly. "mbr"
requires knowledge about FAT format, while what's a partition should
be known by a wider audience.
Side note, in V3, I'll remove the "unpartitioned" keyword to simply
replace it by "partitoned=3Dfalse" (I wasn't aware such an obvious
possibility was working...). So we might even call it
"partition/partitions=3Dtrue|false".

2. The default value. Should it be "false" for @floppy ?
IMO, having a default value independent of other arguments is always
better. Hence, I'll push for keeping "partitioned=3Dtrue" as the
default, and having users forcing "partitioned=3Dfalse" for floppy (an
error being raised otherwise). As we'll probably change the default
behavior with floppy anyway (cf patch 2), I don't think it will hurt a
lot to make users passing a new flag.
