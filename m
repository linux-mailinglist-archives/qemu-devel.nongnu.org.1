As I also answered in the kernel patch, IMHO we have to return an error, 
because any setups are broken anyway (see the problem we're fixing with 
this patch), so at this point it's better to return an error, so they 
don't spend time figuring out why the VDUSE device doesn't work.

So we have to assume that it doesn't support it, to be more 
conservative, right?

Yep, I see.

I think VDUSE needs to negotiate features (if it doesn't already) as 
vhost-user does with the backend. Also for new future functionality.
