I looked into this and it's cumbersome:

- We'd need to check migrate_direct_io() several times, once to get the
  second fd and during every IO to know to use the fd.

- Even getting the second fd is not straight forward, we need to create
  a new ioc for it with qio_channel_new_path(). But QEMUFile is generic
  code, so we'd probably need to call this channel-file specific
  function from migration_channel_connect().

- With the new ioc, do we put it in QEMUFile, or do we take the fd only?
  Or maybe an ioc with two fds? Or a new QIOChannelDirect? All options
  look bad to me.

So I suggest we proceed proceed with the 1 multifd channel approach,
passing 2 fds into QEMU just like we do for the n channels. Is that ok
from libvirt's perspective? I assume libvirt users are mostly interested
in _enabling_ parallelism with --parallel, instead of _avoiding_ it with
the ommision of the option, so main thread + 1 channel should not be a
bad thing.

Choosing to use 1 multifd channel now is also a gentler introduction for
when we finally move all of the vmstate migration into multifd (I've
been looking into this, but don't hold your breaths).
