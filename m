Loss of introspection precision is a concern, not a hard "no".

We weigh all the concerns, and pick a solution we hate the least :)

In practice, it's closer to "HMP must be base on QMP when the
functionality does or should exist in QMP."

I'm afraid I didn't get this part.

What's the difference to "unstable"?

I don't think it's worth the trouble.  The "x-" prefix is now strictly
for humans, and humans can figure out what the x- in @x-origin,
@y-origin means.
