Always-always, or should the run script do a just-in-time install when
invoked? (Reading ahead: You mean always-always.) I recall we had
competing ideas for the runscript, you didn't see mine, and yours got
merged. Fine by me, but I forget the details. Where is your script...?

(I forget where the hell I was with all of this, my best recollection
is that there is some fine-tuning to do with what dependencies get
installed with which targets and when. I suppose I'll try to hammer
out this specific issue as it's the most recent one in my inbox, then
I will refresh and resend my series and see where we land.)

Ah, okay. I think my only concern about doing this was that it was
potentially slow and I was trying to be very aggressive about not
installing anything that was not strictly necessary for the build. I
do agree it's for more than 'tests', though - as you point out, it's
for developer tooling too.

I'm not against always installing it, I think, but I have some
lingering half-remembered reasons that made me think we didn't want
that. I don't remember why. If there's no opposition to it, I guess I
can just do that and see what happens...

Alright.

mmmmm, OK. Let me catch up on some of my other emails and see what the
other lingering complaints I can find are, and I will make a pass at a
version that just installs qemu.qmp unconditionally. Feel free to yell
at me on IRC with any lingering concerns you can think of to help me
get back up to speed after my marathon break...
