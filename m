I tend to agree that it's misleading to print the CPU type name in the
error message in hw/core/machine.c::machine_run_board_init(), where the CPU
type is validated. qemu_opts may be too heavy for this. It eventually turns
to a machine's property if @machine_opts_dict is the best place to store
'-cpu input'. Besides, it doesn't fit for another case very well, where
current_machine->cpu_type = machine_class->default_cpu_type if '-cpu input'
isn't provided by user.

For simplicity, how about to add MachineState::cpu_model? It's initialized to
cpu_model_from_type(machine_class->default_cpu_type) in qemu_init(), or
g_strdump(model_pieces[0) in parse_cpu_option().
