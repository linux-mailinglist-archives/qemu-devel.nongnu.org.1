I wanted to talk about the impact on Windows implementation.

What if AMD implements 1 year later? Then at that time, the Windows will 
even fail booting on real AMD. Do you think is the correct 
implementation of Windows?

Oh, no. It's not the rule of virtualization.

With virtualization, we don't need to present the vcpu 100% the same 
with real silicon. We can expose more (useful) features to vcpu as long 
as it's architecturally correct.

And with virtualization, people can tailor their own vcpu with different 
features/vendors/FMS as long as the configuration is architecturally 
correct.

 From the description, doesn't Windows do something like

   if (IS_AMD && CPUID(arch_capabilities))
	ERROR(UNSUPPORTED PROCESSOR)

The problem is software cannot assume CPUID(arch_capabilities) is 0 on AMD.

No, it's not a bug of KVM, nor QEMU.
