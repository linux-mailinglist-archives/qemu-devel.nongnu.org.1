I guess it probably doesn't hurt to have it. Perhaps tweak to

 This policy does not apply to other uses of AI, such as researching APIs or
 algorithms, static analysis, or debugging, provided their output is not
 to be included in contributions.

and for the last paragraph remove 'both' and add a tailer

   Examples of tools impacted by this policy include GitHub's CoPilot,
   OpenAI's ChatGPT, and Meta's Code Llama (amongst many others which are less
   well known), and code/content generation agents which are built on top of
   such tools.
