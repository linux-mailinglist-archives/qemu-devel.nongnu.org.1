But all the updates and reads are done in the critical sections, and
will be that way in the future too. That's the reason why the iova
tree does not have any mutex or equivalent.

If we take out SVQ from BQL, we will need to protect the update of it
with something, either a mutex or similar. But that's already part of
the plan, even without my proposal or if we implement this RFC the way
it is.

The point is that SVQ already needs to work like that, as it needs to
support that a contiguous GPA range is splitted between different HVA.
Moreover, this is not a part of SVQ, but of VirtQueue. Both should be
extremely rare cases. Is it worth it to complicate / penalize the
general case solution to benefit this weird case, which is supported?

I think that IOVA should just replace GPA in the tree, isn't it? Or am
I missing something?

So the user of the IOVA tree (vhost-vdpa.c) should be slightly changed
but there is no change required for SVQ or IOVATree as far as I know.
