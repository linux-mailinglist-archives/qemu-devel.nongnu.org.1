They should be pretty low-risk.

At least the first one very definitely fixes a bug, albeit obscure, that
you can trigger in the wild. (Run a macOS guest and turn off MSI-X on the
XHCI controller but leave MSI enabled, and QEMU will crash with a failed
assertion.) So sure, why not apply this to stable.

I don't know if there are any extant guest OSes where the second patch is a
necessary and sufficient fix. macOS will refuse to drive an XHCI controller
with numintrs < 4 altogether. Other guest OSes I've tried never attempt to
use more than one interrupter/event ring anyway. However, the patch
implements the behaviour that is explicitly and clearly described in the
spec regarding the situation of unsupported interrupter mapping.

macOS's driver needs this behaviour of no interrupter mapping when using
pin-based interrupts even on a controller with nominally numintrs > 1, so
to fix that you additionally need patch 9 and you enable the flag
implemented in that patch. (I have to admit I'm still not convinced we need
the flag: in my opinion the spec under-defines the pin-based situation
anyway, and I struggle to imagine a sensible use case for the [current]
behaviour with the flag disabled. More detailed discussion in the original
RFC thread:
https://patchew.org/QEMU/20241201160316.96121-1-phil@philjordan.eu/ )

So the macOS compatibility fix for pin-based mode needs patches 2+9 and as
it stands that introduces a new property, which I think disqualifies it
from merging into *-stable?
I'm not sure it's worth applying patch 2 on its own to any stable branches.

I'm hoping Nick Piggin (cc'd) might post an updated and ready to merge
version of his patches to upgrade the XHCI qtest suite, as I'd really like
to build test cases for these patches on top of that.

<br>
&gt; The macOS guest initially did not work well with QEMU&#39;s XHCI contr=
oller,<br>
&gt; which required some investigation, bug fixing, and a work-around.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Essentially, the macOS driver attempts to use XHCI event rings 1 and 2=
<br>
&gt; even when there is only a single pin-based interrupt available. The<br=
>
&gt; interrupts for rings 1 and 2 are dropped, and so events are only handl=
ed<br>
&gt; after a timeout. The driver appears to expect the device to act as if<=
br>
&gt; interrupter mapping was not supported - the spec only mentions that<br=
>
&gt; interrupter mapping should be disabled if only one interrupter is<br>
&gt; enabled, not one interrupt, although there is potential ambiguity in<b=
r>
&gt; the spec&#39;s wording around enabling and disabling interrupters.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; In any case, this investigation has led to 3 changes:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0* The spec requires that modulo arithmetic be used for sel=
ecting<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0the MSI vector to notify from the interrupter/event=
 ring index.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0(Patch 1)<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0* The spec requires that all events be directed at ring 0 =
if<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0interrupter mapping is not available; the condition=
 for this<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0mentioned in the spec is when there is only 1 inter=
rupter<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0available. (Patch 2)<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0* A property is added to the PCI XHCI controller classes t=
o disable<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0interrupter mapping when using pin-based interrupts=
. This makes<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0the macOS guest drivers work. (Patch 9) This is ena=
bled in the<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0vmapple machine type, which does not offer MSI(-X) =
support.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; There are currently a few limitations to the vmapple machine. These<br=
>
&gt; aren&#39;t intrinsic, just imperfect emulation of the VZF, but it&#39;=
s good<br>
&gt; enough to be just about usable for some purposes:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0* macOS 12 guests only. Versions 13+ currently fail during=
 early boot.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0* macOS 11+ arm64 hosts only, with hvf accel. (Perhaps som=
e differences<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0between Apple M series CPUs and TCG&#39;s aarch64 i=
mplementation? macOS<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0hosts only because ParavirtualizedGraphics.framewor=
k is a black box<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0implementing most of the logic behind the apple-gfx=
 device.)<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0* The guest OS must first be provisioned using Virtualizat=
ion.framework;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0the disk images can subsequently be used in Qemu. (=
See docs.)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Previous versions of this series also included the macOS PV graphics<b=
r>
&gt; device (&quot;apple-gfx&quot;); those patches have already been merged=
, so<br>
&gt; the title has been changed. Previous iteration:<br>

41223221645.29911-1-phil@philjordan.eu/</a><br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Furthermore, the XHCI fixes and workaround were previously submitted<b=
r>
&gt; as a separate patch set, of which a few patches have also been merged.=

41227121336.25838-1-phil@philjordan.eu/</a><br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Finally, I&#39;ve included one of Philippe Mathieu-Daud=C3=A9&#39;s GI=
Cv3 patches<br>
&gt; which arose out of the discovery that the software GICv3 dependency<br=
