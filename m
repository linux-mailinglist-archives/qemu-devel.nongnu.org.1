Ok. I think it a bug earlier in this patch set. A table dump would confirm.

One item that looks dodgy is the filling in of the ACPI HID.

It's messy in the ACPI spec as it's defined as both an integer
and a string.
 
Need to take a 4 character string and get it into hid of

struct {
   uint64_t hid;
   uint32_t uid;
}
which id done with an 8 byte memcpy.
that is then written to SRAT wtih
build_append_int_noprefix(table_data, handle->hid, 8);

So I need to byte swap it if host doesn't match guest endian.

I'll put together a patch, but perhaps best plan is if Michael
drops generic ports and we go around again :(

At least I don't have much backed up behind this one.
