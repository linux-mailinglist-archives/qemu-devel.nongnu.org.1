I don't think we should over-think the upstream Rust support tiers for QEMU.
Rust is one of very few OSS projects that bothers to classify platforms
they target to this degree of detail. Most OSS projects will test primarily
on Linux, and x86_64 / aarch64, with most everything else done on an adhoc
basis, relying on user feedback & patches. eg If I look at what Rust says

  "Tier 3 targets are those which the Rust codebase has support
   for, but which the Rust project does not build or test
   automatically, so they may or may not work."

I would say that describes the status of most non-Linux / non-x86/arm64
platform combinations, across a very large part of the OSS software
ecosystem, including a lot of libraries QEMU depends on.

Admittedly, compilers are the area where platform support is taken most
seriously, given they are the foundation for everything else above, and
the comparison benchmark in this case is the support matrix offered by
GCC + CLang combined which is incredibly broad. Above that though, QEMU
has a mandatory dep on Glib, and its supported & tested platform set
is massively narrower than this.

I think it is inevitable that a number of QEMU platforms we can build
on will be classified Tier 2 or even 3 by Rust upstream, as just many
libraries QEMU depends on today would effectively be "Tier 3" if their
upstream actually tried to document such details.

What I think is more important than the absolute Tier level, is whether
Rust has been ported at all to a given OS + arch combination. This is
where tier 3 guides us - an indication that there's been enough interest
in Rust for it to have been ported to that target at some point, and thus
an expectation (or hope) that it can be kept working, if there are
sufficient people downstream who care about that particular Rust target.

In terms of QEMU upstream, we actively test FreeBSD on x86_64 in Gitlab
CI, via Cirrus, and to a slightly lesser extent test OpenBSD/NetBSD on
x86_64 with our adhoc VM environments. Anything else is delegated to
downstream users of QEMU to report bugs to us, though we try not to
take code that would obviously break other platforms even if we can't
test it ourselves. In Rust, the other BSDs are Tier 3 which is weaker
than QEMU aims for x86_64, but on a par with QEMU for non-x86

  https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/platform-support/netbsd.html
  https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/platform-support/openbsd.html

at least they have a designated developer who presumably aims to keep
those rust ports working over time.

I don't think being "Tier 2" is a problem - that is still a pretty strong
level of support from upstream Rust

  https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/target-tier-policy.html#tier-2-target-policy

Beyond that, I don't think any of the upstream Rust tiers are neccessarily
a constraint for QEMU, even Tier 3.

IMHO what matters more is whether the OS distro in question has managed
to successfully package Rust + its stdlib in their distro, to the extent
that QEMU is able to build, using the distro provided packages.

That is the bar we have for basically every dependency we add to QEMU.
Distro support is more important that upstream support. The upstream
support is really more of an indication of how hard a life the distro
maintainer is going to have keeping it working in their distro, rather
than whether QEMU should/should not use it.

With regards,
Daniel
