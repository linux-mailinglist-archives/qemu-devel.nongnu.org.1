All the arguments passed to the command here are defined in CXL spec. I
will add reference to the spec.

Based on the spec, for LD-FAM (Fabric attached memory represented as
logical device), host id is the LD-ID of the host interface to which
the capacity is being added. LD-ID is a unique number (16-bit) assigned
to a host interface.

The encoding is from the specification, and we do not invent anything
here. It is stable and all the updates to the spec need to be backward
compatible.

--------------------------------
For add command, saying a user sends a request to FM to ask to add
extent A of the device (managed by FM) to host 0.
The function cxl-add-dynamic-capacity simulates what FM needs to do.
1. Verify extent A is valid (behaviour defined by the spec), return
error if not; otherwise,
2. Add a record to the device's event log (indicating the intent to
add extent A to host 0), update device internal extent tracking status,
signal an interrupt to host 0;
(The above step 1 & 2 are performed in the QMP interface, following
operations are QMP irrelevant, only host and device involved.)
3. Once the interrupt is received, host 0 fetch the event record from
the device's event log through some mailbox command (out of scope
of this patch series).
4. Host 0 decides whether it accepts extent A or not. Whether accept or
reject, host needs to send a response (add-response mailbox command) to
the device so the device can update its internal extent tracking
status accordingly.
The device return a value to the host showing whether the response is
successful or failed.
5. Based on the mailbox command return value, the host process
accordingly.
6. The host sends a mailbox command to the device to clear the event
record in the device's event log. 

---------------------------------
For release command, saying a user sends a request to FM to ask host 0
to release extent A and return it back to the device (managed by FM).

The function cxl-release-dynamic-capacity simulates what FM needs to do.
1. Verify extent A is valid (defined by the spec), return error if not;
otherwise,
2. Add a record to the event log (indicating the intent to
release extent A from host 0), signal an interrupt to host 0;
(The above step 1 & 2 are performed in the QMP interface, following
operations are QMP irrelevant, only host and device involved.
3. Once the interrupt is received, host 0 fetch the event record from
the device's event log through some mailbox command (out of scope
of this patch series).
4. Host 0 decides whether it can release extent A or not. Whether can or
cannot release, host needs to send a release (mailbox command) to the device
so the device can update its internal extent tracking status accordingly.
The device returns a value to host 0 showing whether the release is
successful or failed.
5. Based on the returned value, the host process accordingly.
6. The host sends mailbox command to clear the event record in the
device's event log. 

For release command, it is more complicated. Based on the release flag
passed to FM, FM can behaviour differently. For example, if the
forced-removal flag is set, FM can directly get the extent back from a
host for other uses without waiting for the host to send command to the
device. For the above step 2, their may be not event record to the event
log (no supported in this patch series yet).

Also, for the release interface here, it simulates FM initializes the
release request.
There is another case where the host can proactively release extents it
do not need any more back to device. However, this case is out of the
scope of this release interface.

Hope the above text helps a little for the context here.
Let me know if further clarification is needed.

Fan
