I see vague references (with unfortunately 404 links) to FreeBSD
supporting some ICH watchdogs, which might mean it is compatible
with the q35 built-in watchdog that all x86 q35 machines get by
default. That wouldn't help non-x86 BSD though.

Off-list, Richard Jones pointed to the ACPI Watchdog WADT specification
from Microsoft which appears to the most viable solution for Windows
guests - at least from x86 POV, but hopefully any future Wndows aarch64
too:

  https://download.microsoft.com/download/a/f/7/af7777e5-7dcd-4800-8a0a-b18336565f5b/HardwareWDTSpec.doc

The ACPI watchdog sounds like potentially the best bet for a working
solution across Linux and Windows, on any arch that does ACPI.... if
we can just find someone to write a QEMU driver for it....

With regards,
Daniel
