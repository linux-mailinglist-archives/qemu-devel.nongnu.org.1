Sure. A separate pmu flag that enables all available pmu related
extensions - Correct ?
Do you prefer to have those enabled via a separate preferred rule or
just reuse the implied
rule ? I can drop the preferred rule patches for the later case.

Yeah. But given the optionality in profiles, I am sure if it will fix
the ever growing
extension dependency graph problem ;)

If everybody thinks max CPU is going to be used more frequently in the
future, I am okay with
that as well. Implied rule will only specify mandatory extensions
defined by ISA.

It's up to the user to figure out the extensions names and enable them
individually if max CPU
is not used.
FYI: There are at least 6 more PMU related extensions that this series
did not specify.
~4 are being discussed in the RVI TG(precise event sampling, events)
and 2 are frozen (Smctr/Ssctr)
