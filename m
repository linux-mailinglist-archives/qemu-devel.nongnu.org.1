AFAIKS u-boot provides a default environment if the CRC does not match.

If all-zeros env was created with correct CRC, IMO it should be
accepted.

Does u-boot write back a default environment or corrected CRC to NVRAM
if it was missing/bad?

Okay. It would still be better to add QEMU options to docs/ files and
point the amiga pages to that rather than the other way around, since
this is QEMU specific stuff. Doc in cover letter unfortunately is
not very good since it  just gets lost.

Hmm, the u-boot default env (before it was removed) selected

Right, you can just rewrite it a bit simpler to have only one exit point
and only do the blk_pwrite once etc I think (although my version might
have had a bug it was a bit hasty but you get the idea).
