The RFC version was posted more than 2 months ago.

It has received some review comments from multiple people,
all of which were addressed in this patch set version.

I have not received any further comments during these 2 months, so I thought
the overall design is considered okay - if anything, there might be minor
code comments/issues but these can easily be improved/fixed in the 5 weeks
remaining to the soft code freeze for 9.1.


If anything, I think that the VM live phase (non-downtime) transfers
functionality should be deferred until 9.2 because:
* It wasn't a part of the RFC so even if implemented today would get much
less testing overall,

* It's orthogonal to the switchover time device state transfer functionality
introduced by this patch set and could be added on top of that without
changing the wire protocol for switchover time device state transfers,

* It doesn't impact the switchover downtime so in this case 9.1 would
already contain all what's necessary to improve it.


Thanks,
Maciej
