Hi, Daniel.

Do we have any plans to support virt-io on the rvsp-ref machine in the future?

Recently, I have been using the RISC-V reference platform built on this set of
patches to support running the OpenEuler RISC-V operating system.

I will actively feed back any test results to the upstream.

Thanks,
Chao
