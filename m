I admittedly had some difficulty articulating the change introduced by
this patch.  The @deprecated-props array, as well as a way for s390x to
populate it, was introduced in release 9.1.  Prior to this patch, the
deprecated-props list was filtered by the CPU model's full feature set.
I attempted to explain this with:

"Since 9.1, the list of deprecated props were always a subset of the
model's full-definition list of properties."

This patch modifies what is populated in the list by filtering it via an
intersection of the model's /default/ feature set.  The reason for this
change was that the deprecated-props list reported for very old s390
models was showing features that were not *actually* a subset of the
model's feature set.  One of the changes proposed by this patch corrects
this for static model expansions.  Explained by:

"Now, this list is populated with the model's enabled property set when
delta changes are applied."

The other change introduced by this patch is that the entire list of
deprecated-properties is now reported via a full model expansion,
explained by:

"All deprecated properties are reported otherwise."

My thoughts were to acknowledge this change in case a user sees
different results between QEMU versions.  However, as this
@deprecated-props thing is relatively new (a few months), perhaps it
does not make sense to include this note?  What would you suggest?

Forgot about the 70 rule for these docs.  Missed the double space.
Thanks for reminding me.  Will update.
