This isn't anything to do with the distro installer. The use case is that
the distro wants all its software to be able to run on the x86_64 baseline
it has chosen to build with.

If we want to use POPCNT in the TCG code, can we not do a runtime check
and selectively build pieces of code with  __attribute__((target("popcnt"))),
as we've done historically for the bufferiszero.c code, rather than
changing the entire QEMU baseline ?


With regards,
Daniel
