Aha understand.

For simplicity, let's consider case, when source "cluster size" = "job cluster size" = "bitmap granularity" = "target cluster size".

Which types of clusters we should consider, when we want to handle guest write?

1. Clusters, that should be copied by background process

These are dirty clusters from user-given bitmap, or if we do a full-disk mirror, all clusters, not yet copied by background process.

For such clusters we simply ignore the unaligned write. We can even ignore the aligned write too: less disturbing the guest by delays.

2. Clusters, already copied by background process during this mirror job and not dirtied by guest since this time.

For such clusters we are safe to do unaligned write, as target cluster must be allocated.

3. Clusters, not marked initially by dirty bitmap.

What to do with them? We can't do unaligned write. I see two variants:

- do additional read from source, to fill the whole cluster, which seems a bit too heavy

- just mark the cluster as dirty for background job. So we behave like in "background" mode. But why not? The maximum count of such "hacks" is limited to number of "clear" clusters at start of mirror job, which means that we don't seriously affect the convergence. Mirror is guaranteed to converge anyway. And the whole sense of "write-blocking" mode is to have a guaranteed convergence. What do you think?


----

Of course, we can't distinguish 3 types by on dirty bitmap, so we need the second one. For example "done_bitmap", where we can mark clusters that were successfully copied. That would be a kind of block-status of target image. But using bitmap is a lot better than querying block-status from target.

OK right, I was misunderstanding bitmap-mode for mirror. Now I understand.
