Eric just asked me about the i6300ESB on ARM and Windows.
Windows has i6300ESB device PNP ID in machine.inf:
%WatchdogTimer_Desc% =3D NO_DRV, PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_25AB
NO_DRV means that there is no device driver installed for the device,
but the device will have some "Friendly Name" in the device manager
and will be treated as installed device. Users could then install
Intel's driver.

Changing the device ID, will make this device as not-installed from
Windows perspective. If such device will be included by default for
some machine types, those machine types will not be able to pass
Microsoft SVVP certification because the OS will have a device without
a driver. The mitigation is to keep and certify our own dummy INF,
which is a grey zone as Intel should have their own driver certified
with MS.
This is very similar to the discussion we had about AMD IOMMU PCIe
endpoint PNP Id.

Best regards,
Yan.
