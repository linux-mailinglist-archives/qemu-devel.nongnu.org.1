This has already picked up, thanks for pointing out. Will remove in the

Yes, imagine your CLIDR register describes L1, L2, and L3. Then in the
interface we only describe L1, and L2 and leave L3. Situation for L3 
right now is undefined, in a sense that what is the sharing situation?
This is failure.

I think this is applicable to both TCG and KVM, because, the miss-match
might come from real systems' registers or emulated ones. User might
not exactly know the supported caches and misconfigure.

I spend some time thinking about a default behavior but then that
again will be unclear to users, and decided it is better if users
decide what EXACTLY should happen in an informed fashion.

Short answer, I think I am better off sending upgrades once the main
patchset got merged.

Some of these TODOs are good to have really, i.e., L3 size is something
I have received some interest about already.

Or separated data and instruction is interesting only if someone plans
to build one (maybe there is already and I don't know).

Or arbitrary levels is not a challenging mod, so can be added later,
if people want to have 7 layers :)

This is something community can help me knowing what else might be
interesting.
