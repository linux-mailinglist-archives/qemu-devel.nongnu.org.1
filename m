Sometimes sed can do wonders (or break completely) but maybe it can turn a 
-hda filename option into -drive if=virtio,file=filename if you can't fix 
hda for some machines.

I think this originates from lilo which had an append option to specify 
options to append to kernel command line and then had addappend to append 
more options to that... QEMU only took the append which like in lilo 
overrides earlier instances despite what its name might suggest.

The commit explains why this was a security issue. Making -hda only accept 
raw would also less inconvenient and would have changed how it worked 
before so I think this solution was chose to preserve as much 
functionality as possible.

Patches are welcome, I guess. Originally QEMU had a less options and they 
were simple. If you look at -help it still says:

usage: qemu-system-x86_64 [options] [disk_image]

'disk_image' is a raw hard disk image for IDE hard disk 0

So in the simplest form you can just pass a disk image to boot without any 
options but not sure it still works.

But later QEMU got more complex and this needed more complex options. Then 
a lot of the mess in the command line came from that it needs to serve 
both users and management apps which require low level control for 
everything and these apps took over QEMU for a while, that's how a lot of 
non-user friendly options crept in and then user friendly options were 
changed to be high level wrappers on those low level ones to avoid having 
two independent set of options for the same thing but maybe this was not 
always done and there's still room to improve. Also having those 
management apps meant less people cared about user friendly options and 
just used those apps instead.
