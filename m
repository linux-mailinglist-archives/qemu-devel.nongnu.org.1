To me, what SDM describes are ambiguous and misleading. It has

- EBX[23:16]: Maximum number of addressable IDs for logical processors
               in this physical package.

- The nearest power-of-2 integer that is not smaller than EBX[23:16]:
	      The number of unique initial APIC IDs reserved for
               addressing different logical processors in a physical
               package.

To me, the latter is much more equal to what you called "the maximum 
capacity of addressable ID".

Anyway, as what SDM describes are confusing (at least to me), and based 
on the real value modern Intel CPUs report, I won't argue against it 
anymore.

However, back to the patch, I think we cannot change it as this patch 
directly. Instead, we need a compat_props for the changed behavior, 
because this isn't a bug fix and it introduces guest-visible differences.

For ancient Intel CPUs, EBX[23:16] did represent the number of Logical 
processor per package. I believe this should be the reason why QEMU 
implemented it as is:

   - on SDM version 013, EBX[23:16]: Number of logical processors per 
physical processor; two for the Pentium 4 processor supporting 
Hyper-Threading Technology.

   - on SDM version 015, it changed to: Number of initial APIC IDs 
reserved for this physical package. Normally, this is the number of 
logical processors per physical package.

   - on SDM version 016, it changed to: Maximum number of logical 
processors in this physical package.

   - finally, starting from SDM version 026, it changed to what reads 
now: Maximum number of addressable IDs for logical processors in this 
physical package.
