The original motivation of the proposed fxied0 and fixed1 data is to 
complement the CPUID configurability report, which is important for 
userspace. E.g., Currently, what QEMU is doing is hardcoding the fixed0 
and fixed1 information of a specific TDX release to adjust the 
KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID result and gets a final "supported" CPUID set 
for TDX. Hardcoding is not a good idea and it's better that KVM can get 
the data from TDX module, then pass to userspace (of course KVM can 
tweak the data based on its own requirement). So, do you think it's 
useful to have TDX module report the fixed0/fixed1 data for this purpose?
