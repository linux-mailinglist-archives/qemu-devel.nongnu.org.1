Fully qualified name.

If lookup succeeds, we're done.

If lookup fails, we're also done.

*Except* for the ambiguous form NAMESPACE:MYSTERY.  If lookup fails for
that, the name is not fully qualified after all.  Probably.  Maybe.  We
assume it's missing a module, and proceed to 2.

I'm mostly ignoring this exception from now on to keep things simple.

> 2. FQN using contextual info

Partially qualified name, but context can fill the gaps.

If lookup succeeds, we're done.

Else, we proceed to 3.

While we should try to put this on a more solid foundation, it is not a

We skipped 1. because not fully qualified, and we skipped 2. because
context can't fill the gaps.

Yes.

We skipped 1. because not fully qualified, and we failed 2. because

Got it.

Detail I had not considered until now: a namespace contains modules that
contain definitions, but it also contains definitions directly.

I can't recall offhand how schema.py represents this.  I'll figure it
out and report back.
