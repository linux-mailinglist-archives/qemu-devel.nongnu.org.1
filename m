>
> Since, cluster (for ARM/riscv) lacks a comprehensive and rigorous

> [2] when it was introduced by QEMU, x86 module is very similar to
> general smp.clusters: they are all a layer above existing core level
> to organize the physical cores and share L2 cache.

> However, after digging deeper into the description and use cases of
> cluster in the device tree [3], I realized that the essential
> difference between clusters and modules is that cluster is an extremely
> abstract concept:
>   * Cluster supports nesting though currently QEMU doesn't support
>     nested cluster topology. However, modules will not support nesting.
>   * Also due to nesting, there is great flexibility in sharing resources
>     on clusters, rather than narrowing cluster down to sharing L2 (and
>     L3 tags) as the lowest topology level that contains cores.
>   * Flexible nesting of cluster allows it to correspond to any level
>     between the x86 package and core.
>
> Based on the above considerations, and in order to eliminate the naming
> confusion caused by the mapping between general cluster and x86 module
> in v7, we now formally introduce smp.modules as the new topology level.
>
>
> Where to Place Module in Existing Topology Levels
> =================================================
>
> The module is, in existing hardware practice, the lowest layer that
> contains the core, while the cluster is able to have a higher topological
> scope than the module due to its nesting.
>
> Thereby, we place the module between the cluster and the core, viz:

> Additional Consideration on CPU Topology
> ========================================

> Beyond this patchset, nowadays, different arches have different topology
> requirements, and maintaining arch-agnostic general topology in SMP

>   * It becomes difficult to put together all CPU topology hierarchies of

>   * It also becomes complex to ensure the correctness of the topology

>       - Now the max_cpus is calculated by multiplying all topology

Have you considered putting an abridged version of your lovely rationale
into a commit message, so it can be found later more easily?
