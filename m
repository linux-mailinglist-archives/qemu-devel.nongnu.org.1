For OVMF guests: yes, said deprecation should be safe.

Note however that the "current_cpu" case (the original case) had been in
place minimally for SeaBIOS. I don't know how exactly the deprecation /
removal in QEMU would work, but if you build SeaBIOS with
CONFIG_USE_SMM, it might still depend on the "current_cpu" branch.

FWIW, "roms/config.seabios-128k" and "roms/config.seabios-microvm" both
contain CONFIG_USE_SMM=n, so the deprecation likely wouldn't matter for
those SeaBIOS binaries (bundled with QEMU). But it could matter for
SeaBIOS binaries from other sources; plus "roms/config.seabios-256k"
does *not* contain a setting like that (and the SeaBIOS default is "y",
when building for QEMU).

For another data point: as far as I remember, we had disabled
CONFIG_USE_SMM in RHEL; there had been stability issues.

... I can't describe *all* the uses that SeaBIOS has for SMM. *One* use
is from commit 55215cd425d3 ("Implement call32 mechanism using SMIs.",
2014-10-15) -- "this allows SeaBIOS to transition to 32bit mode even
when called in vm86 mode". Because that commit modifies "stacks.c", I
think it must be related to the "cooperative multi-tasking system"
described here: <https://www.seabios.org/Execution_and_code_flow#Threads>.

I'm really rusty on this [*], but here's one potential symptom I can
theorize about: assuming you silently make broadcast SMI the default in
QEMU, and SeaBIOS raises an SMI (expecting it to only affect the BSP),
the SMI could become pending on all the APs (which would all be in RESET
state at that point [**]). And when Linux booted those APs with
INIT-SIPI-SIPI sequences, the pending SMIs could be delivered
immediately, and the APs would launch immediately into SMM. That would
likely not be expected.

[*] Using earlier edk2 commit cbccf995920a ("OvmfPkg/CpuHotplugSmm: fix
CPU hotplug race just after SMI broadcast", 2020-08-27) as cheat-sheet.
IIRC, I consulted the Intel SDM extensively back when I was working on
that patch.

[**] Hm... wait. It seems SeaBIOS does boot all APs in the system. The
APs apparently end up penned in a HLT-loop; see at the end of
"entry_smp" in "romlayout.S". In that case, the problem could be worse I
guess? The broadcast SMI could wake all APs from their halted states.
SeaBIOS doesn't seem to relocate SMBASE for the APs, so if multiple
processors start executing in SMM at the same time, the results are not
going to be stellar.
