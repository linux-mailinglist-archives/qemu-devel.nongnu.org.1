Broadly speaking the legal risks are unclear. The challenge from Paolo
though is there are some usage scenarios where the legal risks are
negligible, even in today's murky situation wrt training material
license laundering

The simplicity of the current rule is very appealing, but at the same time
I find it hard to justify why we should reject usage in some of these
scenarios.

So we have a choice of deciding we're going to accept the collatoral
damage of rejecting what are almost certainly low risk contributions,
or tolerate a little more complexity in our policy via exceptions.

I'm willing to entertain the idea of exceptions, as long as we don't
make it too onerous for our maintainers to evaluate patches with a
reasonable consistency across our different maintainers.

Something should be able to pass an obvious & simple "sniff test" to
be able to qualify under an exception. If we find ourselves having
to debate & ponder applicability, then the exception would be unworkable.

With regards,
Daniel
