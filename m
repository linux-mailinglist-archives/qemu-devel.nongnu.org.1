In a BYOF world it's even useful without SVSM at all, because the launch 
digest performs measurement for you, but you still want to find your 
boot variables.

MacOS takes over the full physical address map past ExitBootServices: 
Your code no longer has VA access to random code and it literally 
memcpy()'s all preserved (virtual available) code and data to different 
physical addresses. You simply have nothing that is all of 1) RAM 
(mapped as cacheable on ARM), 2) known VA 3) known PA.

So we really really need a fallback mechanism that works without DMA :).
