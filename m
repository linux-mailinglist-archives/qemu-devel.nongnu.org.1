For Linux maybe OK to not have name but other OSes use it to identify 
devices so we need it. I tried to match what the real pegasos firmware 
returns but likely SLOF does the same if you do .properties in a node, I 
have not tried SLOF but I can try if that helps. I've seen some 
OpenFirmware output from Macs which also have name in property list and OF 
specification says each node should have a name property so I think it's 
not OK to skip it and not returning it from nextprop does not work for 
pegasos which now has to add explicit name properties in pegasos2.c to fix 
this.

Is that good or bad? Was it firing before? If so, getting rid of it may be 
good but I can leave phandle there if it helps Linux. Other OSes don't 
seem to care but it does not seem to appear on real OF results that's why 
I also removed it but I could leave it in if you think it's better that 
way.

Sorry I did not make it clear this is for 10.1 not 10.0, that's why it 
does not say what does it fix. I want to clean up pegasos2.c a bit after 
the freeze and this allows me to remove all the explicit name properties 
which are now only needed because while the name property works with 
getprop, it is not queried due to missing from nextprop. I've just 
submitted this patch in advance to get it reviewed and hopefully merged 
after the freeze so I can submit the patches that depend on it later. I 
don't have any fixes for 10.0 so that should be fine for now, these are 
for after the freeze.

BALATON Zoltan
