Dear QEMU developer team

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Mohammad Javad Sekonji, and I
am a master=E2=80=99s student specializing in electronic digital systems. I=
 am
currently working on a project involving the installation and operation of
a Linux operating system (preferably Debian Sid) on a custom RISC-V64
architecture with specific hardware modifications. My goal is to use QEMU
to emulate the system and compare its performance and behavior to the
standard RISC-V64 architecture.

I have successfully completed a similar process for a standard RISC-V64
setup and am familiar with the general workflow. However, I would like to
confirm whether it is technically feasible to implement such a setup on a
customized RISC-V64 architecture and, if so, to understand any additional
considerations or steps that might be required for this process.

To provide more context about the customizations I am planning:

   - *Architectural level:* I am considering replacing the standard
   architecture with variations such as RISC-V BOOM, 2-stage pipelines,
   5-stage pipelines, Rocket, and similar designs.
   - *Microarchitectural level:* I am exploring modifications to components
   like the branch predictor and other similar elements.

Given these planned changes, I would be grateful if you could share your
thoughts on any specific considerations or potential challenges I should
anticipate. Additionally, if there are resources or examples you recommend
for implementing such customizations and conducting performance
comparisons, they would be immensely helpful.

Given your expertise in embedded systems and related areas, I was hoping to
seek your guidance on the matter or any relevant resources you might
recommend. Your insight would be invaluable to the success of this project.

Thank you very much for your time and assistance. Please let me know if you
need any additional details about the project. I look forward to your
response.

Best regards,
Mohammad Javad Sekonji
Master=E2=80=99s Student of Electronic Digital Systems
