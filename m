I believe the latest attempt was Peter's "[PATCH v3 0/4] qapi/migration:
Dedup migration parameter objects and fix tls-authz crash" last
September.

I can't recall offhand what exactly blocked its merge.  Suggest you read
the review thread[*], and if that leads to questions, ask them either in
replies to the old thread, or right here.

One additional issue hasn't been discussed much so far, I think: merging
the two copies of the doc comments.  They are big and quite similar
(that's why we want to deduplicate), but they're not identical.  In
particular, MigrationSetParameters' doc comment talks more about
defaults.  That's because talking about defaults makes no sense
whatsoever for MigrationParameters (we do it anyway, of course, just
less).  Merging the two will require some careful word-smithing, and
perhaps some compromises on doc quality.
