Wouldn't this be solved by splitting off the EDK2 version QEMU needs into 
a separate project (something like qemu-edk2) and make that a separate 
dependency?

Having blobs is a big conveniece that would be preferable to keep as most 
of the time people don't need to rebuild blobs if they just want to run a 
machine and even if changing a machine they don't need to touch the 
firmware so it's only a few people who may want to install cross compilers 
or a container to rebuild blobs and it would be nice to save others that 
hassle.

It should be clearly documented which is not always the case and in those 
cases existing examples are taken as documentation. So where there is a 
preferred API that should be in the documentation or if it's already there 
should somehow be more organised so it's easier to find and refer to in 
reviews.

This may have been sparked by some of the debates we had with Mark. In one 
review 
[https://patchew.org/QEMU/cover.1758219840.git.balaton@eik.bme.hu/b5b4558125e2408ded29f7cdc306011358829044.1758219840.git.balaton@eik.bme.hu/] 
he proposed memory region callbacks to take device state as opaque data 
then QOM cast these to get the memory region, parent object or field the 
callbacks need. I argued that there's no such convention documented 
anywhere and what the opaque pointer should be is defined by the callbacks 
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)#Callbacks_(C)] 
so it makes sense to pass a the data it needs to the callback and not the 
whole device state. Also the opaque data is registered once typically in 
an init or realize function where it's already known it's the right type 
so within the callback (which can potentially be called often) there is no 
need to type check and cast it every time again. So opaque asignments in 
the callback can assume the right type without casting and I don't think 
it would bring any advantage to restrict the type to device state for 
callbacks that would only make them unnecessarily more complex. This isn't 
documented so can lead to different people following different views. Also 
sometimes new conventions are only agreed on the list but not documented 
so who missed the discussion won't know about it.

I would like to raise another point here: PPC maintainership. Is there an 
active maintainer for PPC currently? The one who is listed in MAINTAINERS 
does not seem to be active and nobody seems to review and merge patches I 
submit for PPC which already resulted in missing one release and the next 
one may be the second release my series miss because of this. Is the 
project aware of this and somebody is taking care of it?

Regards,
BALATON Zoltan
