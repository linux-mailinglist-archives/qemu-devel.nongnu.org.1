I could have sworn we had an example of how to handle this already,
but I'm not finding any Device class with a non-scalar property
that isn't merely an array of scalars.

We definitely have some examples elsewhere for exmaple "Machine" class
has an SmpCacheProperties array property, and the QAuthZList class
has an array of "QAuthZListRule" property.

In both cases the struct is defined in th qapi/<blah>.json, which
auto-generates code eg visit_type_QAuthZListRuleList, which can
then get called from qauthz_list_prop_get_rules and
qauthz_list_prop_set_rules, for the property.

Devices use a slightly higher level wrapper so instead of calling
object_class_property_add directly, then define the PropertyInfo
and object_class_property_add gets called indirectly for them.
I'm thinking it should still be possible to use the QAPI code
generator to help though. You could either just define the struct,
and thn use that to create  PropertyInfo to be used in combination
with DEFINE_PROP_ARRAY, of you could define a list of structs at
the QAPI level and use plain DEFINE_PROP. I guess the former is
probably better aligned with other Device code.
