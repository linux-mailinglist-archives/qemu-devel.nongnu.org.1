Yes, I suppose I can see it from that point of view provided that the 
advanced features of GStreamer, such as user defined audio graphs, are 
never exposed to the user to configure. I can just imagine the false bug 
report nightmare this would induce (buggy plugins, etc).

Yes, this is the primary issue here. I believe that solving this is more 
complicated then it appears however as headless systems that are using 
SPICE for audio wont have an audio clock to sync to.

Note that I am referring to a SPICE client that only subscribes to the 
audio stream and not video, as is the case for Looking Glass as it uses 
an out of band mechanism to obtain the passthrough GPUs output. This is 
also occurs on the local host via a unix socket.

I do not think this aspect can be solved in QEMU, but rather must be 
solved in the SPICE client

See here if you're interested how we did this:
https://github.com/gnif/LookingGlass/blob/53bfb6547f2b7abd6c183192e13a57068c1677ea/client/src/audio.c

In that case, i'd suggest that if possible the GStreamber back end 
maintains the same port and node names it presents to Jack/PipeWire to 
make the transition from the other audio backends to GStreamer as 
painless as possible.

Great, as long as we don't let user's configure GStreamer's more 
advanced features its should be ok then.
