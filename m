Fixed.  There's another similar occurance in the last patch, I'll fix that
too.

Correct on both.

Not with the current API.

Right now, the reported values are per-vCPU average latencies and global
average latencies, not yet per-vCPU fault counts. Per-vCPU fault counts
will be needed to do the calculation.

I chose to export global average latency only because that should be the
most important one to me as of now.  The per-vCPU results are pretty much
side effect of how blocktime feature does accounting so far (which is based
on per-vCPU), so it's very low hanging fruit.
