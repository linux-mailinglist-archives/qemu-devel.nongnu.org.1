There's nothing unusual here that I know of. Configure line is just
--target-list=x86_64-softmmu --enable-debug --disable-docs --disable-plugins.

It's not that page faults happen during multifd. The page was already
sent during precopy, but multifd-recv didn't write to it, it just marked
the receivedmap. When postcopy starts, the page gets accessed and
faults. Since postcopy is on, the migration wants to request the page
from the source, but it's present in the receivedmap, so it doesn't
ask. No page ever comes and the code hangs waiting for the page fault to
be serviced (or potentially faults continuously? I'm not sure on the
details).

That's reasonable. But I won't be available for the next two
weeks. Peter is going to be back in the meantime, let's hear what he has
to say about this postcopy issue. I'll provide my r-bs.

Only the TLS part. The CI is failing with just this series. I didn't
change anything there. Maybe there's a bug in the userfaultfd detection?
I'll leave it to you, here's the error:
