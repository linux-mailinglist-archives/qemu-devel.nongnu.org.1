Hello Michael and Peter,

Exactly, not so compelling, as I did it first only on servers widely
used for production in our data center. The network adapters are

Ethernet controller: Broadcom Inc. and subsidiaries NetXtreme BCM5720
2-port Gigabit Ethernet PCIe
InfiniBand controller: Mellanox Technologies MT27800 Family [ConnectX-5]

which doesn't meet our purpose. I can choose RDMA or TCP for VM
migration. RDMA traffic is through InfiniBand and TCP through Ethernet
on these two hosts. One is standby while the other is active.

Now I'll try on a server with more recent Ethernet and InfiniBand
network adapters. One of them has:
BCM57414 NetXtreme-E 10Gb/25Gb RDMA Ethernet Controller (rev 01)

The comparison between RDMA and TCP on the same NIC could make more sense.

Best regards,
Yu Zhang @ IONOS Cloud
