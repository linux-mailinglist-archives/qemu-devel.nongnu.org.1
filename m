I'm not really familiar with the finer details of this throttling code,
but this doesn't look like a proper fix for a race to me. If it was
possible for a timer to be scheduled between the caller and here, then
it can certainly also be scheduled between your new check and whatever
relies on the condition after it.

If I understand the commit message of 25b8e4db7f3 correctly, the idea is
that you never have a timer pending that wouldn't actually restart a
request. If the timer is rescheduled from a different thread right after
this check, we'll already resume all of the requests now and the timer
will still be pending without actually having any work to do.

So it looks to me like we'll need some extended locking (tg->lock is
already held by callers of throttle_group_schedule_timer(), but only for
a short duration in throttle_group_restart_queue_entry() instead of
during the whole process), or just give up on the invariant, but then we
don't have to return early either.

Berto, any thoughts?

Kevin
