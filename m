to be nice we can deprecate those and then later remove.
(while deprecating make those targets accept typenames)

with PPC using 'true' aliases, -cpu input is lost after it's translated int=
o typename.
(same for alpha)

it also adds an extra fun with 'max' cpu model but that boils down to above=
 statement.
(same for
  * sh4
  * cris(in user mode only, but you are making sysemu extension, so it does=
n't count)
)
For this class of aliases reverse translation won't yield the same
result as used -cpu. The only option you have is to store -cpu cpu_model
somewhere (use qemu_opts??, and then fetch it later to print in error messa=
ge)

x86 has 'aliases' as well, but in reality it creates distinct cpu types
for each 'alias', so it's possible to do reverse translation.

yep, that's the gist of deprecation in this case.=20

instead of per target hooks (which are atm mostly open-coded in several pla=
ces)
how about adding generic handler for cases 2,4:
  cpu_type_to_model(typename)
     cpu_suffix =3D re'-*-cpu'
     if (class_exists(typename - cpu_suffix))
         return typename - cpu_suffix
     else if (class_exists(typename))
         return typename
     explode

that should work for translating valid_cpus typenames to cpumodel names
and once that in place cleanup all open-coded translations with it tree-wide

you can find those easily by:
git grep _CPU_TYPE_SUFFIX
git grep query_cpu_definitions
