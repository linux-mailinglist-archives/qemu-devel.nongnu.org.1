Historically libvirt primariily uses the 'fd:' protocol, with a
socket FD. It never gives QEMU a plain file FD, since it has
always added its "iohelper" as a MITM, in order to add O_DIRECT
on top.

The 'getfd' command is something that is needed when talking to
QEMU for any API that involves a "SocketAddress" QAPI type,
which is applicable for migration.

With the introduction of 'MigrationAddress', the 'socket' protocol
is backed by 'SocketAddress' and thus supports FD passing for
sockets (or potentally pipes too), in combination with 'getfd'.

With the 'file' protocol in 'MigrationAddress', since it gets
backed by qemu_open(), then /dev/fdset/NN and 'add-fd' provide
passing for plain files.

Daniel
