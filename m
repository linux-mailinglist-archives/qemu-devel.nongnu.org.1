Thanks! I'll do this.

Yes, I agree that it shouldn't be over-optimized.

The logic in the current Rust version is pretty much a carbon copy of
the Python version, without additional complex logic introduced, but the
improvements in x2.6 were obtained by optimizing IO:

* reading the event configuration file, where I called the buffered
  interface,
* and the output formatted trace log, which I output all via std_out.lock()
  followed by write_all().

So, just the simple tweak of the interfaces brings much benefits. :-)

Many thanks! This is a good example and I'll try to build similarly to
it.

Thanks for the suggestion, that's clear to me, I'll try to control the
third party dependencies.

Yes, I can. :-)

Rewriting in Rust does sound duplicative, but I wonder if this could be
viewed as an open opportunity to add Rust support for QEMU, looking at
the scripts directory to start exploring Rust support/build would be
a relatively easy place to start.

I think the exploration of Rust's build of the simpletrace tool under
scripts parts can help with subsequent work on supporting Rust in other
QEMU core parts.

From this point, may I ask your opinion?

Maybe later, Rust-simpletrace and python-simpletrace can differ, e.g.
the former goes for performance and the latter for scalability.

Thanks,
Zhao
