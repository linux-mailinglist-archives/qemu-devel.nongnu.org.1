What is your opinion on that? Patches 2 -12 are dedicated to the move of
isar struct's individual idreg fields to an array. To me , this
anonymous storage looks more generic, scalable and adapted to the way we
retrieve information from KVM. Do you think this is an acceptable
reshuffle of the code and can we envision to push those changes in a
separate prerequisite series that would avoid us to rebase everytime
until we get a solution for named vcpu models?

Thanks
