My point is that a premature termination sets local_err and a
premature_ok=3D=3Dtrue doesn't. So it's not the same as non-TLS migration
because there we don't have a way to ignore any errors.

Multifd recv threads can't discern an EOF in the middle of the migration
from an EOF after all data has been received. The former is definitely
an error and should cause migration to abort, multifd threads to
cleanup, etc.

Even if non-TLS behaved the same, why would we choose to port a bug to
the TLS implementation?

We could of course decide at this point to punt the problem forward and
when it shows up, we'd have to go implement gnutls_bye() to allow the
distinction between good-EOF/bad-EOF or maybe add an extra sync at the
end of migration to make sure the last recv() call is only started after
the source has already shutdown() the channel.

Yes, I think we should keep it.
