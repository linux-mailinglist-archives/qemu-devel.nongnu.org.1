Do you concede that this code has a hidden assumption? Either that
migrate_multifd() != migrate_postcopy_preempt() or that multifd channels
must be set up before postcopy preempt channel? Because that is enough
for us to have to do something about it. Either restructuring or a
comment explaining.

> * When does postcopy preempt channel creation race with the multifd

Well, taking that this is the destination side, I don't think we can
predict when the other end of the migration will open a channel, can we?
For instance, postcopy_do_resume() has this comment:

    /*
     * If preempt is enabled, re-establish the preempt channel.  Note that
     * we do it after resume prepare to make sure the main channel will be
     * created before the preempt channel.  E.g. with weak network, the
     * dest QEMU may get messed up with the preempt and main channels on
     * the order of connection setup.  This guarantees the correct order.
     */

It looks like if the main channel can race, so do the multifd channels,
no?

In any case, I'm fine with just documenting any assumption for now.

Nope, this is just saying whether a single channel is expected, or more
than one. That's why I think it would be a good gate for this peeking
code. Since postcopy preempt could be a peekable channel, it's
misleading to put it all behind QIO_CHANNEL_FEATURE_READ_MSG_PEEK
only. This is a time-bomb for the next person to refactor this code.

Right, but that's not what we have today. Changing this requires
figuring out how to keep the stream compatible when channels now start
sending extra stuff at the start. It's not trivial. There's also
mapped-ram which is asynchronous and there might be something special to
be done about the TLS handshake, I'm not sure.

Well, aside from preempt, they're *not* dependent on the order. That's
the point of having to do all of this dance. In fact we might be better
off if we could serialize the connections somehow.

I havent't followed this series closely, could you point me to the
discussion that led to the channels concept being introduced?

Yes. They *can* be used without multifd. The comment would explain that
at that point in the code, these are the only types possible. So as to
not mislead future readers that whenever tls/file, then multifd must be
used.

See? Multifd mutually exclusive with postcopy preempt. You carried that
assumption (well done), but made it more subtle (not good), since
if/else is by definition showing the relationship between the two while
migration_has_main_and_multifd_channels() makes it hidden under the
multifd check allowing the last return true to happen.

If we're enabling multifd along with postcopy, we need to be aware that
the relationship with preempt might not hold true anymore.

This relies on the fact that the management layer will certainly have
set multifd on both sides of the migration and that multifd will not be
used with postcopy.

That's the entire point I'm making when I ask to not omit the else
clauses. The tls and file channels can be the main channel as well, but
that is never explicit in the code. That uint8 channel = CH_MAIN up
there is doing some heavy-lifting.

Indeed.

We shouldn't rely on the underlying iochannel type. That's why they
expose the QIO_CHANNEL_FEATUREs. It's fine if we double check at that
point that the channels are either file/tls, but that cannot be the
algorithm. The current code can work without relying on it after all and
I don't think your postcopy enablement affects that particular part.

Yes, but let's make it explicit. We have this thing in our minds now. In
6 months time no one remembers anything anymore.

Ok, no one is asking for this to be done in one go. You're free to split
any side efforts into a new series and proceed with that. Having to do
prerequisite work is pretty common.

Do you think this series can work without touching the channel discovery
code? As I said earlier, I'm missing a bit of context, but to me it
seems it cannot.

If instead of this refactoring you want to start working on a model for
consistent channel advertisement, then that's fine. But we'll have to
put this series on hold (which is also fine). It also looks like it
could be considerably more work, although I haven't looked at it in
detail. Granted, it's work that makes sense, instead of the heuristics
we have today.
