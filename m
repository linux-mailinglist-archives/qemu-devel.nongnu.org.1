Moreover, having software developers apply copyright law is about as
smart as having copyright lawyers write mission-critical code.  Both
tasks require education and experience.

Yes!

The boundary between legal and illegal is a superposition of fuzzy,
squiggly lines, one per jurisdiction.

We can only try to approximate it from the legal side.

The tighter we try to approximate, the more risk we take on.

In addition, tighter approximations can be difficult to understand and
apply.

A tradeoff made with competent legal advice.  In addition, it's easy to
understand and apply.

[Strong argument why type annotations are low risk snipped...]

Yup.  Code review takes so much brain capacity that it can impair my
spelling.  Legal reasoning is right out.
