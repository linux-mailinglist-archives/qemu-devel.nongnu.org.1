It remove the indirection level of meson<->cargo<->rustc. I don't have a 
concrete idea on how to tackle this, but if cargo ends up not strictly 
necessary, I don't see why we cannot use one build system.

For flexibility, and for being compatible with more versions.

But I do not want to avoid it, what I am saying is we can do a custom 
build of it instead of linking to the rust toolchain's prebuilt version.

Agreed.

Committing, with an option to opt-out. They are generally not big in 
size. I am not of strong opinion on this one, I'm very open to 
alternatives.

Me too.

Definitely, also it's out of scope for this RFC since we're not writing 
and rules/guidelines yet.

No consequence, I just want to warn anyone peeking into the rust output 
(not the final qemu binary) to expect junk.
