If we keep looking at ->container we'll always see NULL, IIUC, because
either it's removed from its parent MR so it's NULL already, or at some
point it can start to point to a root mr of an address space, where should
also be NULL, afaiu.

If with the assumption of this patch applied, then looks like it's pretty
legal a container MR and the child MRs be finalized in any order when the
owner device is being destroyed.

IIUC the MR should be destined to be invisible until this point, with or
without the fact that mr->container is NULL.  It's because anyone who
references the MR should do memory_region_ref() first, which takes the
owner's refcount.  Here if MR finalize() is reached I think it means the
owner refcount must be zero.  So it looks to me the only possible case when
mr->container is non-NULL is it's used internally like this.  Then it's
invisible and also safe to be detached even if container != NULL.

So.. I wonder whether below would make sense, on top of this existing
patch.
