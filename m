I'll get back to this at the end.

I think I finally know enough to give you constructive feedback.

Your commit messages should answer the questions I had.  Specifically:

* Why are we doing this?  To shorten guest-visible downtime.

* How are we doing this?  We additionally pin memory before entering the
  main loop.  This speeds up the pinning we still do in the main loop.

* Drawback: slower startup.  In particular, QMP becomes
  available later.

* Secondary benefit: main loop responsiveness improves, in particular
  QMP.

* What uses of QEMU are affected?  Only with vhost-vDPA.  Spell out all
  the ways to get vhost-vDPA, please.

* There's a tradeoff.  Show your numbers.  Discuss whether this needs to
  be configurable.

If you can make a case for pinning memory this way always, do so.  If
you believe making it configurable would be a good idea, do so.  If
you're not sure, say so in the cover letter, and add a suitable TODO
comment.

Questions?
