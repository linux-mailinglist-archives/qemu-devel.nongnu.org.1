Thanks for posting it Daniel.

I think your approach is pretty neat, and yes, it's much simpler than 
having any compile time or runtime conditional to deal with that.

When we talked about that on previous thread, I thought the idea was to 
expose *all* the commands to *all* the targets, which I didn't really 
understand, considering we have target specific commands by design.
I understand better where you wanted to go, by extracting concerned 
commands in dedicated files.

The only downside I can see is that some commands have to be there, but 
return an "error, not implemented" at runtime. Fine for me, but some 
people may argue against it.

A concern I might have as well is about how we'll deal if we want to 
hide some commands in the future, based on various criterias 
(is_heterogenenous()?). The mantra "define all, and let the build system 
hide things" mantra means you can only have a single definition existing 
in the binary, by design. But maybe it's not even a real concern, and I 
definitely prefer to see problems before fixing them, so it's definitely 
not blocking this approach.

Overall, if I had to choose, I think I would pick your approach instead 
of the "runtime conditional" route, it's just simpler and saner overall.
I would be happy to see you take ownership on that, as long as we can 
deliver something in the next weeks. I can help on anything as well.

@Markus, @Michael, which approach would you prefer to be followed for QAPI?

Thanks,
Pierrick
