Compat property is definitely one way to go, but I think it's you who more
or less persuaded me that reusing it seems possible! At least I can't yet
think of anything bad if it's ancient unused buffers.

And that's why I was asking about a sane way to describe the "magic
year".. And I was very serious when I said "6 years" to follow the
deprecation of machine types, because it'll be something we can follow to
say when an unused buffer can be obsolete and it could make some sense: if
we will start to deprecate machine types, then it may not make sense to
keep any UNUSED compatible forever, after all.

And we need that ruler to be as accurate as "always 6 years to follow
machine type deprecation procedure", in case someone else tomorrow asks us
something that was only UNUSED since 2018.  We need a rule of thumb if we
want to reuse it, and if all of you agree we can start with this one,
perhaps with a comment above the field (before we think all through and
make it a rule on deprecating UNUSED)?
