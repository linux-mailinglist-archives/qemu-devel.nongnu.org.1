There are a variety of reasons why these LVM commands could fail.
Directly detecting whether or not this is an LVM device, rather
than inferring it from 'lvdisplay' result is a more precise check
which will allow for clearer error reporting IMHO.


Ideally we wouldn't even spawn a process for the resize operation,
but instead call into the device mapper library API. That would
let it work even when the seccomp sandbox is enabled and blocking
process spawning. IME the device mapper API is not too friendly
though, so I didn't want to suggest that as a blocker.

GLib should be using posix_spawn internally on all modern platforms.

Resizing LVM volumes does not sound like a hot code path, so I'm
seeing what performance concerns we would have.
