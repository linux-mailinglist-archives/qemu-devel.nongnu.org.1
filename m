The event status registers dictates the notification path (which log).
So I think that's "informational" here.

Whereas flags is about the specific error. One case where they might be
different is where the Related Event Record Handle is set.
An error might be reported as
1) Several things that were non fatal (each with their own record)
2) In combination they result in a fatal situation (also has it's own record).

The QEMU injection shouldn't restrict these combinations more than the spec
does (which is not at all!).

This same disconnect in error severity is seen in UEFI CPER records for example
where there is a containing record with one severity field, but more specific
parts of record can have lower (or in theory higher) severity.
