Hi Daniel,

Some other projects using Avocado have picked different, non-LTS
versions, to use as their pinned versions.  The consequences of using
rolling releases versus LTS-like releases is not something specific to
one software package IMO.  The suggestion to use LTS was to minimize
the impact on users writing and running tests, while allowing for only
needed fixes or very important features (say supporting a new Python
version) to be addressed.

Agreed.

I think this is a very good way forward.  I don't think anything
(simple tests here) should depend on what they don't need to depend
on.

If meson is capable of doing all that can be done right now, then I
believe you're right.  No reason to use duplicate software.  Now, If
you mean that having "single option" may imply duplicating code that
already exists and is maintained elsewhere, into the QEMU repo, then
you're wrong.  This can be easily judged by how easy it is to convert
all current tests and their features (timeout, download management,
etc).

Another level of judgement that I believe would be helpful to the
decision making process here is how this impacts growing the test
coverage.  Tests that manipulate both QEMU and the guest are still
very very simple compared to what can be found on what I'll call "real
life integration testing" of QEMU (read Avocado-VT like tests). But
they present a glimpse of the problem. Having such tests requires a
good amount of code to either be used from a project/repo that
addresses that specifically, or be duplicated inside QEMU.

I am on the side of the unified execution approach.  But, will it
really be simple to convert all tests?  "Real life integration" tests
too?  I would love to see that, but I can't see how that can be done
without the woes mentioned before (duplicating other code or limiting
the further toolset and capabilities of test writers).

Best regards,
