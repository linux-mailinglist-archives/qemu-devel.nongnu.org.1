This series includes three patches that were posted a fairly
long time ago. They are borderline between a feature request
and a bug fix, but I'm classing them more bug fix, since they
addressing issues with cert acceptance that we really should
not have had.

The patches by Henry had outstanding comments from myself,
and I've chosen to simply fix them in two followup commits
of my own now to get this over the line.

The patch from "matoro" was not accepted because they were
contributed under a github alias. With our change to have
a more relaxed interpretation of the DCO allowing any
"known identity", we can now accept this patch. It had
some conflicts with Henry's patch which I've fixed up.

Then there is one other small bug fix and one improvement
to use a newer gnutls API.

Changed in v2:

 - Dropped already merged patch & re-arrange remaining
   series

Daniel P. Berrang√© (4):
  crypto: remove extraneous pointer usage in gnutls certs
  crypto: stop requiring "key encipherment" usage in x509 certs
  crypto: switch to newer gnutls API for distinguished name
  crypto: fix error reporting in cert chain checks

Henry Kleynhans (1):
  crypto: only verify CA certs in chain of trust

matoro (1):
  crypto: allow client/server cert chains
