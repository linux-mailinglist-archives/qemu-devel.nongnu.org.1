Agree.

In most cases, you are right. But all the FT/HA system design for the
rare cases.

I haven't tested multifd part yet. But let me introduce the background.
COLO system including 2 ways for live migration, network compare triggered
and periodic execution(maybe 10s). It means COLO VM performance
depends on live migration VM stop time, maybe the multifd can help for
this, Lukas?

Yes, after failover, the secondary VM running without migration.

Agree, as Lukas said, some customers not follow upstream code(or 2
versions ago) for COLO.
Because FT/HA users focus on system availibility, upgrade is a high
risk for them.
I think the main reason of COLO broken for QEMU release 10.0/10.1 is
lack of test case(Lukas WIP on this).
