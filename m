It works, but due to how low-level fdset is, it's difficult to match the
low level error to anything meaningful we can report to the user. I'll
have to add an errp to monitor_fdset_dup_fd_add(). Its returns are not
very useful.

-1 with no errno
-1 with EACCES (should actually be EBADF)
-1 with ENOENT

There has been some discusstion around this before actually:

https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2021-08/msg02544.html

Or, you know, let the management layer figure it out. We seem to be
heading in this direction already. I imagine once the code is written to
interact with QEMU, it would not have any reason to change, so it might
be ok to replace some of the code I'm adding in this series with
documentation and call it a day. I don't like this approach very much,
but it would definitely make this series way simpler.
