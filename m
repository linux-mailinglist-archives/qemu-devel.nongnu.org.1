In st_set_trace_file, if no explicit filename is given by the user we
use a default filename "trace-$PID", so *if* the atfork handler in
the child were to reset its file after fork it'll get a distinct
filename. Happy days.

If the user provided an explicit filename though, we just use that as
is and would end up with dualling writers and likely data corruption.
While we could blindly append a pid to the user's filename it is 
somewhat unhelpful in the daemonize case to split it across files.

Whether we actually want tracing in a child also possibly depends on
the reason for fork.

If we're forking to daemonize, then we (mostly) want tracing in the
child and (mostly) no longer care about the parent.

If we're forking to exec another app, then we (mostly) want tracing in
the parent and (mostly) no longer care about the child.

With regards,
Daniel
