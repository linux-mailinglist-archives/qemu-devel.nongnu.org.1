I queried the looseness of this wording, and it is suggested
it wasn't intended to apply to existing packages, just newly
added ones. By that interpretation it wouldn't be valid for
QEMU, and we'd be pushed towards the revert downstream, to
retain a runtime check for the feature. I really hate the
idea of keeping a revert of these patches downstream though,
as it would be an indefinite rebase headache.

With regards,
Daniel
