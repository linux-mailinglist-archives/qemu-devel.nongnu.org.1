This sounds like rather a major impl flaw in the vhost-user code
IMHO. Anything that is running in the main thread needs to have
very fast execution times, without any blocking on I/O, to avoid
starving the main event loop. The event loop starvation is really
a much bigger problem than the delayed shutdown on ctrl-c.

I'm not familiar with the vhost-user code, but can you share an
example of the stack trace you see when it is blocked on an I/O
op and preventing shutdown ?

I'm very dis-inclined to special case the channel-socket.c code
to workaruond a bug in a single part of qemu, given that this
code is used universally across everything doing socket I/O.

Some of these parts of QEMU potentially want to be able to do
a clean shutdown of their I/O layer when QEMU exit, and not
restarting on EINTR might negatively impact them. IOW, this
proposed workaround may well simply move the brokness from
one place to another place and not leave us better overall.
