This is a bit misleading because even today we could split the
multifd_ram_flush_and_sync() into _flush and _sync (haven't I seen a
patch doing this somewhere? Maybe from Maciej...) and call just the
_sync here, which is unrelated to any multifd queue.

I think we shouldn't tie "sync" with "wait for multifd threads to finish
sending their data (a kind of flush)" as this implies. The sync is as
much making sure the threads are ready to receive as it is making sure
the data is received in order with relation to ram scanning rounds.

IOW, the local sync is what ensures multifd send threads are flushed
while this code deals with the sync of src&dst threads, which is "just"
a synchronization point between the two QEMUs.

I'm not sure it's a side-effect. It seems deliberate to me, seeing that
multifd usually does its own synchronization. For instance, on the send
side we also need some sync to make sure ram.c doesn't send data to
multifd send threads that are not ready yet (i.e. the wait on
channels_ready at the start of multifd_send()).

I don't understand this statement, you're saying that QEMU src could
just start dumping data on the channel without a remote end? Certainly
for file migrations, but socket as well?
