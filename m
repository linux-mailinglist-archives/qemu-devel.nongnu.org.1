If you are root you can change things. I have shown the options using 
aa-complain and aa-disable that you can revert once the test has 
finished: sudo aa-enforce /usr/bin/swtpm

You could also copy swtpm into a user-owned directory but you will have 
to adapt the user's PATH. That's an easy option.

The most compatible option is the 3rd option since I would expect that 
we will have this rule in a future version of the usr.bin.swtpm Ubuntu 
profile provided by the swtpm package:

echo "include <abstractions/user-tmp>" >> 
/etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.bin.swtpm
apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.swtpm

I am not aware of how user/non-root-started programs can be generally 
made exempt from AppArmor.

There may still be a security boundary if a user runs QEMU and swtpm was 
able to manipulate (with malicious input) the user's files in some 
undesirable way or copy the user's data elsewhere. In this case it may 
be desirable for the user that the profile be applied and the PATH he is 
using points to the standard swtpm.
