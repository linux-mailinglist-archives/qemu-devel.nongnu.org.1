That makes sense to me. Since buses are mainly implemented in C, the curren=
t=20
focus of Rust is on porting the device layer. Rust-implemented devices are=
=20
consumers and do not create any child objects.

I think our previous confusion stemmed from the assumption that Rust was=20
porting the entire hierarchy, when in fact Rust is currently only implement=
ing=20
the device layer.

For this part, we directly referred to the implementation of SysBus.

Yes, I'll fix it later.

I'll revise all the points you have raised later.
