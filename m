When QEMU automatically toggles machine type featuers based on host
kernel, relying on libvirt to then disable them again is impractical,
as we cannot assume that the libvirt people are using knows about
newly introduced features. Even if libvirt is updated to know about
it, people can easily be using a previous libvirt release.

QEMU itself needs to make the machine types do that they are there
todo, which is to define a stable machine ABI. 

What QEMU is missing here is a "platform ABI" concept, to encode
sets of features which are tied to specific platform generations.
As long as we don't have that we'll keep having these broken
migration problems from machine types dynamically changing instead
of providing a stable guest ABI.

With regards,
Daniel
