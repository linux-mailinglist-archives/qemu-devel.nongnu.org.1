Yes, that is correct. Essentially this ends up calling

   execve(@args[0], @args)

Now you also have to declare whether '@args' includes or excludes
'program' as @args[0]. execve() style would be to have '@args[0]'
duplicate 'program'. Personally I think that's overkill for QEMU's
needs. If we don't include 'program' in @args, then we have to
document this, as it isn't discoverable from the QAPI design.

Not separating 'program' and 'args' in QAPI makes it unambiguous
that 'args' must include everything.

Definitely not. This encodes an assumption that we're spawning via a
shell. The intent with the new design is that it lets mgmt apps fully
eliminate use of shell, and directly invoke the program, thus eliminating
potential (security) pitfalls with shell metacharacters.
