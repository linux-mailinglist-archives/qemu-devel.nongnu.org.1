Yeh, the send/recv sides are indeed not fully symmetrical in the case of
multifd - the recv side is more IO-driven, e.g., QEMU reacts based on what
it receives (which was encoded in the headers of the received packets).

The src is more of a generic consumer / producer model where threads can
enqueue tasks / data to different iochannels.

As commented in a previous email, I had a feeling that Maciej wanted to
avoid blocking multifd threads when applying VFIO data chunks to the kernel
driver, but Maciej please correct me.. I could be wrong.

To me I think I'm fine even if it blocks multifd threads, as it'll only
happen when with VFIO (we may want to consider n_multifd_threads to be
based on num of vfio devices then, so we still always have some idle
threads taking IOs out of the NIC buffers).

So I agree with Cedric that if we can provide a functional working version
first then we can at least go with the simpler approach first.
