Hi Palmer,
Performance optimization can be challenging for newcomers. I wouldn't
recommend it for a GSoC project unless you have time to seed the
project idea with specific optimizations to implement based on your
experience and profiling. That way the intern has a solid starting
point where they can have a few successes before venturing out to do
their own performance analysis.

Do you have the time to profile and add specifics to the project idea
by Feb 21st? If that sounds good to you, I'll add it to the project
ideas list and you can add more detailed tasks in the coming weeks.

Thanks,
Stefan
