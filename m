Depends on the command's intended use.

In general, failing a command is better than silently not doing what it
commands.  If the command is "tell the guest the window size changed",
and we can't, then failing the command is better than silently doing
nothing.

Howver, other considerations can trump this.  If we want to use this
command on any window size change without having to know the device
type, having it silently do nothing for device types that don't support
it can be more convenient.  Fine as long as the behavior is clearly
documented.

Thanks!

Would it make sense to mention this gap in a commit message?

Do you think working this into the documentation would be useful?

If we could already query chardev configuration / state comprehensively,
then I'd ask you to make it cover your new state bits, too.

Since we don't, and there is no clear use case at this time, I'm not
asking you to do that.
