I mean, as far as I am concerned, you can keep what you already have as
the fallback approach. Reflink copy if possible, and otherwise a slow
full copy.

Or if the coredump can be written to, you could do the in-place editing,
though I would save the original content in a file that could survive a
crash. And after finishing the operation, the original content
definitely should be written back.

All of these solutions are interesting, but honestly feel a bit too
complex for a simple debugging script.
