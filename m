Acking it was a mistake on my part - I mis-interpreted the patch and so
didn't notice we were loosing the verbose printing of missing features
by default.

I'm actually curious why we made the 'check' feature tied to machine
types at all. If it doesn't affect guest ABI, just causes verbose
info on stderr, it feels like something we could have just had on
all machine types new & old. Git history brings us back to

  commit 3e68482224129c3ddc061af7c9d438b882ecfdd1
  Author: Eduardo Habkost <ehabkost@redhat.com>

    target-i386: Set "check=off" by default on pc-*-2.4 and older
    
    The default CPU model (qemu64) have some issues today: it enables some
    features (ABM and SSE4a) that are not present in many host CPUs. That
    means many hosts (but not all of them) had those features silently
    disabled in the default configuration in QEMU 2.4 and older.
    
    With the new "check=on" default, this causes warnings to be printed in
    the default configuration, because of the lack of SSE4A on all Intel
    hosts, and the lack of ABM on Sandy Bridge and older hosts:
    
      $ qemu-system-x86_64 -machine pc,accel=kvm
      warning: host doesn't support requested feature: CPUID.80000001H:ECX.abm [bit 5]
      warning: host doesn't support requested feature: CPUID.80000001H:ECX.sse4a [bit 6]
    
    Those issues will be fixed in pc-*-2.5 and newer. But as we can't change
    the guest ABI in pc-*-2.4, disable "check" mode by default in pc-*-2.4
    and older so we don't print spurious warnings.

IOW, we wanted to have 'check' unconditionally on by default, but
had to do a temp hack to avoid spamming all configurations with
the broken 'qemu64' CPU model design.

IMHO even with mgmt apps, it is worth having 'check=on' by default
as the log message has value in debugging scenarios. It could have
the potential to highlight situations where an mgmt app has
unwittingly done something wrong with CPU config. At the very least
though its a warning to humans debugging that they should not trust
the QEMU command line as a expressing the full CPU featureset.

With regards,
Daniel
