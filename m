We _do_ observe the exception occuring, we just don't observe it being
handled. Instead we observe the result after the trap handler returned.
And that's probably what we want for user-mode emulation where we don't
have any introspection into the trap handler's execution.

What trips the testing plugin is that it expects observing the trap
handler, and there's currently nothing we can do here instead of just
giving up when running user-mode emulation. We can introduce actual tests
for user-mode emulation again in the future, should we introduce a
discontinuity type for trap handler return (e.g. for RISC-V's `mret`).

I could, but that would be somewhat separate from the trap related
stuff. Syscalls would likely qualify as a separate, new discontinuity
type similar to host calls.

I still need to distinguish between discontinuity types, and that does
(currently) require target specific knowledge. Or maybe I misunderstood
what you were trying to say?
