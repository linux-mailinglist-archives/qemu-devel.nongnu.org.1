I'm sure it can work, but that sounds more like a SHOULD (MAY?),
rather than a MUST.

You mean that a virtio device can use absolute memory addresses for
other devices' shared memory regions, but it can't use absolute memory
addresses for its own shared memory regions? That's a rather strange
requirement. Or is the statement simply giving an addressing strategy
that device type specifications are free to ignore?
