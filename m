So I'm wondering what the general sentiment is towards having an "Intel"
device show up in your non-Intel guest. This device is generic enough to
be included in PCI_DEVICES, and should be usable on any of those
platforms.

Linux treats this as a generic PCI driver as well. Do we know what
Windows on non-x86 expects? The *BSDs? Others?

I don't think the suggestion was to disable the existing driver on
non-Intel setups, but to add a more generic one. Still, more work to get
this actually propagated into guests than doing the change in
QEMU. Before I start down that route, I'd like to know whether the issue
is actually big enough to make investing time there worth it.
