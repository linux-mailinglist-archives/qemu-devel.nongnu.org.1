I guess this will only get worse with the single binary that will also add 
if target == checks and removes some of the optimisations that assumed 
endianness and word size. It would be good if somebody could do some tests 
to check performance issues which could be made part of the test suite so 
we at least notice these changes. I'm not sure what would be a good set of 
benchmarks, I've used STREAM to check memory access and exceptions/MMU and 
lame some.waw some.mp3 to check FPU and vector instructions speed before 
but maybe there are better tools.

I've also tried adding function pointers to CPU class for different 
exception models to remove the switch from the beginning of excp handling 
functions that call out to PPC64 specific versions but I found that to be 
slower than the current switch at least on x86_64 host.
