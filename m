MachineInitPhase is set to PHASE=5FMACHINE=5FREADY during ram=5Fload() =
for
both -loadvm and HMP loadvm, so unfortunately that isn=E2=80=99t an opt=
ion.

RunState during ram=5Fload() is
- RUN=5FSTATE=5FINMIGRATE for -incoming,
- RUN=5FSTATE=5FPRELAUNCH for -loadvm
- RUN=5FSTATE=5FRESTORE=5FVM for HMP loadvm.
But I=E2=80=99m not sure how reliable (or unreliable) it would be to de=
pend on this
to infer that RAM is zero.

As for using a flag, I don=E2=80=99t see an obvious way to pass one dow=
n through
load=5Fsnapshot -> qemu=5Floadvm=5Fstate -> ... -> read=5Framblock=5Fma=
pped=5Fram.
Do you already have something in mind?

Thank you
Marco
