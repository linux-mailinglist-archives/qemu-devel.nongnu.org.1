So, ideally, we could try two URLs.  The "download" path has the full
CDN that we operate behind it. It's the least load on our
infrastructure. However, if that fails, the "archive" path will have
the same images. The "archive" path could be used all the time if the
two URL strategy can't be used. The downloads will be slower, but the
images are already transferred to the archive machine (not cdn) about
a week or so after the release. If the load is going to be super low,
this would be acceptable (and I suspect that it would be since we
cache these images). This would allow older releases to keep working
(once we transition to either the two or one url strategies), and all
the other nice features having the same tests today and 4 years from
now, should we ever need to test that, say for regressions. What's the
anticipated load, measured in downloads per day say, this testing
generates?

As for the second one, I've added reminders as well as a request to
our release team to ask me if I've done it a month after the release.
We'll see how well that works out since the update takes minutes.

Speaking of which, has someone done the update? I'm a bit behind on my
qemu stuff and haven't been paying attention.
