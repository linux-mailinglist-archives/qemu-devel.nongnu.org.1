Yes, that's the whole point of the exercise IMHO.

The benefit is that it brings 'migrate' into line with all other
QMP commands, such that the data provided with the command is
precisely what controls behaviour, giving predictable behaviour.

atomicity is only one of the goals - being free from side effects
of externally set global state is the more important aspect.

Even if only a single mgmt app is involved this is still beneficial
because the migration infrastructure is used for distinct use cases
inside QEMU - live migration, CPR, save/restore, and savevm/loadvm.
Any time code any one of those uses cases starts using a new parameter,
apps have to make sure they don't inadvertantly have its effects apply
to the other use cases.

Again, it makes the behaviour predictable as the QMP command fully expresses
what action is going to be peformed, free with side effets of any previously
set state.

Daniel
