I thought it was mostly me who reviewed it, am I right?  Or do you have
other thread that has such discussion happening, and the design review has
properly done and reached an agreement?

IMHO that is also not how RFC works.

It doesn't work like "if RFC didn't got NACKed, a maintainer should merge
v1 when someone posts it".  Instead RFC should only mean these at least to
me: "(1) please review this from high level, things can drastically change;
(2) please don't merge this, because it is not for merging but for getting
comments."

Beyond, it doesn't imply anything for what happens after the RFC series.

The latest email in that thread (assuming this one is what you're referring
to) is:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/f67fcc88-aaf6-43f7-9287-90cbd7495ba1@nvidia.com/#t

I didn't hear anything from Avihai yet, neither did I think we reached an
complete agreement on the whole design.

IMO it really depends on what was proposed.  Anyone who send patches should
definitely test whatever the patchset provides.  If that patchset includes
the iteration changes then that needs to be tested by the submitter.

AFAICT it will affect the wire protocol?  If the dest QEMU contains your
patcheset to be the old version of QEMU, then the threads will only be
created at the switchover phase, and it won't be ready to take whatever
data sent from a new QEMU which may allow migrating VFIO iteration data,
who may expect these VFIO data to be passed over via multifd channels
even before the switchover.

It can only be compatible at least when the threads are created before
iteration starts on dest side, and I didn't yet check the packet headers
and other stuffs.

I think that can be a sweet spot where maybe you can land this series
sooner, but it also gets ready for anyone who wants to further extend that
to iteration phase easily.  Not sure whether it'll be easily feasible by
just moving the thread creations earlier.

Yes it won't, but IMHO that's not an issue.

Since Fabiano is going on a short break soon, I think I'll be the only one
review it.  I'll try my best, but still I can't guarantee it will be able
to land in 9.1, and this is not the only thing I'll need to do next week..

I appreciated a lot you worked out VFIO on top of multifd, because IMHO
that's really the right direction.  However even with that, I don't think
the whole design is yet fully settled, not to mention the details. And that
implies it may miss 9.1.

Thanks,
