To be honest, I'm concerned that you may be using QEMU as a staging tree 
for Mesa/virglrenderer. Submitting a documentation to QEMU as a 
preparation to submit one to Mesa is not OK.

You shouldn't submit a documentation to QEMU if upstream
Mesa developers rejects it because it contains too little information. 
It may not hurt QEMU, but still lacks a valid reasoning.

Mesa should have more people who care virtio-gpu as there are people 
using other VMMs and perhaps it may be difficult to convince them to add 
a documentation like this. It is still not a good idea to workaround 
that by adding one to QEMU. The documentation submitted to QEMU is 
mostly reviewed only by me, who barely used Venus and DRM native 
contexts, which is not a good sign. Getting reviewed by more people is 
one of the advantage of open-source contribution after all so let's keep it.

I can help you add a documentation to Mesa by reviewing and supporting 
one if you want, but I cannot support adding one to QEMU if it's done to 
avoid a potential challenge to add it to Mesa.

Akihiko Odaki
