Thanks Phil, much appreciated! Enjoy your time off.

I've just posted an updated -v3 of my xhci patch series as v2 suffered from
the same breakage as this patch set. I recommend applying that one on top
for testing vmapple. It helps when you can use keyboard and mouse properly
and don't need to mess around with VNC.

All the best,
Phil
