I agree.

Moreover, I can't see why we should invest into making such packaging
easy without a shred of evidence for anyone actually doing it.

It's gross, it's functional, it's impressive in a "don't do this at
home, kids" way, and it comes with a big, red "John, help!"  button for
you to smash in case of trouble.  Because the few smart enough to be
able to maintain that code are almost certainly much too smart to be
willing to maintain that code.
