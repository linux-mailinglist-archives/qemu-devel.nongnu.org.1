We should probably mention that sometimes the committer may update the
patch after they have pulled it into the tree. In those cases we preface
the S-o-B tag with a comment:

  Signed-off-by: Original Hacker <hacker@domain>
  [MH: tweaked the commit message for clarity]
  Signed-off-by: Maintainer Hacker <hacker@another.com>

If a

Much as I love Emacs I wonder if this next section is worth it given the
multiple ways you can solve this (I use yas-snippet expansions for
example).

If we do want to mention the editors we should probably also mention b4.
