Looks like a copy-paste error..  I found it, should be 9ba3b2baa1
("migration: add vsock as data channel support").

https://e.huawei.com/sa/material/event/HC/e37b9c4c33e14e869bb1183fab468fed

So if I read it right.. the VM in this case is inside a container or
something, then it talks to an "agent" on a PCIe device which understands
virtio-vsock protocol.  So maybe vsock just performs better than other ways
to dig that tunnel for the container.

In that case, mentioning vsock is at least ok.

It's not strictly a compatibility mess.  IIUC, it was used to be designed
to always work with EOS.  I think at that time Juan was still focused on
making it work and not whole perf tunings, but then we found it can be a
major perf issue if we flush too soon.  Then if we flush it once per round,
it may not always pair with a EOS.  That's why we needed a new message.

But hey, you're writting a doc that helps everyone.  You deserve to decide
whether you like to mention it or not on this one. :)

IIRC we updated our compat rule so we maintain each machine type for only 6
years.  It means the whole per-iteration + EOS stuff can be removed in 3.5
years or so - we did that work in July 2022.  So it isn't that important
either to mention indeed.

I still think it should be done in RAM code only.  One major goal (if not
the only goal..) is it wants to order different versions of pages and
that's only what the RAM module is about, not migration in general.

From that POV, having a QEMU_VM_* is kind of the wrong layer - they should
work for migration in general.

Said so, I agree we do violate it from time to time, for example, we have a
bunch of subcmds (MIG_CMD_POSTCOPY*) just for postcopy, which is under
QEMU_VM_COMMAND.  But IIUC that was either kind of ancient (so we need to
stick with them now.. postcopy was there for 10 years) or it needs some
ping-pong messages in which case QEMU_VM_COMMAND is the easiest.. IMHO we
should still try to stick with the layering if possible.
