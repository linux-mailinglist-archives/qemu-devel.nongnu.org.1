Special feature deprecated means the use of the thing that has it is
deprecated with this particular qemu-system-FOO.

Why "this particular"?  Because it wasn't deprecated in some prior
version of QEMU.  Features (special or not) are always, always about the
specific qemu-system-FOO binary you're talking to via QMP.

Conditionals are compile-time schema configuration.  Either the
condition is true or not at compile time.  If it's true, the thing that
has it is there, else it isn't.

Now combine the two.  If the condition of special feature 'deprecate' is
true, the thing that has it is deprecated with this particular
qemu-system-FOO.  Else it isn't.

Semantics of "apply conditional to feature" don't need defining, because
they are simply the same as "apply conditional to any other thing."
When you have a definition for the general case that works for all the
special cases, then outlawing one special case *increases* complexity.
That's why I'm reluctant.

I figure your actual problem more concrete than "what does it even
mean?", namely how to present conditionals in generated documentation.
In that context, features *may* differ from any other thing!

Aside: the (mostly generated) QMP introspection is about this particular
qemu-system-FOO, like all of QMP, whereas the (mostly generated) QMP
documentation is about any qemu-system-FOO that could be built from this
particular working tree.  May lead to doc generation problems that have
no match elsewhere.

How do you combine definition and conditional?  You answered that right
above: largely TBD.

How do you combine enum value / object type member / command argument /
event argument and conditional?  Also answered right above: not yet.

What does that mean for the doc generator code?  Does it simply ignore
conditionals there?

You choose to make them special in the documentation.  They haven't been
special there so far.  I'm not telling you not to, I'm just pointing out
this is a problem we elect to have :)

I believe what you need isn't so much an explanation of semantics, it's
use cases.  And that's fair!

Let me offer two.

1. Imagine we're trying to develop something big & complex enough to
   make keeping it out of tree until done impractical.  We feel even an
   in-tree branch would be impractical.  Instead, we commit it to
   master, default off, configure --enable-complex-thing to get it.  Not
   exactly something we do all the time, but not outlandish, either.

   Further imagine that the big & complex thing will involve some new
   QMP commands replacing existing ones.  As usual, we want to mark the
   ones being replaced deprecated, so we can remove them after a grace
   period.

   But simply deprecating them in the schema would be premature!  The
   big & complex thing may fail, and if it does, we rip it out.  If it
   succeeds, we enable it unconditionally.

   We can express what we're doing by making feature deprecated
   conditional on CONFIG_COMPLEX_THING, which is defined by
   --enable-complex-thing.

   That way, the complex thing doesn't affect the QMP interface unless
   we enable it.  Good.  And if we enable it, we do get the deprecation,
   and can test management applications cope with it.

2. Imagine we turned allow-preconfig into a special feature.  Further
   imagine some whole-stack feature requires a certain command to have
   allow-preconfig, and you got tasked with implementing it.  Which you
   duly did, to everybody's satisfaction.  It is now days to the
   release, rc4 has sailed, and some dude comes out of the woodwork to
   report the command crashes in preconfig state.  Weird!  It worked
   *fine* in your meticulous testing.  After some back and forth, you
   discover that the reporter builds with --enable-exotic-crap, which
   you didn't test, because you weren't even aware it exists.  You
   enable it, and now the command crashes for you, too.  Fixing this
   after rc4 is out of the question, too much churn.  You could,
   however, make feature allow-preconfig conditional on not
   CONFIG_EXOTIC_CRAP.
