Right.  The cross-reference of MR <-> device makes sense from the concept
level, but I'm not sure how much we rely on that from QEMU perspective
currently.  It complicates refcount and looks like it needs some thoughts.

One proof is, when I replied I actually tested all qemu qtests with below
patch and nothing yet explode:

I'm not sure how much it covers dynamic destruction of devices, though,
where the device creates internal MRs to the guest address space.  I'm
actually wondering whether we have other barriers already to avoid having
any MR ops being invoked if a device was removed.

So I think above indeed would remove the cross-ref we used to have. It
might be a matter of whether that's fine for now to fix the cyclic ref
issue alone, and even if we still want some cross-ref.. whether we should
do it the old way.  I mean, the cross-ref can also be done in other forms,
and it may not block MR has its own refcounts.

Even if we want to have dev<->MR refcount, I wonder whether we should avoid
having MR refcount the device, because it looks like "sub-object refs the
parent" which sounds like a good source of cyclic refcount issue.  I wonder
whether device should ref the MR instead (when MR is dynamically created; I
am not sure whether we even need that if in Phil's comment where the MR
object is a sub-struct-field of the Device object).  Then the device can
provide a proper destroy() function to release the MRs under it, perhaps by
disabling them first (then any ops should already fail after that), then
unref the MRs with the hope that they're the last ref holder then MRs
destroys there too.

Thanks,
