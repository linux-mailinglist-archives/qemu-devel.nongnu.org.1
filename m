  * Live migration with and with out hot-plugging vcpus tests

Please feel free to add,

> (II) Summary
> ============
>
> This patch set introduces virtual CPU hotplug support for the ARMv8 architecture
> in QEMU. The idea is to be able to hotplug and hot-unplug vCPUs while the guest VM
> is running, without requiring a reboot. This does *not* make any assumptions about
> the physical CPU hotplug availability within the host system but rather tries to
> solve the problem at the virtualizer/QEMU layer. It introduces ACPI CPU hotplug hooks
> and event handling to interface with the guest kernel, and code to initialize, plug,
> and unplug CPUs. No changes are required within the host kernel/KVM except the
> support of hypercall exit handling in the user-space/Qemu, which has recently
> been added to the kernel. Corresponding guest kernel changes have been
> posted on the mailing list [3] [4] by James Morse.
>
> (III) Motivation
> ================
>
> This allows scaling the guest VM compute capacity on-demand, which would be
> useful for the following example scenarios:
>
> 1. Vertical Pod Autoscaling [9][10] in the cloud: Part of the orchestration
>     framework that could adjust resource requests (CPU and Mem requests) for
>     the containers in a pod, based on usage.
> 2. Pay-as-you-grow Business Model: Infrastructure providers could allocate and
>     restrict the total number of compute resources available to the guest VM
>     according to the SLA (Service Level Agreement). VM owners could request more
>     compute to be hot-plugged for some cost.
>
> For example, Kata Container VM starts with a minimum amount of resources (i.e.,
> hotplug everything approach). Why?
>
> 1. Allowing faster *boot time* and
> 2. Reduction in *memory footprint*
>
> Kata Container VM can boot with just 1 vCPU, and then later more vCPUs can be
> hot-plugged as needed.
>
> (IV) Terminology
> ================
>
> (*) Possible CPUs: Total vCPUs that could ever exist in the VM. This includes
>                     any cold-booted CPUs plus any CPUs that could be later
>                     hot-plugged.
>                     - Qemu parameter (-smp maxcpus=N)
> (*) Present CPUs:  Possible CPUs that are ACPI 'present'. These might or might
>                     not be ACPI 'enabled'.
>                     - Present vCPUs = Possible vCPUs (Always on ARM Arch)
> (*) Enabled CPUs:  Possible CPUs that are ACPI 'present' and 'enabled' and can
>                     now be ‘onlined’ (PSCI) for use by the Guest Kernel. All cold-
>                     booted vCPUs are ACPI 'enabled' at boot. Later, using
>                     device_add, more vCPUs can be hotplugged and made ACPI
>                     'enabled'.
>                     - Qemu parameter (-smp cpus=N). Can be used to specify some
> 	           cold-booted vCPUs during VM init. Some can be added using the
> 	           '-device' option.

> (V) Constraints Due to ARMv8 CPU Architecture [+] Other Impediments
> ===================================================================
>
> A. Physical Limitation to Support CPU Hotplug: (Architectural Constraint)
>     1. ARMv8 CPU architecture does not support the concept of the physical CPU
>        hotplug.
>        a. There are many per-CPU components like PMU, SVE, MTE, Arch timers, etc.,
>           whose behavior needs to be clearly defined when the CPU is hot(un)plugged.
>           There is no specification for this.
>
>     2. Other ARM components like GIC, etc., have not been designed to realize
>        physical CPU hotplug capability as of now. For example,
>        a. Every physical CPU has a unique GICC (GIC CPU Interface) by construct.
>           Architecture does not specify what CPU hot(un)plug would mean in
>           context to any of these.
>        b. CPUs/GICC are physically connected to unique GICR (GIC Redistributor).
>           GIC Redistributors are always part of the always-on power domain. Hence,
>           they cannot be powered off as per specification.
>
> B. Impediments in Firmware/ACPI (Architectural Constraint)
>
>     1. Firmware has to expose GICC, GICR, and other per-CPU features like PMU,
>        SVE, MTE, Arch Timers, etc., to the OS. Due to the architectural constraint
>        stated in section A1(a), all interrupt controller structures of
>        MADT describing GIC CPU Interfaces and the GIC Redistributors MUST be
>        presented by firmware to the OSPM during boot time.
>     2. Architectures that support CPU hotplug can evaluate the ACPI _MAT method to
>        get this kind of information from the firmware even after boot, and the
>        OSPM has the capability to process these. ARM kernel uses information in MADT
>        interrupt controller structures to identify the number of present CPUs during
>        boot and hence does not allow to change these after boot. The number of
>        present CPUs cannot be changed. It is an architectural constraint!
>
> C. Impediments in KVM to Support Virtual CPU Hotplug (Architectural Constraint)
>
>     1. KVM VGIC:
>        a. Sizing of various VGIC resources like memory regions, etc., related to
>           the redistributor happens only once and is fixed at the VM init time
>           and cannot be changed later after initialization has happened.
>           KVM statically configures these resources based on the number of vCPUs
>           and the number/size of redistributor ranges.
>        b. Association between vCPU and its VGIC redistributor is fixed at the
>           VM init time within the KVM, i.e., when redistributor iodevs gets
>           registered. VGIC does not allow to setup/change this association
>           after VM initialization has happened. Physically, every CPU/GICC is
>           uniquely connected with its redistributor, and there is no
>           architectural way to set this up.
>     2. KVM vCPUs:
>        a. Lack of specification means destruction of KVM vCPUs does not exist as
>           there is no reference to tell what to do with other per-vCPU
>           components like redistributors, arch timer, etc.
>        b. In fact, KVM does not implement the destruction of vCPUs for any
>           architecture. This is independent of whether the architecture
>           actually supports CPU Hotplug feature. For example, even for x86 KVM
>           does not implement the destruction of vCPUs.
>
> D. Impediments in Qemu to Support Virtual CPU Hotplug (KVM Constraints->Arch)
>
>     1. Qemu CPU Objects MUST be created to initialize all the Host KVM vCPUs to
>        overcome the KVM constraint. KVM vCPUs are created and initialized when Qemu
>        CPU Objects are realized. But keeping the QOM CPU objects realized for
>        'yet-to-be-plugged' vCPUs can create problems when these new vCPUs shall
>        be plugged using device_add and a new QOM CPU object shall be created.
>     2. GICV3State and GICV3CPUState objects MUST be sized over *possible vCPUs*
>        during VM init time while QOM GICV3 Object is realized. This is because
>        KVM VGIC can only be initialized once during init time. But every
>        GICV3CPUState has an associated QOM CPU Object. Later might correspond to
>        vCPU which are 'yet-to-be-plugged' (unplugged at init).
>     3. How should new QOM CPU objects be connected back to the GICV3CPUState
>        objects and disconnected from it in case the CPU is being hot(un)plugged?
>     4. How should 'unplugged' or 'yet-to-be-plugged' vCPUs be represented in the
>        QOM for which KVM vCPU already exists? For example, whether to keep,
>         a. No QOM CPU objects Or
>         b. Unrealized CPU Objects
>     5. How should vCPU state be exposed via ACPI to the Guest? Especially for
>        the unplugged/yet-to-be-plugged vCPUs whose CPU objects might not exist
>        within the QOM but the Guest always expects all possible vCPUs to be
>        identified as ACPI *present* during boot.
>     6. How should Qemu expose GIC CPU interfaces for the unplugged or
>        yet-to-be-plugged vCPUs using ACPI MADT Table to the Guest?
>
> E. Summary of Approach ([+] Workarounds to problems in sections A, B, C & D)
>
>     1. At VM Init, pre-create all the possible vCPUs in the Host KVM i.e., even
>        for the vCPUs which are yet-to-be-plugged in Qemu but keep them in the
>        powered-off state.
>     2. After the KVM vCPUs have been initialized in the Host, the KVM vCPU
>        objects corresponding to the unplugged/yet-to-be-plugged vCPUs are parked
>        at the existing per-VM "kvm_parked_vcpus" list in Qemu. (similar to x86)
>     3. GICV3State and GICV3CPUState objects are sized over possible vCPUs during
>        VM init time i.e., when Qemu GIC is realized. This, in turn, sizes KVM VGIC
>        resources like memory regions, etc., related to the redistributors with the
>        number of possible KVM vCPUs. This never changes after VM has initialized.
>     4. Qemu CPU objects corresponding to unplugged/yet-to-be-plugged vCPUs are
>        released post Host KVM CPU and GIC/VGIC initialization.
>     5. Build ACPI MADT Table with the following updates:
>        a. Number of GIC CPU interface entries (=possible vCPUs)
>        b. Present Boot vCPU as MADT.GICC.Enabled=1 (Not hot[un]pluggable)
>        c. Present hot(un)pluggable vCPUs as MADT.GICC.online-capable=1
>           - MADT.GICC.Enabled=0 (Mutually exclusive) [6][7]
> 	 - vCPU can be ACPI enabled+onlined after Guest boots (Firmware Policy)
> 	 - Some issues with above (details in later sections)
>     6. Expose below ACPI Status to Guest kernel:
>        a. Always _STA.Present=1 (all possible vCPUs)
>        b. _STA.Enabled=1 (plugged vCPUs)
>        c. _STA.Enabled=0 (unplugged vCPUs)
>     7. vCPU hotplug *realizes* new QOM CPU object. The following happens:
>        a. Realizes, initializes QOM CPU Object & spawns Qemu vCPU thread.
>        b. Unparks the existing KVM vCPU ("kvm_parked_vcpus" list).
>           - Attaches to QOM CPU object.
>        c. Reinitializes KVM vCPU in the Host.
>           - Resets the core and sys regs, sets defaults, etc.
>        d. Runs KVM vCPU (created with "start-powered-off").
> 	 - vCPU thread sleeps (waits for vCPU reset via PSCI).
>        e. Updates Qemu GIC.
>           - Wires back IRQs related to this vCPU.
>           - GICV3CPUState association with QOM CPU Object.
>        f. Updates [6] ACPI _STA.Enabled=1.
>        g. Notifies Guest about the new vCPU (via ACPI GED interface).
> 	 - Guest checks _STA.Enabled=1.
> 	 - Guest adds processor (registers CPU with LDM) [3].
>        h. Plugs the QOM CPU object in the slot.
>           - slot-number = cpu-index {socket, cluster, core, thread}.
>        i. Guest online's vCPU (CPU_ON PSCI call over HVC/SMC).
>           - KVM exits HVC/SMC Hypercall [5] to Qemu (Policy Check).
>           - Qemu powers-on KVM vCPU in the Host.
>     8. vCPU hot-unplug *unrealizes* QOM CPU Object. The following happens:
>        a. Notifies Guest (via ACPI GED interface) vCPU hot-unplug event.
>           - Guest offline's vCPU (CPU_OFF PSCI call over HVC/SMC).
>        b. KVM exits HVC/SMC Hypercall [5] to Qemu (Policy Check).
>           - Qemu powers-off the KVM vCPU in the Host.
>        c. Guest signals *Eject* vCPU to Qemu.
>        d. Qemu updates [6] ACPI _STA.Enabled=0.
>        e. Updates GIC.
>           - Un-wires IRQs related to this vCPU.
>           - GICV3CPUState association with new QOM CPU Object is updated.
>        f. Unplugs the vCPU.
> 	 - Removes from slot.
>           - Parks KVM vCPU ("kvm_parked_vcpus" list).
>           - Unrealizes QOM CPU Object & joins back Qemu vCPU thread.
> 	 - Destroys QOM CPU object.
>        g. Guest checks ACPI _STA.Enabled=0.
>           - Removes processor (unregisters CPU with LDM) [3].

> (VIII) KNOWN ISSUES
> ===================
>
> 1. Migration has been lightly tested but has been found working.
> 2. TCG is broken.
> 3. HVF and qtest are not supported yet.
> 4. ACPI MADT Table flags [7] MADT.GICC.Enabled and MADT.GICC.online-capable are
>     mutually exclusive, i.e., as per the change [6], a vCPU cannot be both
>     GICC.Enabled and GICC.online-capable. This means:
>        [ Link:https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3706  ]
>     a. If we have to support hot-unplug of the cold-booted vCPUs, then these MUST
>        be specified as GICC.online-capable in the MADT Table during boot by the
>        firmware/Qemu. But this requirement conflicts with the requirement to
>        support new Qemu changes with legacy OS that don't understand
>        MADT.GICC.online-capable Bit. Legacy OS during boot time will ignore this
>        bit, and hence these vCPUs will not appear on such OS. This is unexpected
>        behavior.
>     b. In case we decide to specify vCPUs as MADT.GICC.Enabled and try to unplug
>        these cold-booted vCPUs from OS (which in actuality should be blocked by
>        returning error at Qemu), then features like 'kexec' will break.
>     c. As I understand, removal of the cold-booted vCPUs is a required feature
>        and x86 world allows it.
>     d. Hence, either we need a specification change to make the MADT.GICC.Enabled
>        and MADT.GICC.online-capable Bits NOT mutually exclusive or NOT support
>        the removal of cold-booted vCPUs. In the latter case, a check can be introduced
>        to bar the users from unplugging vCPUs, which were cold-booted, using QMP
>        commands. (Needs discussion!)
>        Please check the patch part of this patch set:
>        [hw/arm/virt: Expose cold-booted CPUs as MADT GICC Enabled].
>     
>        NOTE: This is definitely not a blocker!
> 5. Code related to the notification to GICV3 about the hot(un)plug of a vCPU event
>     might need further discussion.
>
>
> (IX) THINGS TO DO
> =================
>
> 1. Fix issues related to TCG/Emulation support. (Not a blocker)
> 2. Comprehensive Testing is in progress. (Positive feedback from Oracle & Ampere)
> 3. Qemu Documentation (.rst) needs to be updated.
> 4. Fix qtest, HVF Support (Future).
> 5. Update the design issue related to ACPI MADT.GICC flags discussed in known
>     issues. This might require UEFI ACPI specification change (Not a blocker).
> 6. Add ACPI _OSC 'Query' support. Only part of _OSC support exists now. (Not a blocker).

To assist in review and set the right expectations from this RFC, please first
read the sections *APPENDED AT THE END* of this cover letter:

1. Important *DISCLAIMER* [Section (X)]
2. Work presented at KVMForum Conference (slides available) [Section (V)F]
3. Organization of patches [Section (XI)]
4. References [Section (XII)]
5. Detailed TODO list of leftover work or work-in-progress [Section (IX)]

There has been interest shown by other organizations in adapting this series
for their architecture. Hence, RFC V2 [21] has been split into architecture
*agnostic* [22] and *specific* patch sets.

This is an ARM architecture-specific patch set carved out of RFC V2. Please
check section (XI)B for details of architecture agnostic patches.

1. ACPI MADT Table GIC CPU Interface can now be presented [6] as ACPI
   *online-capable* or *enabled* to the Guest OS at boot time. This means
   associated CPUs can have ACPI _STA as *enabled* or *disabled* even after boot.
   See UEFI ACPI 6.5 Spec, Section 05, Table 5.37 GICC CPU Interface Flags[20].
2. SMCC/HVC Hypercall exit handling in userspace/Qemu for PSCI CPU_{ON,OFF}
   request. This is required to {dis}allow online'ing a vCPU.
3. Always presenting unplugged vCPUs in CPUs ACPI AML code as ACPI _STA.PRESENT 
   to the Guest OS. Toggling ACPI _STA.Enabled to give an effect of the
   hot{un}plug.
4. Live Migration works (some issues are still there).
5. TCG/HVF/qtest does not support Hotplug and falls back to default.
6. Code for TCG support exists in this release (it is a work-in-progress).
7. ACPI _OSC method can now be used by OSPM to negotiate Qemu VM platform
   hotplug capability (_OSC Query support still pending).
8. Misc. Bug fixes.

(II) Summary
============

This patch set introduces virtual CPU hotplug support for the ARMv8 architecture
in QEMU. The idea is to be able to hotplug and hot-unplug vCPUs while the guest VM
is running, without requiring a reboot. This does *not* make any assumptions about
the physical CPU hotplug availability within the host system but rather tries to
solve the problem at the virtualizer/QEMU layer. It introduces ACPI CPU hotplug hooks
and event handling to interface with the guest kernel, and code to initialize, plug,
and unplug CPUs. No changes are required within the host kernel/KVM except the
support of hypercall exit handling in the user-space/Qemu, which has recently
been added to the kernel. Corresponding guest kernel changes have been
posted on the mailing list [3] [4] by James Morse.

(III) Motivation
================

This allows scaling the guest VM compute capacity on-demand, which would be
useful for the following example scenarios:

1. Vertical Pod Autoscaling [9][10] in the cloud: Part of the orchestration
   framework that could adjust resource requests (CPU and Mem requests) for
   the containers in a pod, based on usage.
2. Pay-as-you-grow Business Model: Infrastructure providers could allocate and
   restrict the total number of compute resources available to the guest VM
   according to the SLA (Service Level Agreement). VM owners could request more
   compute to be hot-plugged for some cost.

For example, Kata Container VM starts with a minimum amount of resources (i.e.,
hotplug everything approach). Why?

1. Allowing faster *boot time* and
2. Reduction in *memory footprint*

Kata Container VM can boot with just 1 vCPU, and then later more vCPUs can be
hot-plugged as needed.

(IV) Terminology
================

(*) Possible CPUs: Total vCPUs that could ever exist in the VM. This includes
                   any cold-booted CPUs plus any CPUs that could be later
                   hot-plugged.
                   - Qemu parameter (-smp maxcpus=N)
(*) Present CPUs:  Possible CPUs that are ACPI 'present'. These might or might
                   not be ACPI 'enabled'. 
                   - Present vCPUs = Possible vCPUs (Always on ARM Arch)
(*) Enabled CPUs:  Possible CPUs that are ACPI 'present' and 'enabled' and can
                   now be ‘onlined’ (PSCI) for use by the Guest Kernel. All cold-
                   booted vCPUs are ACPI 'enabled' at boot. Later, using
                   device_add, more vCPUs can be hotplugged and made ACPI
                   'enabled'.
                   - Qemu parameter (-smp cpus=N). Can be used to specify some
	           cold-booted vCPUs during VM init. Some can be added using the
	           '-device' option.

(V) Constraints Due to ARMv8 CPU Architecture [+] Other Impediments
===================================================================

A. Physical Limitation to Support CPU Hotplug: (Architectural Constraint)
   1. ARMv8 CPU architecture does not support the concept of the physical CPU
      hotplug. 
      a. There are many per-CPU components like PMU, SVE, MTE, Arch timers, etc.,
         whose behavior needs to be clearly defined when the CPU is hot(un)plugged.
         There is no specification for this.

   2. Other ARM components like GIC, etc., have not been designed to realize
      physical CPU hotplug capability as of now. For example,
      a. Every physical CPU has a unique GICC (GIC CPU Interface) by construct.
         Architecture does not specify what CPU hot(un)plug would mean in
         context to any of these.
      b. CPUs/GICC are physically connected to unique GICR (GIC Redistributor).
         GIC Redistributors are always part of the always-on power domain. Hence,
         they cannot be powered off as per specification.

B. Impediments in Firmware/ACPI (Architectural Constraint)

   1. Firmware has to expose GICC, GICR, and other per-CPU features like PMU,
      SVE, MTE, Arch Timers, etc., to the OS. Due to the architectural constraint
      stated in section A1(a), all interrupt controller structures of
      MADT describing GIC CPU Interfaces and the GIC Redistributors MUST be
      presented by firmware to the OSPM during boot time.
   2. Architectures that support CPU hotplug can evaluate the ACPI _MAT method to
      get this kind of information from the firmware even after boot, and the
      OSPM has the capability to process these. ARM kernel uses information in MADT
      interrupt controller structures to identify the number of present CPUs during
      boot and hence does not allow to change these after boot. The number of
      present CPUs cannot be changed. It is an architectural constraint!

C. Impediments in KVM to Support Virtual CPU Hotplug (Architectural Constraint)

   1. KVM VGIC:
      a. Sizing of various VGIC resources like memory regions, etc., related to
         the redistributor happens only once and is fixed at the VM init time
         and cannot be changed later after initialization has happened.
         KVM statically configures these resources based on the number of vCPUs
         and the number/size of redistributor ranges.
      b. Association between vCPU and its VGIC redistributor is fixed at the
         VM init time within the KVM, i.e., when redistributor iodevs gets
         registered. VGIC does not allow to setup/change this association
         after VM initialization has happened. Physically, every CPU/GICC is
         uniquely connected with its redistributor, and there is no
         architectural way to set this up.
   2. KVM vCPUs:
      a. Lack of specification means destruction of KVM vCPUs does not exist as
         there is no reference to tell what to do with other per-vCPU
         components like redistributors, arch timer, etc.
      b. In fact, KVM does not implement the destruction of vCPUs for any
         architecture. This is independent of whether the architecture
         actually supports CPU Hotplug feature. For example, even for x86 KVM
         does not implement the destruction of vCPUs.

D. Impediments in Qemu to Support Virtual CPU Hotplug (KVM Constraints-&gt;Arch)

   1. Qemu CPU Objects MUST be created to initialize all the Host KVM vCPUs to
      overcome the KVM constraint. KVM vCPUs are created and initialized when Qemu
      CPU Objects are realized. But keeping the QOM CPU objects realized for
      'yet-to-be-plugged' vCPUs can create problems when these new vCPUs shall
      be plugged using device_add and a new QOM CPU object shall be created.
   2. GICV3State and GICV3CPUState objects MUST be sized over *possible vCPUs*
      during VM init time while QOM GICV3 Object is realized. This is because
      KVM VGIC can only be initialized once during init time. But every
      GICV3CPUState has an associated QOM CPU Object. Later might correspond to
      vCPU which are 'yet-to-be-plugged' (unplugged at init).
   3. How should new QOM CPU objects be connected back to the GICV3CPUState
      objects and disconnected from it in case the CPU is being hot(un)plugged?
   4. How should 'unplugged' or 'yet-to-be-plugged' vCPUs be represented in the
      QOM for which KVM vCPU already exists? For example, whether to keep,
       a. No QOM CPU objects Or
       b. Unrealized CPU Objects
   5. How should vCPU state be exposed via ACPI to the Guest? Especially for
      the unplugged/yet-to-be-plugged vCPUs whose CPU objects might not exist
      within the QOM but the Guest always expects all possible vCPUs to be
      identified as ACPI *present* during boot.
   6. How should Qemu expose GIC CPU interfaces for the unplugged or
      yet-to-be-plugged vCPUs using ACPI MADT Table to the Guest?

E. Summary of Approach ([+] Workarounds to problems in sections A, B, C &amp; D)

   1. At VM Init, pre-create all the possible vCPUs in the Host KVM i.e., even
      for the vCPUs which are yet-to-be-plugged in Qemu but keep them in the
      powered-off state.
   2. After the KVM vCPUs have been initialized in the Host, the KVM vCPU
      objects corresponding to the unplugged/yet-to-be-plugged vCPUs are parked
      at the existing per-VM &quot;kvm_parked_vcpus&quot; list in Qemu. (similar to x86)
   3. GICV3State and GICV3CPUState objects are sized over possible vCPUs during
      VM init time i.e., when Qemu GIC is realized. This, in turn, sizes KVM VGIC
      resources like memory regions, etc., related to the redistributors with the
      number of possible KVM vCPUs. This never changes after VM has initialized.
   4. Qemu CPU objects corresponding to unplugged/yet-to-be-plugged vCPUs are
      released post Host KVM CPU and GIC/VGIC initialization.
   5. Build ACPI MADT Table with the following updates:
      a. Number of GIC CPU interface entries (=possible vCPUs)
      b. Present Boot vCPU as MADT.GICC.Enabled=1 (Not hot[un]pluggable) 
      c. Present hot(un)pluggable vCPUs as MADT.GICC.online-capable=1  
         - MADT.GICC.Enabled=0 (Mutually exclusive) [6][7]
	 - vCPU can be ACPI enabled+onlined after Guest boots (Firmware Policy) 
	 - Some issues with above (details in later sections)
   6. Expose below ACPI Status to Guest kernel:
      a. Always _STA.Present=1 (all possible vCPUs)
      b. _STA.Enabled=1 (plugged vCPUs)
      c. _STA.Enabled=0 (unplugged vCPUs)
   7. vCPU hotplug *realizes* new QOM CPU object. The following happens:
      a. Realizes, initializes QOM CPU Object &amp; spawns Qemu vCPU thread.
      b. Unparks the existing KVM vCPU (&quot;kvm_parked_vcpus&quot; list).
         - Attaches to QOM CPU object.
      c. Reinitializes KVM vCPU in the Host.
         - Resets the core and sys regs, sets defaults, etc.
      d. Runs KVM vCPU (created with &quot;start-powered-off&quot;).
	 - vCPU thread sleeps (waits for vCPU reset via PSCI). 
      e. Updates Qemu GIC.
         - Wires back IRQs related to this vCPU.
         - GICV3CPUState association with QOM CPU Object.
      f. Updates [6] ACPI _STA.Enabled=1.
      g. Notifies Guest about the new vCPU (via ACPI GED interface).
	 - Guest checks _STA.Enabled=1.
	 - Guest adds processor (registers CPU with LDM) [3].
      h. Plugs the QOM CPU object in the slot.
         - slot-number = cpu-index {socket, cluster, core, thread}.
      i. Guest online's vCPU (CPU_ON PSCI call over HVC/SMC).
         - KVM exits HVC/SMC Hypercall [5] to Qemu (Policy Check).
         - Qemu powers-on KVM vCPU in the Host.
   8. vCPU hot-unplug *unrealizes* QOM CPU Object. The following happens:
      a. Notifies Guest (via ACPI GED interface) vCPU hot-unplug event.
         - Guest offline's vCPU (CPU_OFF PSCI call over HVC/SMC).
      b. KVM exits HVC/SMC Hypercall [5] to Qemu (Policy Check).
         - Qemu powers-off the KVM vCPU in the Host.
      c. Guest signals *Eject* vCPU to Qemu.
      d. Qemu updates [6] ACPI _STA.Enabled=0.
      e. Updates GIC.
         - Un-wires IRQs related to this vCPU.
         - GICV3CPUState association with new QOM CPU Object is updated.
      f. Unplugs the vCPU.
	 - Removes from slot.
         - Parks KVM vCPU (&quot;kvm_parked_vcpus&quot; list).
         - Unrealizes QOM CPU Object &amp; joins back Qemu vCPU thread.
	 - Destroys QOM CPU object.
      g. Guest checks ACPI _STA.Enabled=0.
         - Removes processor (unregisters CPU with LDM) [3].

(VI) Commands Used
==================

A. Qemu launch commands to init the machine:

    $ qemu-system-aarch64 --enable-kvm -machine virt,gic-version=3 \
      -cpu host -smp cpus=4,maxcpus=6 \
      -m 300M \
      -kernel Image \
      -initrd rootfs.cpio.gz \
      -append &quot;console=ttyAMA0 root=/dev/ram rdinit=/init maxcpus=2 acpi=force&quot; \
      -nographic \
      -bios QEMU_EFI.fd \

B. Hot-(un)plug related commands:

  # Hotplug a host vCPU (accel=kvm):
    $ device_add host-arm-cpu,id=core4,core-id=4

  # Hotplug a vCPU (accel=tcg):
    $ device_add cortex-a57-arm-cpu,id=core4,core-id=4

  # Delete the vCPU:
    $ device_del core4

Sample output on guest after boot:

    $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/possible
    0-5
    $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/present
    0-5
    $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/enabled
    0-3
    $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/online
    0-1
    $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/offline
    2-5

Sample output on guest after hotplug of vCPU=4:

    $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/possible

    0-4
    $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/online
    0-1,4
    $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/offline

(VIII) KNOWN ISSUES
===================

1. Migration has been lightly tested but has been found working.
2. TCG is broken.
3. HVF and qtest are not supported yet.
4. ACPI MADT Table flags [7] MADT.GICC.Enabled and MADT.GICC.online-capable are
   mutually exclusive, i.e., as per the change [6], a vCPU cannot be both
   GICC.Enabled and GICC.online-capable. This means:
      [ Link: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3706">https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3706</a> ]
   a. If we have to support hot-unplug of the cold-booted vCPUs, then these MUST
      be specified as GICC.online-capable in the MADT Table during boot by the
      firmware/Qemu. But this requirement conflicts with the requirement to
      support new Qemu changes with legacy OS that don't understand
      MADT.GICC.online-capable Bit. Legacy OS during boot time will ignore this
      bit, and hence these vCPUs will not appear on such OS. This is unexpected
      behavior.
   b. In case we decide to specify vCPUs as MADT.GICC.Enabled and try to unplug
      these cold-booted vCPUs from OS (which in actuality should be blocked by
      returning error at Qemu), then features like 'kexec' will break.
   c. As I understand, removal of the cold-booted vCPUs is a required feature
      and x86 world allows it.
   d. Hence, either we need a specification change to make the MADT.GICC.Enabled
      and MADT.GICC.online-capable Bits NOT mutually exclusive or NOT support
      the removal of cold-booted vCPUs. In the latter case, a check can be introduced
      to bar the users from unplugging vCPUs, which were cold-booted, using QMP
      commands. (Needs discussion!)
      Please check the patch part of this patch set:
      [hw/arm/virt: Expose cold-booted CPUs as MADT GICC Enabled].
   
      NOTE: This is definitely not a blocker!
5. Code related to the notification to GICV3 about the hot(un)plug of a vCPU event
   might need further discussion.


(IX) THINGS TO DO
=================

1. Fix issues related to TCG/Emulation support. (Not a blocker)
2. Comprehensive Testing is in progress. (Positive feedback from Oracle &amp; Ampere)
3. Qemu Documentation (.rst) needs to be updated.
4. Fix qtest, HVF Support (Future).
5. Update the design issue related to ACPI MADT.GICC flags discussed in known
   issues. This might require UEFI ACPI specification change (Not a blocker).
6. Add ACPI _OSC 'Query' support. Only part of _OSC support exists now. (Not a blocker).

The above is *not* a complete list. Will update later!

Best regards,  
Salil.

(X) DISCLAIMER
==============

This work is an attempt to present a proof-of-concept of the ARM64 vCPU hotplug
implementation to the community. This is *not* production-level code and might
have bugs. Comprehensive testing is being done on HiSilicon Kunpeng920 SoC,
Oracle, and Ampere servers. We are nearing stable code and a non-RFC
version shall be floated soon.

This work is *mostly* in the lines of the discussions that have happened in the
previous years [see refs below] across different channels like the mailing list,
Linaro Open Discussions platform, and various conferences like KVMForum, etc. This
RFC is being used as a way to verify the idea mentioned in this cover letter and
to get community views. Once this has been agreed upon, a formal patch shall be
posted to the mailing list for review.

[The concept being presented has been found to work!]
