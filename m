Sounds great. Let me know. It sounds like then it could make sense to
change the "arm_build_mp_affinity" function signature in file
"target/arm/cpu.c" file to be like this:

uint64_t arm_build_mp_affinity(bool has_smt, int idx, uint8_t clusterz)

I think in all the files where it is invoked it should be possible to
know the SMT status of the cpu using ARMCPU(qemu_get_cpu(cpu)) or
similar. Let me know what you think.

Good point. I have now looked at the TRMs of the a710, neoverse-n2,
neoverse-v2 and they are similar like the ones mentioned in the gitlab
bug ticket i.e., MT bit should be 1, Aff0 should be 0, Aff1 should be
core index, Aff2 should be cluster id.

Let me know what you think. If everything sounds alright, I will try
and post a patch.

Thanks and regards,
Dorjoy.
