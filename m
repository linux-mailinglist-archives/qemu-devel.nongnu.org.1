Thanks, but then this is pretty sad.  I'm surprised aarch64 doesn't have
such requirement to allow some VM config to run across all kinds of hosts.

Yes we don't have issue for the current CI on KVM compatibilities, but QEMU
does matter for sure.

Then we can either (1) add code as Fabiano suggested to choose different
cpu model by adding hack code in qtest, or (2) we simply not support
aarch64 on cross binary test like most of the rest of the arch, but only
support x86, until any arch can provide a stable CPU that support all
config of hosts (we can document it in the CI file).

I'd vote for (2).  Fabiano, do you have any preference?
