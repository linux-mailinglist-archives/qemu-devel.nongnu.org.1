I meant to 'overcome' the constraints by 'relax'. My apologies if there're any caused
confusions. Previously, you had attempt to create all vCPU objects and reuse them when
vCPU hot added. In current implementation, the hotpluggable vCPUs are instantiated and
released pretty soon. I was bringing the third possibility, to avoid instantiating those
hotpluggable vCPU objects, for discussion. In this series, the life cycle of those
hotpluggable vCPU objects are really short. Again, I didn't say we must avoid instantiating
those vCPU objects, I brought the topic ONLY for discussion.

It will be appreciated if more details other than 'an ARM CPU architectural constraint'
can be provided. I don't understand this constrain very well at least.

As mentioned above, the life cycle of those hotpluggable vCPU objects are really
short. They still consume time and memory to instantiate them. If I'm correct,
one of the primary goal for vCPU hotplug feature is to save system boot-up time,
correct?

I tried to explain that vCPU object isn't needed to create and populate vCPU's file
descriptors, as highlight in (1). The information used to create the cold-booted
vCPU-0 can be reused because all vCPUs have same properties and feature set.

hmm, 'finished my review' has been misread frankly. By that, I meant I finished my tests and
provided all the comments I had. Some of them are questions and discussions, which I still need

It's all about the discussion to the possibility to avoid instantiating hotpluggable
vCPU objects.

I was actually trying to ask for your input and feedback. I was hoping your input
to clear my puzzles: why vCPU objects must be in place to create GICv3 object?
Is it possible to create the GICv3 object without those vCPU objects? What kinds
of efforts we need to avoid instantiating those hotpluggable vCPU objects.
The best way perhaps is to find the answer from the code by myself ;-)

Thanks,
Gavin
