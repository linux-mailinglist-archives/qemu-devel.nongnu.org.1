QEMU has qmp commands to query QOM tree, device properties is
likely what you'd be interested with.
Adding new QAPI might be not necessary as long as needed
data point are exposed via device's properties.

And additional properties are relatively cheap, especially if their
names prefixed with 'x-' which by convention means
/internal use, not stable, not ABI/

Well whole qmp tree structure hasn't been declared as ABI (as far as I know),
but it's relatively stable and we try not to mess with it much
(especially for mainstream virt machines), as some external users
might (ab)use it anyway (no promises on QEMU side though).

On contrary QAPI is mostly considered as ABI QEMU provides
to its users with burden to maintain it stability.

If injection script is internal tool to QEMU, it should be fine
for it to use qom introspection to get data and limit QAPI
necessary minimum only.
To make sure it won't be broken silently by 'innocent' QEMU
contributors, have a CI job to make sure that it still works
as intended.

it makes a lot of difference if code is integral part qemu binary,
(less people have to spend time on reviewing it, avoid increasing
attack surface, ... (other made up reasons)).

Implementing shim/proxy in QEMU and putting all error composing logic
into a separate script (even if it's a part QEMU source), shifts
most of the burden to whomever (I'd assume you'd volunteer yourself)
would maintain the script.

If script breaks, it doesn't affect QEMU itself (nor I believe it
should affect release process), script's maintainer(s) can have their
own schedule/process on how to deal with it.

Agreed, it makes much more sense to carry such script as a part of QEMU.
