True, but the original assert at the structure definition would have
fired if I'd actually used the define rather than a number :(

There is definitely more to do here - but fix wants to be on the light
side of all the options.

cxl_component_create_dvsec() is an odd function in general as it has
more code that varies depending on cxl_dev_type than is shared.

So it might just make sense to split it up and provide some more
trivial functions for the header writing. This is a case of code
that has evolved and ended up as a far from ideal solution.

We only carry the DVSECHeader in the structures so that the sizes can
be read against the spec. It makes the code more complex though
so maybe should consider dropping it and making the asserts next
to the structure definitions more complex.

The asserts in existing function can go (checking it fits etc is done
by pcie_add_capability()).

If not need something more like
//awkward naming is because the second cxl needs to be there to match spec.
void cxl_create_pcie_cxl_device_dvsec(CXLComponentState *cxl,
				      CXLDVSECDevice *dvsec)
{
    PCIDevice *pdev = cxl->pdev;
    uint16_t offset = cxl->dvsec_offset;
    uint16_t length = sizeof(*dvsec);
    uint8_t *wmask = pdev->wmask;

    ///next block can probably be a helper or done in a simpler way.
    /// A lot of what we have here is just to let us reuse this first call.
    pcie_add_capability(pdev, PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_DVSEC, 1, offset, length);

    ///These could be done by writing into dvsec, and memcpy ing more
    ///but the offset will be even stranger if we do that.
    pci_set_long(pdev->config + offset + PCIE_DVSEC_HEADER1_OFFSET,
                 (length << 20) | (rev << 16) | CXL_VENDOR_ID);
    pci_set_word(pdev->config + offset + PCIE_DEVSEC_ID_OFFSET,
                 PCIE_CXL_DEVICE_DEVSEC);

    memcpy(pdev->config + offset + sizeof(DVSEC_HEADER),
           (uint8_t *)dvsec + sizeof(DVSECHeader),
           length - sizeof(DVSECHEAEDR));

// all the wmask stuff for this structure.
}


So I'm aiming for more drastic surgery than you were suggesting but
not in the fix!
