I'm not nitipicking on language. I'm pointing out that CANCELLING is a
transitory state, i.e. from migrate_cancel() until migrate_cleanup(),
while FAILED is a terminal state, nothing happens after it.

But fine, I guess it's really only *my* assumptions being broken and not
the ones in the code.

Ok

Nah, let me review the patch properly, please.
