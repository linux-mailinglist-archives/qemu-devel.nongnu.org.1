Yeah. So `first_mapping_index` is the index of the first mapping, each
mapping is a group of clusters that are contiguous in the file.
Its mostly `-1` because the first mapping will have the value set as
`-1` and not its own index, this value will only be set when the file
contain more than one mapping, and this will only happen when you add
clusters to a file that are not contiguous with the existing clusters.

And actually, thanks to that I noticed another bug not fixed in PATCH 3, 
We are doing this check 
`s->current_mapping->first_mapping_index != mapping->first_mapping_index`
to know if we should switch to the new mapping or not. 
If we were reading from the first mapping (`first_mapping_index == -1`)
and we jumped to the second mapping (`first_mapping_index == n`), we
will catch this condition and switch to the new mapping.

But if the file has more than 2 mappings, and we jumped to the 3rd
mapping, we will not catch this since (`first_mapping_index == n`) for
both of them haha. I think a better check is to check the `mapping`
pointer directly. (I'll add it also in the next series together with a
test for it.)

Now that I think more about it, I think this `abort` is actually
correct, the issue though is that the handling around this code is not.

What this `abort` actually does is that it checks.
- if the `mapping->first_mapping_index` is not the same as
  `first_mapping_index`, which **should** happen only in one case, when
  we are handling the first mapping, in that case
  `mapping->first_mapping_index == -1`, in all other cases, the other
  mappings after the first should have the condition true.
- From above, we know that this is the first mapping, so if the offset
  is not `0`, then abort, since this is an invalid state.

This is all good, the issue is that `first_mapping_index` is not set if
we are checking from the middle, the variable `first_mapping_index` is
only set if we passed through the check `cluster_was_modified` with the
first mapping, and in the same function call we checked the other
mappings.

From what I have seen, that doesn't happen since even if you write the
whole file in one go, you are still writing it cluster by cluster, and
the checks happen at that time.
