Rather, refuse the QMP command with an error.

Warnings in QMP are difficult.  It's easy to fail a command, but hard
to print non-fatal messages.  However, I'm not opposed to having a way
to use a QMP query-* command as a followup for the user who is curious
on how many connections a given block export is using (either we can
already query all existing block exports, or that's something that I
should add independent of the new multi-conn setting).
