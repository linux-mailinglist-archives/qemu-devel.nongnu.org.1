I think that's what you meant in the first place so yes Zoltan is my 
"first" name.

Indeed, you are right but maybe less confusing with allocating the struct 
in caller and returning bool from the init+check function. I'll wait for a 
v2 with the changes so far or the next version of the whole series with 
that v2 to look into the rest in detail but I think this goes in the 
direction I imagined. The point is to try to keep the checks for 
overflowing the vram area and using pixmap with fallback at one place to 
avoid duplicating that part and having to check that we got it right at 
multiple places. It's hard enough to do it right once so better reuse that 
everywhere. So try to do this first with just calling this extracted 
do_blt function at every host data flush and see how that works.

If this turns out to have performance issues we can think about how to 
optimise that later. One possibility could be not flushing every 128 bits 
but coalesce one display line but that may not be needed if we just add a 
parameter to the do_blt function to control if it uses pixman and call it 
to use the fallback loop for small blits to avoid the calling overhead of 
pixman. Coalescing may be more difficult for drivers that don't write LAST 
as we don't know when to do the final flush but we may know which is the 
last line so we could revert to not calesce on the last line or something 
like that. But these get too complex so just forget about it now and go 
with the naive way first and see if we need more after that.

BALATON Zoltan
