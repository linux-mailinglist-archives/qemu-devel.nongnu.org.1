Yes, it's a real use case. We do support different storage types and
want to allow users to place the fleecing image on a different storage
than the original image for flexibility.

I ran into the issue when backing up to a target with 1 MiB cluster_size
while using a fleecing image on RBD (which has 4 MiB cluster_size by
default).

In theory, I guess I could look into querying the cluster_size of the
backup target and trying to allocate the fleecing image with a small
enough cluster_size. But not sure if that would work on all storage
combinations, and would require teaching our storage plugin API (which
also supports third-party plugins) to perform allocation with a specific
cluster size. So not an ideal solution for us.

Thanks!

I'll try to implement point 2. That should resolve the issue for our use
case.
