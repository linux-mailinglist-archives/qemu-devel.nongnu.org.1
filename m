Ya, sorry, I guess that was an odd way to describe it.  IIUC we're doing 
sane stuff, it's just that RISC-V has a very different vector masking 
model than other ISAs.  I just said AVX there because I only care about 
the performance on Intel servers, since that's what I run QEMU on.  I'd 
asssume we have similar performance problems on other targets, I just 
haven't looked.

So my worry would be that the RVV things we're doing slowly just don't 
have fast implementations via AVX and thus we run into some intractable 
problems.  That sort of stuff can be really frusturating for an intern, 
as everything's new to them so it can be hard to know when something's 
an optimization dead end.

That said, we're seeing 100x slowdows in microbenchmarks and 10x 
slowdowns in real code, so I think there sholud be some way to do 
better.

Yep, but we have a handful of integer slowdowns too so I think there's 
some meat to chew on here.  The softfloat stuff should be equally slow 
for scalar/vector, so we shouldn't be tripping false positives there.
