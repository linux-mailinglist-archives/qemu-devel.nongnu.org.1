Originally, the thought behind the 5 was more about the case where
DM_MPATH_PROBE_PATHS offlines bad paths, but then another one goes down
before we retry SG_IO, so that it fails again.

But you're right that it would now apply to retrying in a different path
group. The assumption we make would then be that there will be 5 or
fewer path groups with no working path in them (rather than just 5 of
them existing). That doesn't seem like a completely unreasonable
assumption, but maybe we should increase the number now just to be on
the safe side?

Ben, do you have an opinion on this?
