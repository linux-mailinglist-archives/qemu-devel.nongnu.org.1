Looking at how 'DEVICE(obj)->hotplugged' gets set, this logic does
not really need to have a dependancy on Device.

  static void device_initfn(Object *obj)
  {
      DeviceState *dev = DEVICE(obj);

      if (phase_check(PHASE_MACHINE_READY)) {
          dev->hotplugged = 1;
      ...
  }

IOW, we could at least be doing

  object_prop_set_globals(obj, phase_check(PHASE_MACHINE_READY) ? NULL : &error_fatal);

if we wanted this logic in the Object base class, however....

Hmm, to cover  object_add QMP and -object CLI, we could just put
setting of global props into the object_new_with_prop{s,v} method,
which would deal with usage of user creatable objects, and a few
internal calls which handle errors.

device_add/-device won't hit that code path. Even if we converted
those over to object_new_with_prop{s,v}, that only handles the top
level device. Many devices will create sub-devices behind the scenes
and global properties are supposed to apply to those, and those will
all just be using plain qdev_new().

I guess the challenge is that we then need to be confident that the
state change is effected everywhere it needs to be, which sounds like
another bit of hairy work unless we can limit the scope.

We could do

  * Add globals support to  object_new_with_prop{s,v}
  * Convert Accel creation over to object_new_with_prop{s,v},
  * Records errors setting globals in device_post_init in a
    field in DeviceState
  * Make qdev_realize() check for & report the error from
    the step above, before doing its normal logic

IOW, going forward we have two patterns

  * Creation uses object_new_with_prop{s,v} and has globals
    set that way (preferred). Works for -object, -accel,
    object_add and some internal direct API calls

  * Creation uses a post-init hook, but the type has to have
    some state change equivalent to 'realized' to do delayed
    reporting of globals errors (discouraged, ideally only
    for Device). Works for -device, device_add

With regards,
Daniel
