With the or1k-sim board it is not possible.  Traditionally on or1k we use
special NOP instructions to reboot simulators i.e. 'l.nop 1'.  The QEMU team was
not happy to support this mechanism.

  https://lore.kernel.org/openrisc/fb69c137317a365dcb549dfef1ecd2fbff48e92c.1492384862.git.shorne@gmail.com/T/#mef76d30d294aed84548b1e0d3e23aae499deaeec

As an alertnative we can use the 'virt' board which supports shutdown and
restart via the generic syscon drivers.

    $ grep -C1 SYSCON arch/openrisc/configs/virt_defconfig
    CONFIG_POWER_RESET=y
    CONFIG_POWER_RESET_SYSCON=y
    CONFIG_POWER_RESET_SYSCON_POWEROFF=y
    CONFIG_SYSCON_REBOOT_MODE=y
    # CONFIG_HWMON is not set

That looks good. I need to work on getting my integration testing better, Ill
look into your tools for that.
