So, to sum up, get rid of the 'g_assert_not_reached()' stubs since they should
be cropped by well placed kvm_enabled() calls in the code and, if that's not
the case, a non-KVM build failure will let us know that there's something wrong.

I can live with that. It's less code to deal with in the header as well. Thanks,
