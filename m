that's not how I read spec:

"
AMD64 Architecture Programmer=E2=80=99s Manual Volume 3: General-Purpose an=
d System Instructions
24594=E2=80=94Rev. 3.36=E2=80=94March 2024
...
Appendix E Obtaining Processor Information Via the CPUID Instruction
...
All bit positions that are not defined as fields are
reserved. The value of bits within reserved ranges cannot be relied upon to=
 be zero.
Software must mask off all reserved bits in the return value prior to makin=

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
information.
...
E.3.6 Function 7h=E2=80=94Structured Extended Feature Identifiers
...
The value returned in EDX is undefined and is reserved.
"

what actually happens is guest side being lazy and blindly following CPUID.

one can say both guest and hypervisor are to blame,
  1st is not masking reserved bits
  2nd provides 'hybrid' cpu that doesn't exists in real world,
  but then 'host' cpu model has never been the exact match for physical cpu.

what I dislike is ad-hoc fixups in generic code,=20
if consensus were to implement _out of spec_ fixup for already fixed issue =
in Windows,
it should be better be done in host cpumodel code.

Or even better a single KVM optin feature 'do_not_advertise_features_not_su=
pported_by_host_cpu',
and then QEMU could use that for disabling all nonsense in one go.
Plus all of that won't be breaking KVM ABI nor qemu had to add fixups for t=
his and that feature.

After some time when old machine types are deprecated/gone, KVM could make =
it default and eventually
remove advertising 'fake' features.

PS:
On QEMU side we usually tolerant to such fixups if it's not fixable on gues=
t side.
but that's not the case here.
