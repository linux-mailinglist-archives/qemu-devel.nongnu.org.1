virtio can support the second option, we already have
VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_SHARED_MEMORY_CFG, I'd just use it.

This part is classic for pci, mapping pci bar has been well
studied.

I would however worry that with all this pass through,
applications have to be coded to each hypervisor or even
version of the hypervisor.

I don't really know the use-case well enough - is sending
an interrupt to linux and having linux create a device
independent structure not workable?

virtio config space, which is just a region in a BAR.
But yes, maybe VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_SHARED_MEMORY_CFG is cleaner.

virtio has been developed with the painful experience that we keep
making mistakes, or coming up with new needed features,
and that maintaining forward and backward compatibility
becomes a whole lot harder than it seems in the beginning.
