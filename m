Yes, for this case, many PMU related CPUIDs have already been disabled
because of "!enable_pmu", so IMO it's not necessary to handle other PMU
MSRs.

Strictly speaking, only the earlier AMD PMUs are still AVAILABLE at this
point, as the other platforms, have CPUIDs to indicate PMU enablement.
So for the latter (which I understand is most of the cases nowadays),
there's no reason to assume that the PMUs are still working when the CPUIDs
are corrupted...

There is no perfect solution for pre-v5.18 kernel... But while not breaking
compatibility, again IMO, we need the logic to be self-consistent, i.e.
any time the user does not enable vPMU (enable_pmu = false), it should be
assumed that vPMU does not work.

Thanks,
Zhao
