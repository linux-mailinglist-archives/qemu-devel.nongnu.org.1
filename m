Wanting people to register a device ID is a social problem and
we're trying to apply a technical hammer to it, which is rarely
an productive approach.

If we want to demonstrate that vhost-user-device is "risky", then
how about we rename it to have an 'x-' prefix and thus disclaim
any support for it, but none the less allow its use. Document it
as an experimental device, and if it breaks, users get to keep
both pieces.

It seems like it would be useful before any virtio spec submission
as a mechanism by which users can experiment to finese their ideas
prior to getting to the point of needing to make a spec proposal.

With regards,
Daniel
