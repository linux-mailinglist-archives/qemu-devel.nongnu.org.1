Hi, Pierrick,

The motivation for this API is a plugin that simulates a RISC-V tracing
unit (and produces a trace). For that we actually also needed to
track the "regular" control flow, i.e. find out whether a branch was
taken or where a jump went. That wasn't hard, especially considering
that the TCG API already gives you (more or less) basic blocks. Still,
we ended up tracing every instruction because that made some of the logic
much simpler and easier to reason about.

We realized that we need a trap API because they:
* can occur at any time/point of execusion
* usually come with additional effects such as mode changes.

Helpers for discerning whether an instruction is a jump, a branch
instruction or something else would certainly be helpful if you wanted
cross-platform control flow tracing of some sort, but afaik given such
helpers you would just need to check the last instruction in a
translation block and check where the PC goes after that. Additional
callbacks for specifically this situation strike me as a bit
excessive.

But I could be wrong about that.

Regards,
Julian
