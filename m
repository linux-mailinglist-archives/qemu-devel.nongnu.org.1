Why shouldn't this be allowed ?

IIUC, a profile is syntactic sugar for a group of features. If
we can disable individual features explicitly, why should we
not allow use of the profile as sugar to disable them en-mass ?


BTW, I would caution that the semantics of mixing groups of
features, with individual features in -cpu is likely to be
ill defined, as you cannot rely on left-to-right processing
of the -cpu arguments.

IOW, if you say  -cpu $foo,$group=on,$feature=off

you might expect this to result in '$feature' being disabled
if it were implied by $group. This is not guaranteed as the
QDict processing of options could result in us effectively
processing   -cpu $foo,$feature=off,$group=on

This brokeness with CPU feature groups and their interaction
with CPU feature flags already impacts s390x:

  https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2023-09/msg00981.html

There is a possible way to fix it by declaring an ordering
such that all groups will be processed fully, before any
individual features are processed, and declaring that group
or feature names must not be repeated. This avoids a reliance
on left-to-right ordering:

  https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2023-09/msg01005.html

that is still likely broken, however, if multiple different
groups are listed, and there is overlap in their feature
sets.

TL;DR: feature groups are pretty error prone if more than
one is listed by the user, or they're combined with individual
features.

Why shouldn't this be allowed ?
