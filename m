Yes, ideally, but there are still gaps between the python tooling ecosystem
and our own conventions in the QEMU source tree. Saying "everything under
python/ should adhere to python ecosystem conventions" was just an
extremely convenient way to make python tooling not throw a hissy fit over
stuff in that directory. The "make" targets in that directory are really
just simple script invocations that we don't really need "make" for at all,
it's just so I don't have to re-explain how to invoke the tests as they
stand. I don't think it's "outdated" in that sense, it's just a nice little
syntactic shorthand using a tool people are familiar with - not too far out
from what we do for the VM tests.

One of the barriers to implementing this in "make check" et al is setting
up the package installation needed for e.g. mypy and the optional feature
packages (like urwid, fusepy, etc) in a way that is unobtrusive to the
build system. The build-time configure venv was a step in that direction,
but the work remains unfinished.

I am in the process (right now!) of setting up mkvenv to install the
in-tree python packages to the configure venv - one of the barriers *here*
is that this is a little bit slow with older setuptools, and due to very
tumultuous changes in Python packaging in the last several years (fallout
from PEP-517, PEP-518 and PEP-660) is that it is taking me a good long
while to ensure it's rock solid across all of our supported platforms while
supporting isolated offline builds. (Python stuff was really, really,
really not designed to cope very well with that restriction, I have learned
in the last few years.)

Another reason for the decision to treat the python/ subdirectory as a
"mini-repository" was purely for sake of ease with splitting out
subpackages that became useful beyond the confines of our castle walls:
qemu.qmp in particular. By structuring everything here like an upstream
package, it becomes pretty trivial to fork things out into standalone
packages, because they're already structured identically to how standalone
packages would be.

TLDR: "It makes my life easier to follow python ecosystem norms in this
directory, but I still want to integrate it more formally to the QEMU build
system and am working on that."

Maybe someday.

Right now, I consider anything under python/ to be "maintained" for the
python ecosystem and anything outside of this to be "good luck!".

I do not volunteer to apply the same level of effort I do for python/ to
*every last python script in the tree*. The standards I apply in python/
are vastly more strict than those that could apply to everything else; I
don't think I could handle the workload of polishing every last python
thing in the tree up to the same standard. qemu.qmp, qemu.machine and qapi
are just vastly more important than the majority of one-off scripts that
automate niche tasks I have no domain expertise in.

For any python scripts with import dependencies on other in-tree modules,
it is useful to structure those imported modules as normal packages so that
mypy, pylint, etc can function with minimal fuss and without needing lots
of prone-to-breakage environment hacks and custom launcher scripts to make
them work. Anything that *doesn't* need to import anything else from the
tree is relatively easy to check where it lives, I just don't do that at
the moment. It's possible we could make a separate test that applies a much
lower bar of type checking and linting that really only catches *hard*
errors and applies to everything in the tree automatically, but I don't
think I want to lower the bar for the stuff already in python/.

That said, I *do* want to move the python tests into our usual build
testing infrastructure, there's just some more work to do with mkvenv to
bridge the gap, which I'm working on currently.
