I think you have a fair amount of ideas and opinions on how to handle the=
=20
RAPL in QEMU and that's really good for improving the features.=20

What I would really like is to have Paolo's opinions on all of that. When=
=20
I started working on the subject I talked to him several time and we=20
agreed on the current implementation.=20

Not that I disagree with all you said, to the contrary, but the amount=20
of change is quite significant and it would be very annoying if results=20
of this work doesn't make upstream because of Y & X.

Let's see if we have more opinions from the people in the loop as well.

Thanks for feedback.

Anthony
