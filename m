Hi Markus,

Thanks for the detailed review.

Fan is traveling for a few weeks and may have intermittent internet.
He asked me to help with any feedback that came in during this period.

Perhaps at this stage (as Michael has this queued) best bet is a follow on patch
tweaking things.  The blast radius is more or less contained to the
qmp file subject to a few parameter type changes.  I'd be keen on this
approach if possible because that lets me start attacking the annoyingly
large queue of stuff dependent on this series in parallel with
improving this aspect.

Proposed draft patch at end of this email and responses to individual
comments inline.

I'll do a separate patch in response to your suggestion to mark the
two interfaces unstable.  For now seems there is little disadvantage
in doing so as I assume there is nothing stopping us removing
that marking in a cycle or two if things look stable.

Yes.  Probably makes more sense to add to the initial description rather
than down here.

# A single dynamic capacity extent.  This is a contiguous allocation
# of memory by Device Physical Address within a single Dynamic Capacity
# Region on a CXL Type 3 device.

This is all a bit of a balance between not quoting large chunks of
the specification and providing enough detail here.
Reality is that people who don't know what this is, won't use this
interface.  We can add some additional documentation to introduce
all the concepts but it probably doesn't make sense to do so here.

Sadly not that simple, hence the desire for an abbreviation. Should be

Compute Express Link (CXL) Specification, Revision 3.1, Version 1.0

Can drop the Version 1.0 (as there have never been other versions and
probably won't be) but the Revision part matters (unfortunately)
hence the r in the above.

Not that we've used CXL r3.0 etc in previous QMP docs for this. Perhaps
just sticking to that and relying on the reference in
docs/system/devices/cxl.rst for the canonical reference.

For now I'll go with the (almost) full form here as it's never wrong to
spell it out.  So all the new references will be to
Compute Express Link (CXL) Specification, Revision 3.1, Section xxxx

@free: Device is responsible for allocating the requested memory
     capacity and is free to do this using any combination of
     supported extents.

@contiguous: Device is responsible for allocating the requested
     memory capacity but must do so as a single contiguous
     extent.

@prescriptive: The precise set of extents to be allocated is specified
     by the command.  Thus allocation is being managed by the
     issuer of the allocation command, not the device.

@enable-shared-access: Capacity has already been allocated to a
     different host using free, contiguous or prescriptive methods with
     a known tag. This policy then instructs the device to make the
     capacity with the specified tag available to an additional host.
     Capacity is implicit as it matches that already associated with the
     tag. Note that the extent list (and hence DPAs)
     used are per host, so a device may use different representations
     on each host. The ordering of the extents provided to each host
     is indicated to the host using per extent sequence numbers generated
     by the device. Has a similar
     meaning for temporal sharing but in that case there may be only
     one host involved.

The full flow can fail, in the sense that the host can reject the offered
capacity.
This command just initiates the flow.

Today we can't detect it via QMP. There are a could of options but I
think they are out of scope for this document (for now).
There are a lot more DCD features to come and I'd include a
resolution to this aspect as one of those.  Aim today is just
to get to the point where we can test the OS handling - other
cases like virtualization of this require a lot more infrastructure
on top of what we have here.

So likely options:

* The 'fabric manager' will have an out of band path to the OS as it
  doesn't spontaneously decide to offer capacity - that happens
  because an orchestrator (think kubernetes or similar) has told a
  host to bring up an application that needs this extra capacity.
  That path would typically include an acknowledgment that the capacity
  has turned up and the host can run what it was asked to run.

  There is an inband path for a real fabric manager interface that
  we don't yet have an equivalent of in QEMU. An earlier version
  of this patch set provided a hacky equivalent so was dropped.
  That path is the Fabric Manager side Dynamic Capacity Event Log
  which has events for this
 0x4 Add Capacity Response:
" The host has responded to the Add Capacity event and the Dynamic
  Capacity Extent field in this structure specifies the capacity
  accepted by the host.  This event shall only be reported
  to the FM"
0x5 is the similar one for release.

So long term there is probably a need for a reporting interface
but lots more to do in general and I think this is functional
without that.  For now I think all we can do is document that
discovering success must be done via an out of band interface.

I've added:
" Note that, currently, establishing success or failure of the full Add Dynamic
  Capacity flow requires out of band communication with the OS of
  the CXL host."

Does that work for now?  We will have to remember to update if/when
we add a way to query this.

Also clear we could benefit from some additional documentation
in cxl.rst.  That's a job for another day however - for now to
get the details users will have to read the CXL specification or
may watch a bunch of conference videos and webinars at least.
 

> 
> How long until completion after the command succeeded?  Unbounded time?

Depends on the host, and indeed unbounded - ultimately there is an abort
path (forced removal later in this doc) but it is sometimes fatal for the
OS running and only meant for the case where the host OS crashed.
Not many operating systems play well with force removal of memory and due
to a race condition it may looks like that to the host.  So basically
it's a 'don't use this' kind of hardware feature.

However it's not that QEMU is waiting for it beyond  having some tracking
structures allocated that are not freed until the flow has finished.
This is very much an an asynchronous flow.

Sure. Hopefully fixed throughout the new text. I've not taken
on the existing cases today.

That text LGTM. I'll focus only on new cases of this for an initial
patch but there are a load of other cases of this text that will
want updating separately.

Sure, I guess because nearly everything else is just a spec reference

Effectively same reply.  Today you can only do this via out of band
comms with the host.  We have quite a lot more to add before we
can report this via QMP. This is very much part 1 of DCD support,
I'd expect us to be still adding features in a year or more.

I'll add similar text to proposed for the add path.

For one meaning of scrubbing.  Not the one that is normally applied to
memory which is patrol scrub / ECC error detection and correction and
subject to a long kernel mailing list thread at the moment and another
QEMU patch set on my queue..  

Why can't we have a be dictionary of canonical terms. Ah well.
Added a slightly shortened quote from the CXL spec.
"This Ensures that all user data and metadata is made permanently
 unavailable by whatever means is appropriate for the media type.
 Note that changing encryption keys is not sufficient."

The last bit is because we will shortly have secure erase support
via another patch set and in that case changing encryption keys is
sufficient.

So with all that incorporated, what I currently have is:



[PATCH] hw/cxl/events: Improve QMP interfaces and documentation for add/release dynamic capacity.

New DCD command definitions updated in response to review comments
from Markus.

- Used CxlXXXX instead of CXLXXXXX for newly added types.
- Expanded some abreviations in type names to be easier to read.
- Additional documentation for some fields.
- Replace slightly vague cxl r3.1 references with
  "Compute Express Link (CXL) Specification, Revision 3.1, XXXX"
  to bring them inline with what it says on the specification cover.

I can break this up into a separate patches, but that's going to be
