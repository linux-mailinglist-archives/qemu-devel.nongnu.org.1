New DCD command definitions updated in response to review comments
from Markus.

- Used CxlXXXX instead of CXLXXXXX for newly added types.
- Expanded some abreviations in type names to be easier to read.
- Additional documentation for some fields.
- Replace slightly vague cxl r3.1 references with
  "Compute Express Link (CXL) Specification, Revision 3.1, XXXX"
  to bring them inline with what it says on the specification cover.

I can break this up into a separate patches, but that's going to be
quite a lot of churn as often multiple of the above affect the same
paragraph.
