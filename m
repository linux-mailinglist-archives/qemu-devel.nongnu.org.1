This was with noVNC. A colleague tested with TigerVNC. I haven't stepped
through with GDB there, but it might be similar. No, I haven't
reported/investigated for the VNC clients yet. Unfortunately, I've got
my hands full with other things at the moment, so it will be a while
until I can do that.

Even if it's a bug in the clients, this was working before d921fea338
("ui/vnc-clipboard: fix infinite loop in inflate_buffer
(CVE-2023-3255)") so I still feel like it might be worth handling in QEMU.

But is it really a client error? What I don't understand is why the
return value of inflate() is Z_BUF_ERROR even though all the input was
handled.

From https://www.zlib.net/manual.html

"inflate() returns [...] Z_BUF_ERROR if no progress was possible or if
there was not enough room in the output buffer when Z_FINISH is used."

Progress was made and there was enough space for the output (avail_out =
7 after the call), so it really shouldn't return Z_BUF_ERROR, right?

zlib version is 1:1.2.13.dfsg-1 (Debian 12 Bookworm)
