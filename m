Yes, the major goal is to keep it a single binary.

We can make it two levels.  However if so I'd rather reuse -m, then we keep
"-m quick" for tcg, "-m slow" for tcg+kvm.  We can move the current "slow
tests" into another env var: basically those ones (dirtylimit, auto
converge, xbzrle, iirc) and FLAKY ones won't be run by anyone but us.

I was thinking there's no way in CI that it can be done separately.  But
yeah I don't know well on CI.. so if it can happen easily that's a problem.

IIUC we're only talking about "meson test" behavior, I assume
migration-test should be mostly unaffected on how it'll be used, except
that indeed we're changing "how to define quick/slow tests".  More below.

So IMHO we could go "-m slow | -m thorough" here, as mentioned above, just
to avoid making it a matrix of (--full, -m) combinations.

Then move all old slow tests into (just to avoid using "slow" as a word):

  if (getenv("QEMU_MIG_TEST_EXTRA")) ...

And rename FLAKY into:

  if (getenv("QEMU_MIG_TEST_FLAKY")) ...

Then we test it with QEMU_MIG_TEST_FLAKY=1 and QEMU_MIG_TEST_EXTRA=1 if we
want all tests.

I failed to follow here.  Our CI doesn't hardcode any <test_name>, right?
It should invoke "migration-test" in the old build, feeding new QEMU binary
to it, run whatever are there in the old test.

So I could have missed something above, and I can understand this adds
burden to bisections.  However I do prefer we can change test path any way
we want (even if in most cases we shouldn't ever touch them, and we should
still try to not change them as frequent).  IOW we also need to consider
