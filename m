Please bare with me, as I know little on rdma stuff.

I'm actually pretty confused (and since a long time ago..) on why we need
to operation with rdma contexts when ipoib seems to provide all the tcp
layers.  I meant, can it work with the current "tcp:" protocol with ipoib
even if there's rdma/ib hardwares underneath?  Is it because of performance
improvements so that we must use a separate path comparing to generic
"tcp:" protocol here?

Can you elaborate the problems, and why tcp won't work in this case?  They
may not be directly relevant to the issue we're discussing, but I'm happy
to learn more.

What is the NICs you were testing before?  Did the test carry out with
things like modern ones (50Gbps-200Gbps NICs), or the test was done when
these hardwares are not common?

Per my recent knowledge on the new Intel hardwares, at least the ones that
support QPL, it's easy to achieve single core 50Gbps+.

https://lore.kernel.org/r/PH7PR11MB5941A91AC1E514BCC32896A6A3342@PH7PR11MB5941.namprd11.prod.outlook.com

Quote from Yuan:

  Yes, I use iperf3 to check the bandwidth for one core, the bandwith is 60Gbps.
  [ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bitrate         Retr  Cwnd
  [  5]   0.00-1.00   sec  7.00 GBytes  60.1 Gbits/sec    0   2.87 MBytes
  [  5]   1.00-2.00   sec  7.05 GBytes  60.6 Gbits/sec    0   2.87 Mbytes

  And in the live migration test, a multifd thread's CPU utilization is almost 100%

It boils down to what old problems were there with tcp first, though.

Yes, please cc whoever might be interested (or surprised.. :) to know this,
and let's be open to all possibilities.

I don't think it makes sense if there're a lot of users of a feature then
we deprecate that without a good reason.  However there's always the
resource limitation issue we're facing, so it could still have the
possibility that this gets deprecated if nobody is working on our upstream
branch. Say, if people use private branches anyway to support rdma without
collaborating upstream, keeping such feature upstream then may not make
much sense either, unless there's some way to collaborate.  We'll see.

It seems there can still be people joining this discussion.  I'll hold off
a bit on merging this patch to provide enough window for anyone to chim in.
