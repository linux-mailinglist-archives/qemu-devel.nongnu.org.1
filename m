I forgot to add  :

      * guide on how to use this new feature from QEMU and libvirt.
        something we can refer to for tests. That's a must have.
      * usage scenarios
        There are some benefits but it is not obvious a user would
        like to use multiple VFs in one VM, please explain.
        This is a major addition which needs justification anyhow
      * pros and cons

> I'm not sure what descriptions you exactly want in these places, 

Looking from the VFIO subsystem, the way this series works is very opaque.
There are a couple of a new migration handlers, new threads, new channels,
etc. It has been discussed several times with migration folks, please provide
a summary for a new reader as ignorant as everyone would be when looking at
a new file.

That's the risk of not getting any ! and the initial proposal should be
discussed before code freeze.

For the general framework, I was expecting an extension of a "multifd"
subsection under :

   https://qemu.readthedocs.io/en/v9.2.0/devel/migration/features.html

but it doesn't exist :/

So, for now, let's use the new "multifd" subsection of

   https://qemu.readthedocs.io/en/v9.2.0/devel/migration/vfio.html

Patch 34, not sure yet.

Patch 35 is for next cycle IMO.

For QEMU 10.0, let's focus on x86 first and see how it goes. We can add
ARM support in QEMU 10.1 if nothing new arises. We will need the virt-arm
folks in cc: then.

Please keep patch 35 in v6 nevertheless, it is good for reference if
someone wants to apply on an out of tree QEMU.


Thanks,

C.
