In my mind, it's a function which must not return None, which makes it
useful. If it has different failure modes for different arguments,
that doesn't matter much to me. Assertions for programmer errors and
QAPISemError for semantic errors seems fine.

It also completely obscures what has actually failed with a pretty
unreadable error. It's a programmer error, sure, but I'm a programmer
and I hate being inconvenienced. (I have tripped on this bomb multiple
times while writing this series.)

OK, so I'll just keep the single new assert for this patch ...

It's already not *strictly* used for that, though, because of (C) in
particular. We have a lot less *goop* at the callsite by just teaching
resolve_type to understand which case it is being used for and
adapting it to raise the correct error in response (Assertion for
programmer failure, QAPISemError for semantic error.)

Yeah. It's goopy. I don't like the goop.

In my mind:

(1) resolve_type: idiomatic python for type resolution; Exception one
way or another if we fail.
(2) lookup_type: C-brained type resolution, return None if we fail and
make it the caller's problem to perform due diligence.

It'd cut down on the goop. Not convinced we need yet-another-helper (I
even dropped my patch refactoring these because I decided it wasn't
worth it), but if you would *really* like to maintain some semantic
difference between lookup/resolve beyond the return type, I'll
probably go this route because I think it makes callsites the
cleanest.

Yes, it just would help sweep all of the dirt into a more consolidated
location. Trying to audit when and where info can be None takes more
brain cycles than I'd prefer. I'm not advocating for it to happen in
this series, I am just advocating for it to happen.
