I think, in bdrv_co_get_allocated_file_size() we go to

     } else if (drv->is_filter) {
         /* Filter drivers default to the size of their filtered child */
         return bdrv_co_get_allocated_file_size(bdrv_filter_bs(bs));

branch, bdrv_filter_bs(bs) returns NULL for detached filter, and then
we crash on trying to dereference NULL pointer in

int64_t coroutine_fn bdrv_co_get_allocated_file_size(BlockDriverState *bs)
{
     BlockDriver *drv = bs->drv;

.

So, something like
--- a/block.c
+++ b/block.c
@@ -6024,6 +6024,12 @@ int64_t coroutine_fn bdrv_co_get_allocated_file_size(BlockDriverState *bs)
           */
          return -ENOTSUP;
      } else if (drv->is_filter) {
+        BlockDriverState *filtered = bdrv_filter_bs(bs);
+
+        if (!filtered) {
+            return -ENOMEDIUM;
+        }
+
          /* Filter drivers default to the size of their filtered child */
          return bdrv_co_get_allocated_file_size(bdrv_filter_bs(bs));
      } else {

should help.

I think, if it feasible to fix the problem in generic code, it's better than
work-around in specific job-type.

On the other hand, we already have similar block_job_remove_all_bdrv() calls
in backup and mirror, and it works well. So we can proceed with this patch too,
just add a comment, that we are avoiding invalid block graph state by having
detached filter, which leads to crashes, because generic code is unprepared
to detached filters.
