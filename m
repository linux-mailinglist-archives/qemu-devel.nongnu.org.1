In theory, the old plan was that eventually qcow2 would use fine grained
locks instead of the single s->lock, and having a separate cache lock
would be a step towards it. But if we never actually make use of it to
hold s->lock for a shorter time, that's not really a good argument. I'm
not sure if that's ever going to happen unless for a rewrite in Rust or
something.

I never tried to measure specifically if lock contention is a problem
with high queue depth and random I/O on a huge disk. Intuitively,
holding s->lock while doing I/O for loading entries into the cache can't
be really good.

Anyway, I went a bit on a tangent there...

I think creating a coroutine in cache_clean_timer_cb() is the wrong
approach. Instead, cache_clean_timer_init() could create a coroutine
and its implementation could be something like this:

    while (!s->cache_clean_timer_stopping) {
        qemu_co_sleep_ns_wakeable(&s->cache_clean_timer_wake,
                                  QEMU_CLOCK_VIRTUAL,
                                  s->cache_clean_interval * NANOSECONDS_PER_SECOND);

        qemu_co_mutex_lock(&s->lock);
        qcow2_cache_clean_unused(s->l2_table_cache);
        qcow2_cache_clean_unused(s->refcount_block_cache);
        qemu_co_mutex_unlock(&s->lock);
    }
    s->cache_clean_timer_stopping = false;

Polling in a coroutine_fn is verboten.

If we do need this function, I think it would be a yield here and a wake
on the other side. I think we might be able to get around it if we move
the call from qcow2_do_open() into qcow2_open() (i.e. outside the
coroutine). A bit ugly, so your choice.

I think the del/init pair here won't be necessary any more after
switching to the background coroutine. It will just start using the new
value of s->cache_clean_interval the next time it sleeps.
