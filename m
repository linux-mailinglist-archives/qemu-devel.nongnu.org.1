I believe for matching requirements, ordering of paragraphs must
be a fixed per:

  https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/license-matching-guidelines-and-templates/#b32-guideline-verbatim-text

In terms of lists, however, they permit the numbers to be substituted
by bullets and vica-verca per

 https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/license-matching-guidelines-and-templates/#b8-bullets-and-numbering

> I assume we agree that the first three clauses match BSD-3-Clause.

There are some slight wording differences in the first 2 clauses,
but IMHO they don't make a semantic difference.

For BSD-3-Clause-Modification it currently defines the 4th clause
as

  If any files are modified, you must cause the modified files to
  carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and
  the date of any change.

vs this file

  Modification of any or all of the source code, documentation and other
  materials provided under this license are subject to acknowledgement of
  the modification(s) by including a prominent notice on the modification(s)
  stating the change(s) to the file(s), identifying the date of such change
  and stating the name of the publisher of any such modification(s).

Even though (IMHO) the legal implications are basically equivalent,
under the SPDX matching guidelines I don't think we can consider
this a match.

I'm afraid that's not how SPDX license clauses work - the text of
the license in the file needs to match one specific SPDX license,
modulo fuzzy matching to the extent documented in the links above.

The quickest option is almost certainly to get this reviewed by
SPDX team as a new BSD variant.

Is there a canonical link where this license originates from ?

In terms of this QEMU series, I don't consider this a hard blocker,
as we can work through it asynchronously.

With regards,
Daniel
