Thanks for sharing how A20 gets handled in VIA=2E Both ICH9 and PIIX work =
in a similar manner, where the A20 bits of port 92 and the KBC are logicall=
y ORed, except that they have an "A20GATE" input pin instead of an integrat=
ed KBC=2E This means that for the Intel chips the board needs an extra wire=
 from the KBC to the southbridge to handle A20=2E

Like you say, the correct way of modeling this in QEMU was to move the log=
ic into the southbridges and expose some GPIO pins=2E I'd need to look into=
 that to figure out how well that plays with bringing the VIA southbridges =
to the pc machine=2E Rather than passing port92 through pc_basic_device_ini=
t(), like this series does, it might be possible to just pass the southbrid=
ge instead=2E

One interesting outcome of this series is probably that port 92 gets deact=
ivated through the i8042 option which seems to be more than intended=2E I'd=
 send a patch to fix this=2E
