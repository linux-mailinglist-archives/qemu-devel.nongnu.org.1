Well if you want a simple drive command you need something. For example
on -M virt for aarch64:

  -drive  driver=3Draw,file.driver=3Dhost_device,file.filename=3D/dev/zen-s=
sd2/trixie-arm64,discard=3Dunmap

only really contains backend options. By default this will attach the
block device to the virtio-pci bus, see virt.c:

  mc->block_default_type =3D IF_VIRTIO;

The backend options might look a bit much, a simpler case with qcow2
would be:

  -drive driver=3Dqcow2,file=3Dtrixie-x86_64.qcow2=20

However if you don't have any default bus for your block devices you
must use -device/-blockdev pairs. It doesn't add much:

 -device virtio-scsi-pci \
 -device scsi-hd,drive=3Dhd \
 -blockdev driver=3Draw,node-name=3Dhd,file.driver=3Dhost_device,file.filen=
ame=3D/dev/zen-ssd2/trixie-arm64,discard=3Dunmap \

So all I've added is the bus, a device and then linked them with the
drive/node-name ids.

You shouldn't need to micro manage bus details, you just need to link
the device to the backend via an id.

device and blockdev pairs are required. -drive attempts to do both in
one command line option.

We support a wide variety of boards some with fixed block device buses
and some with the ability to add stuff dynamically. While we certainly
could do better documenting the edge cases (patches welcome ;-) I'm not
sure its possible to come up with a generic command line that works
across all boards. That said any of the VirtIO enabled platforms (often
called virt) will have fairly similar command lines for adding devices
(modulo PCI/MMIO support).

QEMU's command line reputation is not undeserved but it is at least
consistent with the modern composable options. If we can improve the
documentation then let us know:

  https://qemu.readthedocs.io/en/master/system/device-emulation.html

But expanding the use of automagical options is not really a long term
solution.

-append passes options to the kernel command line if you are doing a
direct kernel boot or your firmware supports direct kernel booting.
