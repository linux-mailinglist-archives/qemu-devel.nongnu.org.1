Yes, we shouldn't rely on mental gymnastics to prove that there's no
concurrent access.

@peterx, that RH bug you showed me could very well be caused by this
race, except that I don't see how fd_cleanup could race with
itself. Just having the lock would probably save us time even thinking
about it.

At first sight, it seems like a real problem. We did a good pass on
these races on the source side, but the destination side hasn't been
investigated yet.

Unfortunately, these QEMUFile races are not trivial to fix due to
several design pain points, such as:

- the QEMUFile pointer validity being sometimes used to imply no error
  has happened before;

- the various shutdown() calls that serve both as a way to kick a read()
  that's stuck, but also to cause some other part of the code to realise
  there has been an error (due to the point above);

- the yank feature which has weird semantics regarding whether it
  operates on an iochannel or qemufile;

- migrate_fd_cancel() that _can_ run concurrently with anything else;

- the need to ensure the other end of migration also reacts to
  error/cancel on this side;
