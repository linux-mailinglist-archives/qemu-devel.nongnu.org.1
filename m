split frontend/backend design is established pattern in QEMU, so I'm not
suggesting anything revolutionary (probability that anyone would object
to it is very low).

sending an RFC can serve as a starting point for discussion. =20

yep, given that it would be better to reuse existing power monitoring
projects, it would be nice to hear some feedback from them.=20
