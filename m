Definitely not allow the host to release something it hasn't accepted.
Should allow QMP to release such entrees though (and same for fmapi when
we get there). Any such requested from host should be treated as whatever
it says to do if you release an extent that you don't have.

Absolutely.  I got confused here on who was doing release.
Host definitely can't release stuff it hasn't successfully accepted.
