From: Nicholas Piggin <npiggin@gmail.com>

The reverse-debugging test creates a trace, then replays it and:

1. Steps the first 10 instructions and records their addresses.
2. Steps backward and verifies their addresses match.
3. Runs to (near) the end of the trace.
4. Sets breakpoints on the first 10 instructions.
5. Continues backward and verifies execution stops at the last
   breakpoint.

Step 5 breaks if any of the other 9 breakpoints are re-executed in the
trace after the 10th instruction is run, because those will be
unexpectedly hit when reverse continuing. This situation does arise
with the ppc pseries machine, the SLOF bios branches to its own entry
point.

Deal with this by switching steps 3 and 4, so the trace will be run to
the end *or* one of the breakpoints being re-executed. Step 5 then
reverses from there to the 10th instruction will not hit a breakpoint in
between, by definition.

Another step is added between steps 2 and 3, which steps forward over
the first 10 instructions and verifies their addresses, to support this.
