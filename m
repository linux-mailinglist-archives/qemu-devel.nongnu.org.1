thanks for vdpa ptrs; I have my diff work cut out for me, but heh, I asked for it! :)

ok.  You had mentioned earlier that you used VTD nomenclature, so I should have concluded the same here. /my bad.

So 'flts' is 'first level then switch' .

ok. I don't understand how VFIO & VPDA complicate that add.

I'm looking for a better description that states the AS cache lookup is broadened from bdf
to bdf+pasid.

Thanks for clarification.

ah yes; I got hung-up on different mappings, and didn't back up to AS-container split & same IOMMUFD.

That explanation helps. :)  maybe put a short blurb in the commit log, or code,
so one doesn't have to be a ninja-VTD spec consumer to comprehend those (important) diffs.

Again, thanks for the reply.
Looking fwd to the rfcv3 (on list) or move to v1-POST.
