Identifying a mapping by its address seems pretty natural to me for
callers of the API, at least as long as the address is all that the
caller ever needs. The solution I implemented didn't/doesn't seem
overly complicated to me, and I am hoping it wouldn't overwhelm anyone
else who has worked with container_of (which seems to be used
liberally in qemu). But at the end of the day it's a matter of
personal taste and the background of the person writing the code, so
I'll readily admit that this is personal opinion, and if qemu does
prefer a different style then by all means we should change it and
I'll be happy to help with that.
