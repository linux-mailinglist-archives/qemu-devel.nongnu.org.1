> Stafford: sorry for not being responsive. I've been very busy lately, and it's been several months since I touched anything OpenRISC-related. Are you able to push this the rest of the way through the acceptance process? I had understood that you were looking for a more elaborate overhaul of the OpenRISC timer design which I haven't had time to work on. But if the patch can go forward in its current form, I think the improvement is worth having even it doesn't address other design issues.

Hi Joel,

Yes, I was able to sort out the issues and get everything tested and fixed up.
The patch is now committed upstream in QEMU for the 9.2.0 release.  I also
thought its better to have this upstream in its current form rather than wait
for further improvements.

Thanks for your help.  I look forward to you getting some free cycles and
helping more with OpenRISC when you get any chance.

I was also busy last year until November and didn't have much time to work on
this.

-Stafford
