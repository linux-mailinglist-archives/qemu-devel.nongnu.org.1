What is the benefit of having such explicit layering of different lifecycle
between the owner and the MRs that it owns?

To ask in another way, what's the functional benefit that we order the
destruction of MRs within the same owner, paying that with explicit two
refcounts concept in memory core?

AFAICT, that's the only purpose MR->refcount is servicing for in this
patchset besides the property link.

Currently, memory_region_ref() takes the refcount _only_ from the host.
Considering that's the only memory API to take a reference on a MR, it kind
of implies to everyone that the MR and the owner shares the lifetime.

In reality, it's not 100% shared indeed, but almost.  We even have those
document for dynamic MRs to make sure that is true even there.

Then it's about the "virtual lifecycle" which triggers a finalize(), or
"real lifecycle" which triggers a free() that may make a difference to a
MR.  And that's the part on whether we should try to not expose too much at
all on these.  I want to keep the concept simple if possible that we stick
with sharing lifetime between owner and all MRs underneath.  I want to see
whether we can avoid complicating that part.

I can see why you want to clearly separate the lifetimes, because it's
cleaner to you.  But IMHO we already made a decision from that starting
from when memory_region_ref() does not take MR->refcount, otherwise you
should at least need something like this to make the lifecycle completely
separate in your this patch:

     }
 }

To me, QEMU already went the other way.  So I sincerely don't know how that
extra mr->refcount usage it could bring us.  It only makes it harder to
understand to me.

OK, let's try to figure out a best way to move forward then.

Let me try to summarize the two approaches so far.

So in general I think I don't prefer this patch because this patch is kind
of in the middle of something.

It neither provides 100% separation of MR lifecycle: as discussed above, on
not referencing MR->refcount on memory_region_ref/unref at least yet so far
together in this patch, but suddenly started considering it in MR links.
To me, that's abuse if ordering of such finalize() is not justified.

Nor it provides best efficiency: needing to take a MR->refcount when
linking two MRs, even if we essentially don't need to guarded by the fact
that owner must exist already, which must hold true anyway for QEMU to work
so far.

What I think the best is we either go one way or another: either we make MR
lifecycle clearly separate, or we make it clearly efficient (meanwhile we
still keep the concept easy, and we at least try to always stick with one
refcount which is easier to maintain too).

IMHO that's what the other older patch does (plus my fixup squashed in):

https://lore.kernel.org/all/ZsenKpu1czQGYz7m@x1n/

That avoids taking a refcount for internal MRs, always stick with owner
shares the same lifecycle with MRs, just like the same assumption we have
already had in memory_region_ref().  The bad side effect is we need
something slightly hackish in mr finalize(), but we can provide some better
doc, and keep the comlexity there only (which I think is better than always
having two refcounts all over).

If we worry about removal of that container assertion, we could assert
instead on the owner.  I've attached a slightly modified full version of
such alternative patch below, with the best comment I see suite.
