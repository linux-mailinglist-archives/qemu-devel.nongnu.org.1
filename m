I think the situation here will be the same as with any new flag
affecting the migration wire protocol - if the old version of QEMU
doesn't support that flag then it has to be kept at its backward-compatible
setting for migration to succeed.

The VFIO loading threads are created from vfio_load_setup(), which is
called at the very beginning of the migration, so they should be already
there.

However, they aren't currently prepared to receive VM live phase data.

I'm still trying to figure out the complete explanation why dedicated
device state channels improve downtime as there was a bunch of holidays
last week here.

I will have a look later what would it take to add VM live phase multifd
device state transfer support and also how invasive it would be as I
think it's better to keep the number of code conflicts in a patch set
to a manageable size as it reduces the chance of accidentally
introducing regressions when forward-porting the patch set to the git master.
