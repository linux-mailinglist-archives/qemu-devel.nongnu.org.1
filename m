Being slow doesn't matter, and it is not just for the cursor, but there 
are several other functions modified; I guess the resulting resource 
will be unusable except for accelerations like virgl.

The fact that mmap() is being optional for DMA-BUF and VFIO is 
insufficient, but what matters here is whether a DMA-BUF that lacks 
mmap() is usable for graphics.

Reading the cover letter, I suppose you are importing a mmap-incapable 
DMA-BUF exported by a dGPU, and the imported DMA-BUF is used with virgl 
or something. Explaining the use case will show that there is a 
mmap-incapable DMA-BUF usable for graphics.
