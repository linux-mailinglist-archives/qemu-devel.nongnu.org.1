The raw / nbd deprecations are:

/usr/lib64/python3.9/asyncio/trsock.py:20: DeprecationWarning: Using sendmsg() method on sockets returned from get_extra_info('socket') will be prohibited in asyncio 3.9. Please report your use case to bugs.python.org.
  warnings.warn(
DeprecationWarning: Enable tracemalloc to get the object allocation traceback


This comes from send_fd_scm in qmp_client.py where it does

        sock = self._writer.transport.get_extra_info('socket')

        if sock.family != socket.AF_UNIX:
            raise QMPError("Sending file descriptors requires a UNIX socket.")

        if not hasattr(sock, 'sendmsg'):
            # We need to void the warranty sticker.
            # Access to sendmsg is scheduled for removal in Python 3.11.
            # Find the real backing socket to use it anyway.
            sock = sock._sock  # pylint: disable=protected-access

        sock.sendmsg(
            [b' '],
            [(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SCM_RIGHTS, struct.pack('@i', fd))]
        )


As that comment says, the 'sendmsg' method has been removed
from the TransportSock object returned by 'get_extra_info',
with asyncio offering no replacement. The code above grabs
the private sock._sock handle, which is rather gross, but
we lack better options.

The problem in CI is that I picked CentOS 9 which has py 3.9
which still has the 'sendmsg' method. On newer distros
'sendmsg' is gone, so we grab the private sock._sock and
so dno't see a deprecation message.

IMHO we need to revert this previous change, so we avoid
calling the deprecated method at all:

  commit a57cb3e23d5ac918a69d0aab918470ff0b429ff9
  Author: John Snow <jsnow@redhat.com>
  Date:   Thu Nov 18 15:46:20 2021 -0500

    python/aqmp: fix send_fd_scm for python 3.6.x
    
    3.6 doesn't play keepaway with the socket object, so we don't need to go
    fishing for it on this version. In fact, so long as 'sendmsg' is still
    available, it's probably preferable to just use that method and only go
    fishing for forbidden details when we absolutely have to.

The need for 3.6 compat no longer exists since we bumped
min python, so that justification for that original
commit is now obsolete.


With regards,
Daniel
