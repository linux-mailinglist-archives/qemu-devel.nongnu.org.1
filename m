QEMU uses clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) on Linux hosts. The man page
says:

  All CLOCK_MONOTONIC variants guarantee that the time returned by
  consecutive  calls  will  not go backwards, but successive calls
  may=E2=80=94depending  on  the  architecture=E2=80=94return  identical  (=
not-in=E2=80=90
  creased) time values.

trace_record_start() calls clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) so trace events
should have monotonically increasing timestamps.

I don't see a scenario where trace record A's timestamp is greater than
trace record B's timestamp unless the clock is non-monotonic.

Which host CPU architecture and operating system are you running?

Please attach to the QEMU process with gdb and print out the value of
the use_rt_clock variable or add a printf in init_get_clock(). The value
should be 1.

Stefan
