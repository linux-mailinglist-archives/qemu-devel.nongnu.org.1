I think it's a good idea to have individual error source for each vCPU. In this
way, the read_ack_reg won't be a limitation. I hope Jonathan is ok to this scheme.

Currently, we have two (fixed) error sources like below. I assume the index of
the error source per vCPU will starts from (ACPI_HEST_SRC_ID_QMP + 1) based on
CPUState::cpu_index.

enum AcpiGhesSourceID {
     ACPI_HEST_SRC_ID_SYNC,
     ACPI_HEST_SRC_ID_QMP,       /* Use it only for QMP injected errors */
};

I believe real HW also have this specific issue. As to ARM64, I ever did some
google search and was told the error follows the firmware-first policy and
handled by a component of trustfirmware-a. However, I was unable to get the
source code. So it's hard for me to know how this specific issue is handled
there.

Thanks,
Gavin
