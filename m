The changes I made (or merged) were mostly for the external interfaces
of the device. Initialising the qdev device, setting properties, passing
them to the SCSI device etc. It's been a while since I last looked at
some actual USB stuff (and not in the context of QEMU), so I'm not
necessarily the natural reviewer/maintainer for this part of it. (On the
other hand, who is if Gerd doesn't have the time for it any more?)

I can try to find the time to have a look at the series, but given that
I'll have to familiarise myself with the specs again, it might take a
while.

That makes sense to me. I suppose I can also give a quick review for the
initial part of the msd patches, at lot of which seems to be more or
less just refactoring.
