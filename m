The trick for that is to put the "dma-coherent" property right in the 
root of the DT so it plausibly communicates "the whole platform is 
coherent", and is then inherited by all devices, even those which 
shouldn't technically need it.

The issue there is, per the history Jonathan dug up, DT on Arm got the 
assumption baked into it from day one that "dma-ranges" was implied for 
simple-bus and similar, and thus there is no easy generic way to 
indicate that any MMIO device *can't* do DMA. For Linux this means we 
end up having to assume that everything *might* be DMA-capable, since 
the only thing which knows for sure is a driver, but we have further 
legacy in the driver model which means we have to do perform the basic 
DMA setup for any device *before* its driver probes. Yes, it's a bit 
rubbish; feel free to shake your fist at the past.

(At least we learned and got it right in ACPI for arm64 by making the 
_CCA method mandatory for DMA-capable devices...)

Except it absolutely is, because the whole reason for setting force_dma 
on those buses is that they *do* commonly have DMA-capable devices, and 
they are also commonly non-coherent such that this condition would be 
serious. Especially AMBA, given that the things old enough to still be 
using that abstraction rather than plain platform (PL080, PL111, 
PL330,...) all predate ACE-Lite so don't even have the *possibility* of 
being coherent without external trickery in the interconnect.

Thanks,
Robin.
