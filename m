I'm unsure about [1.]. What do you mean? The series touch only comments.

I now check:

  git diff 37137ae582 HEAD | grep '^[+-][^#+-]'

where 37137ae582 is first commit "qapi: Add documentation format validation"
for me, and this grep finds nothing..

Assume [4.] is a tiny part.

Hmm it surprises me.. Does it mean that the check added in patch 01 misses
some violations?

Compare with original diffstat:

  33 files changed, 713 insertions(+), 704 deletions(-)

So obviously, touching up code examples makes the series twice more invasive.

I agree, to at least postpone examples changing. And the series show, that in many
cases there are no obvious possibility to satisfy restrictions for examples.

Hmm, probably, we want another limit for examples? 90 characters? Anyway, not in this
series.
