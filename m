Hi, Peter

We already spoke on IRC, but so everyone is in the same page:

The analyze-migration.py script is broken for s390x even in
master. That's why* we cannot reproduce this issue in our local
setups. The s390-storage_attributes section is failing to parse the last
STATTR_FLAG_EOS, which is a u64 0x1 that the generic code then reads a
byte from and sees 0x0 =3D=3D QEMU_VM_EOF.

*- yes, this doesn't account for the s390 host that Thomas used
   which didn't reproduce the issue, but still...

The patch is here and I'll include it at the end of the email as well:

https://gitlab.com/farosas/qemu/-/commit/5bcad03aad85556a7b72f79d3574e246a9=

Interesting, I didn't know about that. I'm indeed seeing some stray "48"
('0') now in the stream. I'll give your patch a try.

Here's the fix for the pre-existing issue in the script:

Subject: [PATCH 1/2] migration: Fix parsing of s390 stream

The parsing for the S390StorageAttributes section is currently leaving
an unconsumed token that is later interpreted by the generic code as
QEMU_VM_EOF, cutting the parsing short.

The migration will issue a STATTR_FLAG_DONE between iterations, but
there's a final STATTR_FLAG_EOS at .save_complete.
