The argument as I understand it is that enforcing that the contents
remain unchanged between source and target is a policy, but QEMU has
no basis to create such a policy because the ABI for this capability is
not defined by the spec.  Furthermore since the ABI of this capability
is only defined by the device, only the driver for the device should
have any interaction with the capability.

There's some merit there, but a potential flaw is that QEMU does in
fact register several vendor specific capabilities for which it does
know the ABI.  See for example:

	vfio_add_vmd_shadow_cap()
	vfio_add_nv_gpudirect_cap()
	pci_bridge_qemu_reserve_cap_init()
	virtio_pci_add_mem_cap()

I think only the vfio VMD one can be claimed not to support migration
since afaik we could add a GPUDirect clique capability to a migratable
vGPU.  So since these are QEMU created capabilities and QEMU does
understand the ABI, what about these specific capabilities would allow
them to change between source and target VMs?

The GPUDirect clique capability describes p2p capabilities between
devices.  That information cannot spontaneously change.

The bridge vendor capability exposes reserved bridge resources, which I
think is consumed by firmware so a change would result in resources
shifting after migration and a guest reboot.  That would be bad.

The virtio vendor capability does a variety of things that I'm sure MST
could explain better than me, but also seems like defined ABI to the VM.

So actually is it the case that the only vendor specific capabilities
exposed to the VM that QEMU doesn't understand are those provided from
a device exposed through vfio-pci?  If that's the case, then QEMU's
default policy to verify that the vendor capability is unchanged seems
to be valid and I'd think the patch instead should be creating
exceptions to that default policy for vfio-pci devices (ie. nothing
says vfio-pci cannot clear cmask bits set by the pci-core).

I think we also see above that there are vendor specific capabilities
that have a scope beyond the guest driver itself, some visible through
userspace tools, some consumed by firmware.  So I still find it
difficult to determine whether any vfio-pci exception should be
unconditional or tied to specific devices.

Also, migration is only supported by vfio-pci variant drivers, so why
is it that the variant driver cannot or should not make the target
capability match the source?  If the contents of the capability
changes, does it need to be exposed at all by the variant driver, or is
the vendor specific capability the only means to expose this
information for the driver?  Thanks,

Alex
