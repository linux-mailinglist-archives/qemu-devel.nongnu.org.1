Yeah, this does introduce some complexity of the "whose error is this?"
kind. I can imagine future users of migrate_has_error() having to handle
the error differently whether it came from this machine or the remote
one. Maybe with current code there's no issue, but we need to think from
a design perspective. Another point is whether the source machine is
always prepared to see an error that has nothing to do with its own
operation as it usually gets to know about a destination error only when
TCP connections start to fail.

That said, from a usability perspective, I'm in favor of having the
source machine be able to inform the user about the destination
machine's error. It goes in the direction of relying less on the
management layer, which we already agree might be a good idea.
