Usually the point of such non-standard configs would be running Linux via 
-kernel which could use whatever is configured if it has a way to detect 
it or maybe for memory it could even be specified on the kernel command 
line. But maybe this is not a common enough config to support so reporting 
error for memory size that's not on the list of valid sizes might be 
enough. This is similar to qemu-system-ppc -machine sam460ex which has a 
memory controller register that can only describe existing DIMM sizes. 
Originally I allowed users to specify whatever memory size and only warn 
for sizes not matching a DIMM size because Linux only looks at the device 
tree which QEMU can generate when booting with -kernel so it works but the 
firmware detects RAM from the SPD data and can only support certain sizes 
so only less RAM that could be convered with SPD data would be visible for 
guests. But then others thought it's better to return error for such cases 
and changed it and removed the support for arbitrary memory size so now it 
returns error when non power of 2 memory size is specified.
