Don't worry about it!  From my point of view, the process worked okay.
A big series got reviewed by maintainers, except for one little patch
touching another subsystem, where that subsystem's maintainer (me)
remained silent.  The series was then merged without further delay.

Would I have appreciate a timely nudge on that little patch?  Sure.  Is
not nudging me a failure of sorts?  Nope.
