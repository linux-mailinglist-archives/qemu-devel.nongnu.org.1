I still don't see the point.  Either the cluster was already non-zero
before the failed write-zero (so there's no bit to pre-clear); or the
cluster was already zero before the failed write-zero, and any failure
that corrupts the disk by actually turning zeroes into non-zero is not
worth worrying about, so pre-clearing the bit is not going to make
things any better.
