  Hi,

That used to be a problem with UEFI too.

Sounds like the phys-bits of your vcpus is larger than the value the
host actually supports.  So if the firmware tries to use the whole
address space available things break.

Both UEFI and SeaBIOS have a similar heuristic to figure whenever they
can trust phys-bits or not, and those checks consider upstream qemu
behavior (use phys-bits=40 for all cpu types except 'host').

When this came up with UEFI the root cause turned out to be that suse
qemu derived from upstream qemu.  There have been phys-bits values other
than 40 which where not valid (i.e. larger than supported by the host).

I don't know how that was solved in the end.  But given that we see
similar problems again with SeaBIOS I suspect it was patched in suse
OVMF not suse qemu.

I'd actually recommend to run all VMs with host-phys-bits=on (and use
host-phys-bits-limit=value if you need phys-bits being equal on all
machines of a heterogeneous cluster for live migration compatibility).

phys-bits being too big never was a valid configuration.  It only
happened to work because the firmware was very conservative with address
space usage.  That strategy became increasingly problematic though.
These days GPUs and NPUs can have gigabytes of device memory and equally
large pci memory bars ...

take care,
  Gerd
