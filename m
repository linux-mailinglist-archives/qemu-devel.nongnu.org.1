I don't understand why you insist in bringing slow/quick into this. '-m
quick' is for quick tests and '-m slow' is for slow tests. What we're
doing here is: "small set" vs. "large set". Except for our own sanity
we're excluding slow tests from the "small set", otherwise the
perception of smallness is counteracted by the perception of slowness.

Then, we're determining arbitrarily that the small set is to be run only
on TCG hosts and the large set is to be run in the KVM hosts. And via
cmdline we want to be able to run anything basically.

I was thinking more of make check in peoples machines. Who knows what
sort of setups QEMU developers have... As for CI, I don't think it
should change and as I said, if it does then the test itself should be
able to cope.

We shouldn't change stuff that's also used by the rest of the
community. People know about QEMU_TEST_FLAKY_TESTS and -m slow. These
must continue to work the same.

We can say: "Internally we don't allow slow and flaky to be in the smoke
set".

We cannot say: "In migration-test QEMU_TEST_FLAKY_TESTS is actually
QEMU_MIG_TEST_FLAKY, -m slow is actually QEMU_MIG_TEST_EXTRA, -m slow
just implies KVM and -m quick implies TCG. Easy peasy!"

Don't see this^ as a matrix of --full and -m. This is identical to what
we have today, with the addition of a flag that determines the amount of
tests run. We could call it other names if we want:

--size small/large
--testset smoke/full

Yes, but we have the words "migration-test" in the CI .yaml *today*. It
doesn't matter if it invokes the tests from the last release. If we
changed the name to "migration-foobar", then the CI job continues to
work up until 10.0 is released. It then breaks immediately in the first
commit of 10.0.50 because the previous release will now have the
"migration-foobar" name while the CI still calls for "migration-test".

Basically the point is that CI .yaml changes take effect immediately
while test cmdline changes only take effect (in CI) on the next release.

It's annoying, that's all. Makes me 1% more grumpy.
