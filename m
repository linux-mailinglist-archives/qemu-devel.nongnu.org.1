I'd really like if simple devices could be implemented without further 
complication. I don't mind if the method is called init or realize and 
when it's called but most devices should only need one of them and not 
have to care about where each step in their init phase should go when most 
of the time they are just created once and never finalized like this one. 
For these classes having two init methods just distracts from the actual 
functionality of the class and makes it more difficult to write them and 
understand what they do. The way that a lot of classes follow currently 
that they only have realize and only need init if some properties or child 
objects providing properties need to be created before realize to be 
possible to set them is easy to understand and keeps devices simple. So is 
there an advantage for hot-pluggable devices are not deinit when they are 
unplugged or is it a big performance issue to rerun realize on re-plug? 
Given that such classes are not common I'd trade that for keeping most 
other classes simple and more easily understandable and only require 
multiple methods where really needed.
