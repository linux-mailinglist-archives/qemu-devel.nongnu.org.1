We shouldn't migrate a 'host' CPU model anywhere other than to an exactly
identical host (same ID registers, same errata). Also, migration must
consider the host kernel. The aim is to support "ping-pong" migration,
i.e. migrate A->B->A, where B has a host kernel which is the same or more
recent than A. This is a reasonable level of support, as it supports host
upgrades with rollback. B cannot be older than A, as it may not handle
errata in the same way.

And higher layers yet, libvirt daemons capture all the information of the
hosts they run on. Layers above libvirt compare information from all hosts
under their control to create sets of possible migration destinations for
each VM, considering the VM configurations.

We can't support arbitrary vendor CPU models on arbitrary hosts. I'm only
advocating for supporting CPU model XYZ when KVM is running on XYZ CPUs
or compatible CPUs (more on the compatible CPUs later).

To elaborate, I don't really see a problem with expecting KVM to provide a
VCPU which matches the CPU model of the physical CPU which KVM is running
on (minus M-mode). KVM should be steadily learning how to expose all
extensions of the CPUs it runs on to its guests. So, while it may not be
possible now to enable all extensions of a particular model, it should be
eventually. If there are extensions in the CPU model which cannot be
virtualized, then it may be tolerable for QEMU to just warn about them,
rather than abort the whole thing (hopefully we don't have any of those
anyway). And, the "VCPU only almost matching the CPU model" problem isn't
much different than the "VCPU not actually matching the host CPU when
using '-cpu host'" problem. In both cases, a user may not be pleased that
they didn't get exactly what they asked for. At least with the CPU model,
QEMU will be aware of the differences and can warn about them.

We should definitely check the ID registers. If KVM says it's running on
XYZ CPUs, then we should consider allowing the XYZ model to be used with
KVM guests. If the host is emulated and the user configured things in
a strange way, then, when things blow up, they can keep the pieces.

(And now back to compatible CPUs.)

The user may not want the most capable VCPU. The user may want the most
compatible for their datacenter. If the datacenter is a bunch of XYZ
revision 1 CPUs which are slowly getting replaced with XYZ revision 2
CPUs, and revision 2 is compatible with revision 1, then it should be
safe to use the XYZ revision 1 CPU model for KVM VCPUs. Using '-cpu host'
would require that the guests only migrate to other hosts of the exact
same type (either revision 1 or revision 2, depending on where they were
launched first).

If KVM and QEMU decide a CPU model is compatible with the host they're
running on, then the model will be allowed. If not, then the model will
error out. Documentation about what is possible and not for RISC-V KVM
CPU models is the best we can do to educate users.

Whether 'host' is the better choice or not depends on the use case. Being
able to migrate a less capable VM to similar hardware in a datacenter
could be a higher priority than extension support. The admins deploying
VMs will need to collect the requirements from their users and make those
choices. We should try to provide support for both.

There could be an argument made that the set of compatible CPUs is too
small to bother with supporting CPU models at all. (That's basically the
argument we have in the Arm KVM world where only '-cpu host' is
supported since errata mitigations are installed based on ID registers.)
I'm a bit more optimistic with RISC-V, because the base of the RISC-V
instruction set is small and I hope vendors will conform to the specs for
it (there are already examples to the contrary, but let's stay optimistic
a bit longer :-). So, if we assume the size and spec compliance of the
base keeps errata out of the base, then the errata will only be in
extensions. This means that the mitigations, which will still use ID
registers to install, would only apply to extensions. Then, it's easy to
avoid those mitigations by simply disabling the affected extensions
altogether.

Now, one might state, if we're disabling extensions to avoid errata, then
we're no longer properly providing the model. That statement is correct,
which is why we also need to provide a bare minimal base CPU model where
each extension that should be enabled is explicitly enabled on the QEMU
command line. This base CPU model would use zero for the ID registers,
which is a legal value and indicates that the CPU "is a non-commercial
implementation". Actually, I could be convinced to not support XYZ VCPUs
on XYZ CPU hosts at all, as long as we have this base CPU model working
with KVM, since the base CPU model can satisfy those that prioritize
migration over capabilities even better than CPU models can.

Works for me.
