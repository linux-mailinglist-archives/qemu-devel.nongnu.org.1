Good, automated tests will continue to be protected by tests after it is
merged.

QEMU's qtest framework (tests/qtest/) launches QEMU in the special qtest
mode where the guest does not execute CPU instructions. The test case
can send commands like reading and writing guest RAM and hardware
registers so it can remote-control QEMU as if it were a running guest.
https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/devel/testing/qtest.html

qtest is low-level but there are VIRTIO qtest APIs that offer something
similar to a VIRTIO driver API. You could extend that API to support
VIRTIO Shared Memory Regions over virtio-pci
(tests/qtest/libqos/virtio-pci.c).

A vhost-user device is also required. You could implement a dummy device
with libvhost-user that has a few VIRTIO Shared Memory Regions and
nothing else (no virtqueues, etc). The dummy device would create a
shared memory file descriptor and send the SHMEM_MAP message.

Then a qtest test case can be written that launches the dummy vhost-user
device and QEMU with --device vhost-user-device. Using the qtest VIRTIO
API you can initialize the device, enumerate VIRTIO Shared Memory
Regions (using the new qtest API you added), and test that
loading/storing to the VIRTIO Shared Memory Region works.

It would also be possible to test more advanced cases like 256 VIRTIO
Shared Memory Regions, skipping regions with 0 size, MAP/UNMAP sequences
including rejecting partial UNMAP and overlapping MAP, etc.
