Logically, maybe we don't need to forbid migrate_incoming to only work with
a clean QEMU, because internally it's the same to snapshot load.  We'll
need some special care on zero pages but I don't see a major blocker yet.

Said that, IMHO for your use case I still wonder if the shmem idea would
still be worth exploring, or if you have explored but maybe found some high
overhead on booting QEMU every time?  That's what I mentioned here:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/aB4rhlVGCSk7IwoE@x1.local/

I wished that would work out already, or maybe you've tried it and it was
too slow for you.

Your use case is indeed special, if the dirtied pages are normally not
much, the most efficient way to do this is only record the pages changed
from the snapshot and rollback only those pages, plus all device states.

That's not a traditional "snapshot" concept, more like a "checkpoint" and
"restore", where now in migration we have CPR taking that term already..

  https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/devel/migration/CPR.html

But your case is slightly different from functionality, so that it will
happen completely within a single QEMU instance.

So far, it sounds like a new QMP function v.s. snapshot save/load or
"migrate" / "migrate_incoming" to me, because it shouldn't need to record a
VM image, but VM diff (for rollback only).  The bitmap you need here will
also be attached to the VM diff (again, not VM image, because a rollback
doesn't require a full image).

Not sure if that's what you want, though.  Anyway, IMHO anything like that
need to be justified first with above shmem idea not performing as well in
the first place.

I'm not sure how this will work out yet.. if there'll be a student working
on it I'll make sure anything to be posted to have you in the loop.

Also, if it will work out, I'd expect we'll set the goal for the student to
start with the very simple, e.g. no multifd support and maybe starting with
one type of mem (anonymous?), we'll see.  There might be gaps to what may
start to help in your use case too.

Anyway, feel free to jump in anytime to share your thoughts.

Thanks,
