Not saved for later: a massive improvement of the generated
documentation's looks and usability.  Moreover, I hope the new generator
will be easier to maintain than the old one, because its inner workings
are closer to how Sphinx expects such things to work.  Fair?

Not a blocker as far as I'm concerned, because I feel you're unlikely to
run away from this :)

Likewise.

I'll have a look, and then we'll talk.

I'll try to find some, but I'm not overly optimistic ;)

*clap* clap* clap*

This is waaaay harder than it has any right to be.

scripts/qapi/ remains clean for me.  docs/sphinx/ improves from no type
checking to type checking with a version newer than the one I have on my
development box right now, which I count as an improvement.

We owe you an entire layer cake, with a marzipan figurine of your
conquering self on top.  Seriously, I could not have done this.
