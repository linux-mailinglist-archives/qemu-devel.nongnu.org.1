Hmm, I haven't noticed that (only looked at the diff between working and 
non-working and saw it moved) but according to e.g. 
https://www.stanislavs.org/helppc/ports.html The original parallel 
interface had less ports so there was no overlap, maybe it's because we 
emulate EPP+ECP or other advanced features that the message from the Linux 
list mentions as not working at the default address on real machine 
either. So we may need to disable additional ports which probably do not 
exist on real machine unless enabled (which the firmware does not seem to 
do) or maybe changing priority as you say could help. Anybody wants to 
come up with a patch? I don't have time now and may forget later.
