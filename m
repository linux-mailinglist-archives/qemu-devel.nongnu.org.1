The diff would be easier to read if you could keep the order...  You
don't due to the subtle change of the state predicates.  More on that
below.

We .check() entities on after the other.  *Except*
QAPISchemaObjectType.check() "calls another type T's .check() exactly
when the C struct emitted by gen_object() contains that T's C struct".
If the recursion loops, the schema asks for C structs containing
themselves.  To catch this, we have QAPISchemaType objects go through
three states:

1. Not yet checked.

2. Being checked; object.check() is on the call stack.

3. Checked, i.e. object.check() completed.

How to recognize the states before the patch:

1. not ._checked and .members is None

2. ._checked and .members is None

3. ._checked and .members is not None

   Since .members is not None implies .checked, we simply use
   .members is not None.

We go from state 1. to 2. in super().check().

We go from state 2. to 3. at # mark completed.

Note that .checked becomes true well before we finish checking.  This is
admittedly confusing.  If you can think of a less confusing name, ...

The patch's aim is to avoid use of .members, to enable the next patch.

I don't doubt that your solution works, but trying to understand how it
works makes my tired brain go owww!

State invariants (I think):

1. not ._checked and .members is None and not ._checking

2. ._checked and .members is None and ._checking

3. ._checked and .members is not None and not ._checking

We can then recognize states without use of .members:

1. not ._checked and not ._checking

   Since not ._checked implies not .checking, we can simply use
   not ._checked.

2. ._checked and ._checking

   A deliciously confusing predicate, isn't it?

3. ._checked and not ._checking

Deep breath...  alright, here's the stupidest replacement for use of
.members that could possibly work: add a flag, ensure it's True exactly
when .members is not None.  Like this:
