I think this case threw me off because From<Arc<W: Wake>> is a bit
more generic than your
usual From implementation.  Maybe it's obvious to anyone who has used
futures in Rust
(I haven't).

I agree, something like

    let waker =3D Waker::from(waker);
    let mut cx =3D Context::from_waker(&waker);

could be the best of both worlds.

The idea was that you don't call the correct function but the *only*
function :) i.e. exec.run_until(), and it will do the right thing for
coroutine vs. no coroutine.

But yeah, there would be boilerplate to pass it all the way down so
maybe it is not a great idea. I liked the concept that you just
*couldn't* get _co_ wrong... but perhaps it is not necessary once more
of "BlockDriver::open"
is lifted into bdrv_open<D: BlockDriver>.
