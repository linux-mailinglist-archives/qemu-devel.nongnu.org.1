the point of moving handle packing to aml-build.c,
is to isolate primitives that likely could be reused later on elsewhere
and hide little endiannes from API user.
So shuch errors as you are fixing wouldn't be easy to introduce
(as long as API does it right)


Also this API probably should take not packed BDF, i.e. something like this:
    build_append_srat_pci_device_handle(GArray *table_data, bus, dev, func)

Or a packed BDF as you suggest in the later email, but then API function wold have
to 'decode' that before putting numbers into table, which complicates things
and likely would pull in PCI deps to unpack BDF, which I'd rather avoid in
generic aml-build.c
