Thank you for the encouraging and very constructive feedback.


Your proposed solution—to define the security attribute as a property on 
the PCIDevice—is the perfect way forward to resolve Secure device issue. 
Perhaps we can implement this functionality in V4 as shown in the 
following code snippet?

1)  define sec_sid in include/hw/pci/pci_device.h:

struct PCIDevice {
     DeviceState qdev;
......
     /* Add SEC_SID property for SMMU security context */
     uint8_t sec_sid;  /* 0 = Non-secure, 1 = Secure*/
......

}


2) then add sec-sid field in the Property of PCI in hw/pci/pci.c:

static const Property pci_props[] = {
......
     /* SEC_SID property: 0=NS, 1=S */
     DEFINE_PROP_UINT8("sec-sid", PCIDevice, sec_sid, 0),

......

};


3) get sec-sid in smmu_find_add_as(hw/arm/smmu-common.c):

static AddressSpace *smmu_find_add_as(PCIBus *bus, void *opaque, int devfn)
{
     SMMUState *s = opaque;
     SMMUPciBus *sbus = g_hash_table_lookup(s->smmu_pcibus_by_busptr, bus);
     SMMUDevice *sdev;
     static unsigned int index;
     ......
     sdev = sbus->pbdev[devfn];
     if (!sdev) {

         PCIDevice *pcidev;
         pcidev = pci_find_device(bus, pci_bus_num(bus), devfn);
         if (pcidev) {
             /* Get sec_sid which is originally from QEMU options.
              * For example:
              * qemu-system-aarch64 \
              * -drive if=none,file=/nvme.img,format=raw,id=nvme0 \
              * -device nvme,drive=nvme0,serial=deadbeef,sec-sid=1
              *
              * This NVMe device will have sec_sid = 1.
             */
             sdev->sec_sid = pcidev->sec_sid;
         } else {
             /* Default to Non-secure if device not found */
             sdev->sec_sid = 0;
         }

......

}

The SEC_SID of device will be passed from QEMU options to PCIDevice and 
then SMMUDevice. This would allow the SMMU model to perform the 
necessary checks against both the security context of the DMA access and 
the SMMU_S_IDR1.SECURE_IMPL capability bit.


Is this a reasonable implementation approach? I would greatly appreciate 
any feedback.

I just use IGB NIC for test with Hafnium + OP-TEE software stack.

Thank you also for sharing the invaluable context from your team's 
internal discussions and your outreach to the Arm experts. This 
clarification directly inspired my new proposal as described above.


I will proceed with this plan for the v4 patch set. Thanks again for 
your mentorship and for helping to clarify the correct path forward.

Best regards,

Tao
