Supporting such a wide range of versions is *expensive*.

Writing compat.py is sunk cost.

Maintaining it is not.  It's fragile hacks, hard to understand even with
deep Sphinx innards expertise, impossible to understand without.  I
figure if we somehow lost your expertise, we'd likely have to drop
support for old Sphinx the moment compat.py breaks.

Just because we can solve certain hard problems doesn't mean we should.
I question the wisdom of supporting such a wide range of Sphinx
versions.
