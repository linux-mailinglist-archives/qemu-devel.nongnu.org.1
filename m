Thanks. Let me know how/if I can help.

Just a guess, but given the alignment change, I suspect it's barfing on 
the statically linked initramfs? That seems the most likely step to go 
off the rails given the failing patch is a symbol alignment change in 
the flattened device tree plumbing, and I think the initramfs extractor 
parses device trees very early on to find stuff (I forget why). Moving 
"where the data lives" without a corresponding change to the "where to 
look for the data" code seems a bit strange, but it's not my area...

Here's the miniconfig I built 6.12 with (90% of which is generic to all 
the architectures I'm testing, the sections are labeled. The 
console="FIXME" bit is because I can't get qemu-system-or1k -append 
"blah" to go through to linux, so I stuck FIXME in that field for the 
or1k target and it wound up in the output):

# make ARCH=openrisc allnoconfig KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG=linux-miniconfig

And then run-qemu.sh is just:

DIR="$(dirname $0)"; qemu-system-or1k -M or1k-sim -m 256 "$@" -nographic 
-no-reboot -kernel "$DIR"/linux-kernel -append "HOST=or1k console=FIXME 
$KARGS"
echo -e '\e[?7h'

(The echo is because some qemu bioses disable wordwrap in the terminal 
and leave it broken, driving bash cursor-up history nuts. My plumbing 
just sticks a reset in all the architectures' scripts...)

The or1k support in mkroot is the 4 lines at:

   https://github.com/landley/toybox/blob/master/mkroot/mkroot.sh#L256

(I'd cut and paste them here but thunderbird wordwraps everything.)

Also, looking at that, I'm using a builtin DTB and you might be passing 
one in via -dtb? Another thing the alignment change might break...

I've never managed to get console= to go through to linux in 
qemu-system-or1k. The above tries but is ignored.

It's also doing a statically linked initramfs because -initrd didn't 
work on this target. Happy to update if it's been fixed, the other 
targets are almost all using -initrd to feed in an external cpio.gz

The commit in question is not changing UART configuration. It's changing 
the alignment of a symbol. Your patch to the UART plumbing did not fix 
it. I don't see how the UART configuration could have changed between 
the "working" and "not working" states.

Yeah, Python 3's forced upgrade treadmill is deeply silly. I'm not a 
fan: https://landley.net/notes-2024.html#09-04-2024

(I know they're doing it to make sure they never have another "our 
userbase refuses to move off 2.0 for a full decade" moment by holding 
tightly to the control they wrested away from their users and never 
giving an inch back now they've forced the issue, by making sure their 
code spoils like milk and the installed base is regularly slashed and 
burned, but for me that just means "use lua" or something. Yes your dev 
team had trauma. So did the perl guys, who eventually gave UP forcing 
their transition down an unwilling userbase's throat... But again, not 
my area.)
