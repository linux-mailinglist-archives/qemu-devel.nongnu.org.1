Yep, acquiring the refcount immediately before thread-create
is what I meant.

Ok, so with the other series applied, this does look safe, but
it also doesn't seem to really have any dependancy on the
single interface code.  Patch 7 here looks sufficient, in combo
with the other 2 series to avoid the use-after-free flaws.

Agree, and from a practical POV, I think it would be impossible to
require a ref count be held from other non-migration threads, so the
locking around 'current_migration' looks like the only practical
option.
