This case is not supposed to happen because virtio_scsi_hotplug()
immediately places the BB into the virtio-scsi device's AioContext by
calling blk_set_aio_context().

The AioContext invariant is checked at several points in the SCSI
request lifecycle by this function:

  static inline void virtio_scsi_ctx_check(VirtIOSCSI *s, SCSIDevice *d)
  {  =20
      if (s->dataplane_started && d && blk_is_available(d->conf.blk)) {
          assert(blk_get_aio_context(d->conf.blk) =3D=3D s->ctx);
      }=20
  }

Did you find a scenario where the virtio-scsi AioContext is different
=66rom the scsi-hd BB's Aiocontext?
