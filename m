How easy would it be to expose a Rust API? I'm curious because now we
are looking to integrate Rust into QEMU we could consider transitioning
to a Rust API for plugins. It has been done before:

  https://github.com/novafacing/qemu-rs/tree/main/qemu-plugin-sys

and

  https://github.com/novafacing/qemu-rs/tree/main/qemu-plugin

I'm curious as to what it would look like. I don't know how tenable it
would be to run 2 plugin APIs side-by-side long term though. We would
probably want to make a choice. Also how would that affect other C like
APIs like python?
