I don't understand what you mean here. We read the kernel's ICC_CTLR_EL1
at VM startup, when we know it will be the reset value, because we haven't
run any VCPUs yet.

No, we should read the value at realize time, as this patch does.
Trying to do it at cpu_reset runs into the same problem that we
have now that the kernel doesn't expect us to be reading the
register when another vcpu might be running.

We should not need to run pause_vcpus_all() at all here. CPU reset
should be fine done for one vcpu with the others running.

ITS reset should only happen (a) at start of the run, before any
vcpus run or (b) as part of a full system reset. We should check that
the vcpus are paused when we're doing system reset, but I would expect
that to be the case because it would be likely to be buggy if not.
