...except for the failures introduced by modules not being installed,
then all bets are off for all types unless you happen to recall
which have been modularized so far.

Yeah, I'm not a fan of having the separate module_object_class_by_name,
because it requires us to remember whether something has been modularized
or not.

Yes, I think what I meant to write here, was "...except for where
we forgot todo this in *callers* of qdev_new that take user input"

Yep, I don't have confidence in an API that will assert if the caller
forgot to validate the pre-conditions that can be triggered by user
input (or potentially other unexpected scenarios like something being
switched over to a module).

Yes, 2a is fairly rare, but this is amplified by the consequences
of getting it wrong, which are an assert killing your running VM.
My goal was to make it much harder to screw up and trigger an
assert, even if that makes some valid uses more verbose.

Hmm, yes, I hadn't considered the 2nd problem. That's more
unpleasant, as libvirt may well have queried QEMU earlier to
detect the missing module, and assume all is safe if it is
present.

Agreed.

I'm doubtful about a design where maintainers have to choose the
right API, based on mental knowledge of what is a module or not.
The place where object_new is called is typically distinct from
the module impl, so the knowledge is separated. This opens the
door to forgetting to change code from object_new to module_object_new.
This is what motivated my attempt to try to force compile time errors
scenarios which had a high chance of being user specified types.

I don't have a good answer for how to extend compile time validation
to cover non-user specified types that might be modules, without
changnig 'object_new' itself to add "Error **errp" and convert as
many callers as possible to propagate errors. That's a huge pile
of tedious work and in many cases would deteriorate  to &error_abort
since some key common use scenarios lack a "Error *errp" to propagate
into.
