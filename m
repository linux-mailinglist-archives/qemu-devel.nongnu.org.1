>    const and no longer carries an end-of-list marker.
>  * The indentation fix (previously 5/6) has already been merged, so is no
>    longer included.
>  * Added patch fixing up logging of certain unhandled MMIO cases. (4/6)
>  * 6/6: Moved the compat global property table into vmapple patch set -v16;
>    we now just add the conditional-intr-mapping property to it in this
>    patch. We also set the property on any device implementing the abstract
>    TYPE_XHCI_PCI rather than only the TYPE_QEMU_XHCI device specifically.

> v16 -> v17
> 
>  * Rebased on latest upstream (with minor conflict fixes)
>  * apple-gfx, GPEX, and ui/cocoa patches dropped as they have been merged.
>  * Unmerged patches from xhci series v3 combined into this series.
>  * vmapple machine type: Explicitly depend on software GICv3.
>  * vmapple machine type: Enable the new XHCI PCI conditional-intr-mapping
>    property via the machine type's global compat property table.
>  * Integrated Philippe's patch on renaming the GICv3's confusing config name,
>    and removing its TCG dependency. (It's needed with HVF too.)
>  * vmapple machine type: Dropped Tested-by tag because of above changes
