Given the discussions at LPC around how to present GPU/HBM memory and
suggestions that reserved might be a better choice. I wonder if this
patch should provide that option as well?  Or maybe as a potential follow
up. The fun their is that you also need to arrange for DSDT entries to
tie the region to the driver that actually wants it.

Anyhow that session reminded me of what SPM was designed for
(you don't want to know how long it took to come up with the name)
and it is a little more subtle than the description in here suggests.

The x86 specific code looks fine to me but I'm more or less totally
unfamiliar with that, so need review from others.

+CC a few folk from that discussion. I wasn't there in person and
it sounded like the discussion moved to the hallway so it may
have come to a totally different conclusion!

https://lpc.events/event/19/contributions/2064/ has links to slides
and youtube video.

As below. This needs to say something about letting the guest know
that it might want to let a driver manage it separately from normal
system RAM.

This wants tweaking.  As came up at the LPC discussion, SPM is for
memory that 'might' be used as general purpose memory if the policy of the
guest is to do so - as Alistair pointed out at LPC, people don't actually
do that very often, but none the less that's why this type exists. It is
a strong hint to the guest that it needs to apply a policy choice to
what happens to this memory.

Reserved is for memory that is only suitable for use other than generic
memory.
