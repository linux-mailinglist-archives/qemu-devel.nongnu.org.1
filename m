I tend to disagree on that. IMHO, it's better to reduce number of API 
entries instead of callback types.
It's easy for a user to understand how to implement a given callback, 
while it's hard to understand which API you need for which thing.

For the syscall cbs, we already have a specific callback. So why not here?

I tend to see init/exit/resume events as different because you can't get 
useful information attached, except the cpu id. But for control flow 
related stuff, you can be interested in having more.

I understand you're focused on those "events" for now, but while digging 
into this, it seems like the initial need was to track the control flow. 
So I would like to push more in this direction, and offer a more 
extendable solution. Do you think the end goal for a plugin using this 
information may be different? (beyond a plugin counting 
trap/interrupts/semihosting event).

It's ok for the user. But I think it's more complicated to extend, when 
we'll want to introduce control flow API in the future. Do we want 5 or 
6 different callbacks when people want to track fully control flow from 
a plugin?

I didn't want to open the per architecture pandora box :).
I don't think the plugin API itself should deal with per architecture
details like meaning of a given id. I was just thinking to push this 
"raw" information to the plugin, that may/may not use architecture 
specific knowledge to do its work. We already have plugins that have 
similar per architecture knowledge (contrib/plugins/howvec.c) and it's 
ok in some specific cases.

But having something like from/to address seems useful to start. Even if 
we don't provide it for all events yet, it's ok.

We can have one "builder" function per data type, with fixed parameters 
(no varargs), it's reasonable and would scale well with new entries/data 
information.
