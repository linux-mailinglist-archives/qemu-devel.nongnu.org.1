Yes, I have sent the patchset of multifd support for rdma migration by taking over my colleague, and also
sorry for not keeping on this work at that time due to some reasons.
And also I am strongly agree with Lei that the RDMA protocol has some special advantages against with TCP
in some scenario, and we are indeed to use it in our product.

That's a good news to see the socket abstraction for RDMA!
When I was developed the series above, the most pain is the RDMA migration has no QIOChannel abstraction and i need to take a 'fake channel'
for it which is awkward in code implementation.
So, as far as I know, we can do this by
i. the first thing is that we need to evaluate the rsocket is good enough to satisfy our QIOChannel fundamental abstraction
ii. if it works right, then we will continue to see if it can give us opportunity to hide the detail of rdma protocol
    into rsocket by remove most of code in rdma.c and also some hack in migration main process.
iii. implement the advanced features like multi-fd and multi-uri for rdma migration.

Since I am not familiar with rsocket, I need some times to look at it and do some quick verify with rdma migration based on rsocket.
But, yes, I am willing to involved in this refactor work and to see if we can make this migration feature more better:）
