Daniel P. Berrangé also submitted a few comments: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5].
In fact, it is him who first suggested not having a new channel header
wire format or dedicated device state channels.

In addition to that, Avihai was also following our discussions: [6] and
he also looked privately at an early (but functioning) draft of these
patches well before the RFC was even publicly posted.

That "RFC" marking on v0 was meant to signify it as a draft not suitable
to be merged immediately.
Much like marking a {pull,merge} request a draft on Git{Hub,Lab}.

docs/devel/submitting-a-patch.rst even says that:

So what then is necessary to reach a "complete agreement on the whole design"?

Do you think organizing a brainstorming session somewhere (Zoom, etc.) would
help with that?

Although there is always a risk that such "10,000 foot" design turns out
to have significantly worse performance than this one - how a (sensible)
design will perform in real world testing is rather hard to predict in
advance.

The current design took a while to make sure we don't leave any possible
performance (downtime improvement) by mistake.

I agree that anything proposed needs to be well tested before being
submitted.

If someone is migrating data to an older QEMU version that does not
contain this patch set the source must have "x-migration-multifd-transfer"
VFIO device property set to false (the default value) for wire format
compatibility.

The same will go for VM live phase data - it will need to have some
additional setting which needs to be disabled for the wire format
to be compatible with older QEMU versions that do not understand the
such data transfer over multifd channels.

On the other hand, as I wrote in the cover letter, there's nothing
stopping a QEMU device driver from requiring different handling
(loading, etc.) of VM live phase data from the post-switchover data.

So loading such VM live phase data will need a new handler anyway.

I appreciate your work and review Peter - it would be nice if we could
at least make some progress on this subject for 9.1.
