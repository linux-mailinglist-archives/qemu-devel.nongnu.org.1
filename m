Hmm. So
- request a new PCI id (probably in the PCI_DEVICE_ID_REDHAT_* space)
- restructure to have two devices base off the same core functionality
- teach guest operating systems about the new device
- teach management software like libvirt about the new device

Not sure how fast we can get an ID (or even how to go about it.) The
second step should be reasonably easy. The third step is the most
complex one, but at least teaching Linux should hopefully be easy
enough, and existing guest operating systems could continue to use the
existing device. The last step is probably not that bad.

I can start down that path, if we have some consensus that this is the
right way to handle this.

I'd still argue that patch 1 should be applied regardless :)
