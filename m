I'd be interested in Coner's thoughts on this.

My understanding is bindings strive to specify the hardware
independent of the machine it's part of. We have bindings in the
kernel tree, and associated drivers that use those bindings, that work
fine on different machines. The litex peripherals are an extreme case
of this; peripherals defined in python that are attached to soft cores
often running on a FPGA.

At a practical level generating the device tree for a given device
does need to take into account specifics of the machine.

Things like interrupt properties depend on the interrupt device you're
delivering to (some have two cells to provide a 'flags' parameter
alongside the irq number). In general anything that contains phandles
could end up being machine specific. Another case is the number of
cells in reg properties, which depend on the bus the device is
described to be on.

These are things that some common code would need to handle, not show
stoppers for the idea.

Agreed! It was just something to keep in mind when deciding what
pointers to pass around.
