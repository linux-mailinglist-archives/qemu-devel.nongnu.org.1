It wasn't anything as precise as that. It is literally just "1MB" looks
large enough that we don't need to spend time to investigate per arch
page sizes.

Having said that I'm now having slight self-doubt wrt huge pages, though
I swear we investigated it last year when first discussing this feature.
The guest memory will of course already be suitably aligned, but I'm
wondering if the filesystem I/O places any offset alignment constraints
related to non-default page size.
