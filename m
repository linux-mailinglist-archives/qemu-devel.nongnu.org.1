	I'm the annoying root cause of this as I had filed this:
https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/2797#note_2326724893

Which was really a question around providing more memory options, I'm
happy seeing a lot of thought has gone into my simple question/request,
but it's unclear reading this thread where things concluded.

	Is there a chance these are in a branch that one could build
against to get consensus on some of this style vs substance stuff?  I
get it that it's tricky and do generally think that one could restrict
armhf vs arm64 to having 64-bit support in the (hypervisor) OS.

	I was wanting to tweak some disk images before imaging a bunch
of nvme for use and saw using kvm/qemu as a straightforward path to
doing that on my laptop (x86_64) before firing up a bunch of compute
modules etc.
