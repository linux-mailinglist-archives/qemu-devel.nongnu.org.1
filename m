What exactly is the impact of this issue to the device state series?
From the cover letter:

  * qemu_loadvm_load_thread_pool now reports error via migrate_set_error()
  instead of dedicated load_threads_ret variable.

  * Since the change above uncovered an issue with respect to multifd send
  channels not terminating TLS session properly QIOChannelTLS now allows
  gracefully handling this situation.

I understand qemu_loadvm_load_thread_pool() is attempting to use
migrate_set_error() but an error is already set by the recv_thread. Is
that the issue? I wonder if we could isolate somehow this so it doesn't
impact this series.

>=20=20=20

For premature_ok, we need to make sure it will not hang QEMU if the
connection gets unexpectedly closed. The current code checks for
shutdown() having already happened, which is fine because it means we're
already on the way out. However, if any ol' recv() can now ignore a
premature termination error, then the recv_thread will not trigger
cleanup of the multifd_recv threads.
