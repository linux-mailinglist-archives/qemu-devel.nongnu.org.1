We have used rdma migration with HCA from Nvidia for years, our
experience is RDMA migration works better than tcp (over ipoib).

Switching back to TCP will lead us to the old problems which was
solved by RDMA migration.

+cc some guys from Huawei.

I'm surprised RDMA users are rare,  I guess maybe many are just
working with different code base.
