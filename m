Thanks for explaining. That makes sense - I was looking in the Qemu source
for where exactly it was polling the GLib/GTK event handler, now I know why
I couldn't find it. Tracing the poll_func setting, it looks like GTK
expects g_main_context_iteration() to be called regularly, or the main
thread needs to call and block inside g_main_loop_run.

But in QEMU it's not as easy a fix as just going ahead and doing one of
those two things because QEMU semi-replicates the GLib poll function, and
we can't use both at the same time. Right?

OK, I've created a new issue on GitLab where any further decision making
and action can be tracked:

https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/2676

I'm not sure this patchset is the best place for a patch blocking GTK on
macOS, especially if you want it in 9.2.

We already have extremely careful threading code in patch 02/15 for safely
interfacing the threading models of the PV Graphics/libdispatch world and
QEMU's world of BQL, AIOs, BHs, and so on.

Sorry, this was in reference to Daniel Berrang=C3=A9's comment on this rela=
ted
bug: https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/2537#note_2203183775
(QEMU's SDL UI also falls afoul of macOS's threading requirements in some
specific cases.)
