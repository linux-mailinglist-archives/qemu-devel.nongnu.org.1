I'd agree it is something AI could likely come up with, given the
right prompt, but in terms of defining policy that conceptally
feels more like new functionality, mixed in with refactoring.

What matters is not whether Coccinelle was practical to use
or not, and also not whether it was possible to express the
concept in its particular language.

Rather I'm thinking about it as a conceptual guide for whether
a change might be expressible as a plain transformation or not.

I don't think the meson change satisfies that, because you
wouldn't express the new class level properties, or the new
get_or_create_cfg code as an algorithmic refactoring. Those
are a case of creative coding.

When we talk about "limited / non-creative refactoring", my interpretation
would be that it conceptually applies to changes which could be describe as
an algorithmic transformation. This prompt and the resulting code feel like
more than that. The prompt is expressing a creative change, and while the
result includes some algorithmic refactoring it, includes other stuff too.

Describing a policy that allows your meson example, in a way that will be
interpreted in a reasonably consistent way by contributors looks like a
challenge to me.

On the flip side, you might have written the new property / getter method
manually and asked the agent to finish the conversion, and that would
have been acceptable. This is a can or worms to express in a policy.

With regards,
Daniel
