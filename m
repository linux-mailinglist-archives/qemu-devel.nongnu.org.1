This seems to add one more layer to maintain, and so far I don't know
whether it's a must.

To put it simple, can we simply rely on qemu cmdline as "the guest ABI"?  I
thought it was mostly the case already, except some extremely rare
outliers.

When we have one host that boots up a VM using:

  $QEMU1 $cmdline

Then another host boots up:

  $QEMU2 $cmdline -incoming XXX

Then migration should succeed if $cmdline is exactly the same, and the VM
can boot up all fine without errors on both sides.

AFAICT this has nothing to do with what kernel is underneath, even not
Linux?  I think either QEMU1 / QEMU2 has the option to fail.  But if it
didn't, I thought the ABI should be guaranteed.

That's why I think this is a migration violation, as 99.99% of other device
properties should be following this rule.  The issue here is, we have the
same virtio-net-pci cmdline on both sides in this case, but the ABI got
break.

That's also why I was suggesting if the property contributes to the guest
ABI, then AFAIU QEMU needs to:

  - Firstly, never quietly flipping any bit that affects the ABI...

  - Have a default value of off, then QEMU will always allow the VM to boot
    by default, while advanced users can opt-in on new features.  We can't
    make this ON by default otherwise some VMs can already fail to boot,

  - If the host doesn't support the feature while the cmdline enabled it,
    it needs to fail QEMU boot rather than flipping, so that it says "hey,
    this host does not support running such VM specified, due to XXX
    feature missing".

That's the only way an user could understand what happened, and IMHO that's
a clean way that we stick with QEMU cmdline on defining the guest ABI,
while in which the machine type is the fundation of such definition, as the
machine type can decides many of the rest compat properties.  And that's
the whole point of the compat properties too (to make sure the guest ABI is
stable).

If kernel breaks it easily, all compat property things that we maintain can
already stop making sense in general, because it didn't define the whole
guest ABI..

So AFAIU that's really what we used for years, I hope I didn't overlook
somehting.  And maybe we don't yet need the "-platform" layer if we can
keep up with this rule?

Thanks,
