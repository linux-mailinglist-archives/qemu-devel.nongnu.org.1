If you're going to go to the trouble of adding multiple tags
to the commit for each author who participated, then IMHO they
should all be Signed-off-by. IOW, either just have S-o-B from
the main author within a company, or have S-o-B for every
author. Co-developed-by doesn't have value IMHO.

It is a judgement call as to whether a Reviewed-by/etc should be
kept or dropped. It depends on the scale of the changes that
were made to the commit since the Reviewed-by/etc was first given.

Common practice is for Signed-off-by tags to be kept in time order
from earliest author to latest author / maintainer. Common case is
2 S-o-B, the first from the patch author, and the last from the
sub-system maintainer who sends the pull request.

For other tags I don't see any broadly acceptable pattern. Some people
add Reviewed-by before the S-o-B, others add Reviewed-by after the
S-o-B. Either is fine IMHO.

If patch submitted still contains any code that can be considered
copyrightable (ie anything non-trivial) from the original author,
then I would expect the original authors Signed-off-by to be retained.

I think the cases where it is ok to use Originally-by, without a
Signed-off-by, would be exceedingly.

Daniel
