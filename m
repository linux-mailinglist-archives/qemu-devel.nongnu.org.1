The cluster related topology information under "/sys/devices/system/cpu/
cpu*/topology" indicates the L2 cache topology (CPUID[0x4]), not module
level CPU topology (CPUID[0x1f]).

So far, kernel hasn't exposed module topology related sysfs. But we will
add new "module" related information in sysfs. The relevant patches are
ready internally, but not posted yet.

In the future, we will use "module" in sysfs to indicate module level CPU
topology, and "cluster" will be only used to refer to the l2 cache domain
as it is now.

This patch set mainly tries to configure the module level CPU topology
for Guest, which will be aligned with the future module information in
the sysfs, so that it doesn't violate the kernel x86 arch's definition
or current end users' expectation for x86's cluster.

Zhao
