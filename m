I've run out of time to sort out cover letters and things + just before the merge
window is never a good time get anyone to pay attention to potentially controversial
patches.  So for now I've thrown up a branch on kernel.org with Robert's
series of fixes of related code (that's queued in the ACPI tree for the merge window)
and Dan Williams (from several years ago) + my additions that 'work' (lightly tested)
on qemu/arm64 with the generic port patches etc. 

I'll send out an RFC in a couple of weeks.  In meantime let me know if you
run into any problems or have suggestions to improve them.

p.s. Apparently my computer is in the future. (-28 minutes and counting!)
