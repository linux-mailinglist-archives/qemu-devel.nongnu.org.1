I think, it was to avoid Coverity false-positive around further code

         WITH_GRAPH_RDLOCK_GUARD() {
             ret = bdrv_co_is_allocated_above(bs, s->base_overlay, true, offset,
                                              bytes, &count);
         }
         if (ret < 0) {
             return ret;
         }

which you don't touch here. I think "= -1;" should be kept. Or I missed static analyzes revolution (if so, it should be mentioned in commit message).
