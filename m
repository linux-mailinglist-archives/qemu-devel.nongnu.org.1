I see.  That's unfortunate..

Though this is also the case where it shouldn't be VFIO's problem alone.
See some other users of log_sync():

vhost_sync_dirty_bitmap():
    if (!dev->log_enabled || !dev->started) {
        return 0;
    }

kvm_slot_get_dirty_log():
    if (ret == -ENOENT) {
        /* kernel does not have dirty bitmap in this slot */
        ret = 0;
    }

And I didn't further look.

In short, IMHO looks like VFIO still shouldn't be special on differeciating
and make migration export the SETUP phase just for this..  as VFIO has
log_start() like all the rest, so VFIO can also know whether tracking is
enabled at all, then it can silently no-op the log_sync() like all the rest
of the users.

If you agree, I'd prefer we keep this patch - it'll be nice we only ever
expose migration_is_running() for migration status checks, without exposing
SETUP only for this VFIO use case even if it could have followed what other
modules are doing.

If you would like to propose a patch for VFIO, I'd be happy to include your
patch before this patch (just in case this patch could land some day) to
make sure VFIO works as before.  Since I don't have VFIO HW to test, it'll
be challenging for me to propose and test such patch otherwise.

Thanks,
