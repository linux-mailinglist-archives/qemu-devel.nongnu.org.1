 Thank you, Eric, for the thorough information=E2=80=94truly appreciate it.

Just to confirm what I understood, when we are reading a bitmap with
'x-dirty-bitmap' (for powered on vm of course), the 'start' is always a
logical offset no matter whether the record has 'offset' value or not. Is
this correct?

Also, I came across a case wherein we get the entire disk as allocated for
a raw format disk which is present on lvm or lvm-thin storage (the disk has
just a few MB data added, and the vm is in running state). Here is an
example of 1Gb data. Is this expected behaviour?
[{ "start": 0, "length": 1073741824, "depth": 0, "present": true, "zero":
false, "data": true, "compressed": false, "offset": 0}]

Regards,
Prashant

&gt; I have a few questions about the bitmap content shown by &#39;qemu-img=

when &#39;present&#39; is true such as in the case of compression.<br>
<br>
When it comes to exposing a qcow2 file over NBD, you generally want to<br>
have:<br>
<br>
qemu-nbd using &#39;-f qcow2&#39; =3D&gt; raw view =3D&gt; qemu-img using &=

<br>
qemu-nbd using &#39;-f raw&#39; =3D&gt; qcow2 view =3D&gt; qemu-img using &=
#39;-f qcow2&#39;<br>
<br>
to expose the bare-metal qcow2 contents over the wire, but that gets<br>
less testing, in part because if you make the image writable, it tends<br>
to cause problems if the client writing to the qcow2 layer needs to<br>
allocate (since NBD does not have a resize command).=C2=A0 Having the<br>

file it is serving (if you expose qcow2 bits over the wire, the server<br>
treats the entire file as allocated, and there is is no dirty bitmap<br>
context for the client to read over NBD).<br>
<br>
Therefore, &#39;start&#39; and &#39;offset&#39; are going to be identical i=
f you are<br>
using qemu-img map to read bitmaps from a server, since bitmaps can<br>
only be read when the wire has the raw view (not the qcow2 view).<br>
<br>
But when you add x-dirty-bitmap into the mix, you are asking qemu to<br>
DISREGARD the normal rules of backing file information and instead<br>
report on dirty bitmap information as if it were backing file info.<br>
This means that anywhere the dirty bitmap response differs from a<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; map with x-dirty-bitmap image-opts.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Here, this works, but feels like a hack, because it is relying on=
 the<br>
&gt; &gt; x-dirty-bitmap feature of qemu.=C2=A0 The libnbd project ships wi=
th an<br>
&gt; &gt; application &#39;nbdinfo --map&#39; that can read the same inform=
ation as<br>
&gt; &gt; &#39;qemu-img map&#39; but with a much nicer layout.=C2=A0 It&#39=
;s not going to<br>
&gt; &gt; necessarily be faster, but because it is a fully-supported featur=
e of<br>
&gt; &gt; libnbd rather than a hack in qemu, it may prove more stable in th=
e<br>
&gt; &gt; long run, and certainly easier to understand.<br>
<br>
<br>
For a worked example:<br>
<br>
# Create an image, dirty two different offsets, with a bitmap created in be=
tween<br>
$ qemu-img create -f qcow2 foo.qcow2 3M<br>
Formatting &#39;foo.qcow2&#39;, fmt=3Dqcow2 cluster_size=3D65536 extended_l=
2=3Doff compression_type=3Dzlib size=3D3145728 lazy_refcounts=3Doff refcoun=
t_bits=3D16<br>
$ qemu-io -f qcow2 foo.qcow2 -c &#39;w 1M 512&#39;<br>
wrote 512/512 bytes at offset 1048576<br>
512 bytes, 1 ops; 00.01 sec (42.906 KiB/sec and 85.8112 ops/sec)<br>
$ qemu-img bitmap -f qcow2 foo.qcow2 --add b1<br>
$ qemu-io -f qcow2 foo.qcow2 -c &#39;w 2M 512&#39;<br>
wrote 512/512 bytes at offset 2097152<br>
512 bytes, 1 ops; 00.00 sec (107.735 KiB/sec and 215.4704 ops/sec)<br>
<br>
# Now, expose the raw bytes of the image over NBD, and inspect with nbdinfo=
<br>
<br>
$ qemu-nbd -f qcow2 foo.qcow2 -A -Bb1 -t<br>
$ nbdinfo --map=3Dqemu:dirty-bitmap:b1 nbd://localhost<br>

Comparing those to qemu-img map --output=3Djson should be instructive.<br>
