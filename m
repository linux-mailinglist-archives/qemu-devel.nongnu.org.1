But EBUSY means the VMM messed up and tried to do something it shouldn't,
which is to change the configuration of the VCPU after it already ran.
EINVAL isn't a VMM mess up. It wanted to disable the extension and will
remove it from the ISA string, KVM just can't guarantee that the guest
won't be able to use it anyway (making that a warn case). So, EBUSY isn't
a warn case (but it's also not something we'd expect to see in a function
called from kvm_arch_init_vcpu()). However, KVM is free to add new errors,
so I'd only warn for the ones which translate to warn cases (EINVAL).
