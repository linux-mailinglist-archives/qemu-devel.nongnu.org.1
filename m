Downtimes with the device state transfer being disabled / enabled:
             4 VFs   2 VFs    1 VF
Disabled: 1783 ms  614 ms  283 ms
Enabled:  1068 ms  434 ms  274 ms

Will add these numbers to the cover letter of the next patch set version.

It's ~100 MiB of device state per VF here.

And it's 70ms of downtime *per device*:
so with 4 VF it's ~280ms of downtime taken by the config loads.
That's a lot - with perfect parallelization this downtime should
*reduce by* 210ms.

I think that's something we can do after we have parallel config loads
and it turns out their downtime for some reason still scales strongly
linearly with the number of VFIO devices (rather than taking roughly
constant time regardless of the count of these devices if running perfectly
in parallel).

My gut feeling is that is feasible overall but it's too much of a rabbit
hole for the first version of this device state transfer feature.

I think it will need some deeper QEMU core address space management changes,
which need to be researched/developed/tested/reviewed/etc. on their own.

If it was an easy task I would have gladly included such support in this
patch set version already for extra downtime reduction :)

As I wrote above, it's not 70 ms total but 70 ms per device.

Also, even 70 ms is a lot, considering that the default downtime limit
is 300 ms - with a single device that's nearly 1/4 of the limit already.

That's not exactly how this API is supposed to work.

I suspect that you took that "it might not be called again until
qemu_loadvm_load_finish_ready_broadcast() is invoked" as prohibition
from being called again until that signal is broadcast.

The intended meaning of that sentence was "it is possible that it won't
be called again until qemu_loadvm_load_finish_ready_broadcast() is invoked".

In other words, the migration core is free to call this handler how
many times the migration core wants.

But if the handler wants be *sure* that it will get called by the
migration core after the handler has returned "not ready" then it needs
to arrange for load_finish_ready_broadcast() to be invoked somehow.

I can certainly implement the task-queuing approach instead of the
load_finish() handler API if you like such approach more.

As I wrote above, even 70ms for a single device is a lot considering the
default downtime limit - and that's even more true if multiplied by
multiple devices.

We need to have the receiving threads decoupled from the VFIO device state
loading threads at least because otherwise:
1) You can have a deadlock if device state for multiple devices arrives
out of order, like here:

Time flows left to right (->).
Multifd channel 1: (VFIO device 1 buffer 2) (VFIO device 2 buffer 1)
Multifd channel 2: (VFIO device 2 buffer 2) (VFIO device 1 buffer 1)

Both channel receive/load threads would be stuck forever in this case,
since they can't load buffer 2 for devices 1 and 2 until they load
buffer 1 for each of these devices.

2) If devices are loading buffers at different speeds you don't want
to block the faster device from receiving new buffer just because
the slower one hasn't finished its loading yet.

Yes, exactly - to wait for save threads to finish only after non-iterables
have already been saved.

By "low hanging fruit" I meant it should be a fairly easy change.

I understand your point here, however as I wrote above, I think that's too
much downtime to "waste" so I will try to rework the load_finish() handler
into the task-queuing approach as you suggested earlier.
