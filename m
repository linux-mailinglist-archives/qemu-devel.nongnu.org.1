Understand.

Have you considered cutting the series in half before the inliner?
First part emits "The members of ..." like the old doc generator.
Second part replaces that with inlined material.

We could totally release with just the first half!  Inlining is great,
but even without it, your work looks so much better and is so much more
usable.

I think we could even do it after "turn on".  Yes, it's a small
regression, but I believe the improvements are big enough to outweigh
small regressions like this one.

No, only structs and unions are "Object", alternates are "Alternate".

For me, the separation between struct and union is an unfortunate
remnant of somewhat winding development history.

A union is has common members, one of them is the tag, and for each tag
value, it may have variant members.

A struct is a degenerate union: no variants.

This is as old as the hills: Pascal records are just like this.

QMP introspection doesn't show structs and unions, just objects, which
may or may not have variants.

The schema language syntax, however, is still rooted (stuck?) in a past
when unions could not have common members other than the tag.
