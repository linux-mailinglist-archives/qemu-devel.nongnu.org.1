For now, we don't have live-update with fd-passing, I'm working on it. But we do
have working live-update with starting second QEMU process.

I hope, that finally support for fd-passing in management layer will only
need three steps:

- use unix-socket as migration channel
- enable new migration capability (and probably some options to enable feature per device)
- opt-out the code [1], which implements logic of switching TAP and disk for new QEMU instance

And I don't think we want to remove this logic [1] completely, as we may want to do
normal migration without fds at some moment, for example to change the backend. Or
to jump-over some theoretical future problems with fds passing (that's a new experimental
feature, there may be bugs, or even future incompatible changes (until it become stable).

cpr-transfer needs additional steps:

- more complex interface to setup two migration channels
- tricky logic about unavailable QMP for target process at start

Still, that's possible.

Seems, we discussed.

As I understand, it should work the same way like for normal migration:
we add -incoming defer to cpr-exec-command, and after exec we can add
our infrastructure through QMP interface, and than run "migrate-incoming".

Still, that would be done during downtime, unlike cpr-transfer, where source
is still running during target QMP setup.

So exec mode works more like migrating to file, and than restore from it.

Maybe, we may have a mediator program, which gets migration stream and fds
from source QEMU together with fds, than we start new QEMU process in same
container, and it gets the incoming migration stream together with fds
from the mediator?

Probably target QEMU itself may be used as this mediator, but we'll need an
option to buferise somehow the incoming migration state (together with fds),
and only start to apply it when source QEMU is closed.

How much exec mode would differ from such setup?
