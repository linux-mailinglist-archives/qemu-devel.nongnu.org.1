but in general if you set as output 'as' the system_address_memory it
rather means you have no translation in place. This is what I am not
convinced about.

you say it aims at
- avoiding stage-1 translation - allow VFIO devices to attach to the
system address space that the VFIO core will monitor to take care of
stage-2 mappings. Can you achieve the same goals with a proper address
space?

understood. although I am not sure using system address space is the
best choice. But I may not be the best person to decide about this.

OK. I understand the needs but I am unsure using system address space is
the good choice.
