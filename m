_native_ PCIe hotplug? :)

hm but why you don't keep the machine option "acpi-pcihp" and just don't
set it as "on" by default? I find global options like that a tad difficult
to follow, feels indeed like a trick. Also, I don't like much not
mentioning GPEX in the option name (and only the event notification device, "ged).

Am I missing something why a global would work better than a machine option
when the default is the native PCIe hotplug?

Got it! Thanks.
