Hello,

Since it is a blocking issue for us, we went further and ended up with a solution along [1]
that allows us to get out of this situation.

The idea is to add compatibility properties to restore legacy behaviors for machine types
with older versions of QEMU (<10.1). 2 compatiblity properties have been added to address
respectively the 2 missing features, each one is done in a separate patch.

We know that 10.1 has been released and it's final, but working on a solution towards 11.0
would allow everyone to settle on the fix and even consider backporting where not yet released
like Ubuntu 25.10 for us.

It is important to have upstream support going forward in this or any other way
and therefore reach out with this RFC to ask you to think about it with us.
