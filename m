For Host (docs/system/target-i386.rst).

I'm not aware of any minimum version requirements for Guest supported
by KVM, but there are no commitment.

I agree, legacy kvmclock can be left out, if the old kernel does not
support kvmclock2 and strongly requires kvmclock, it can be enabled
using 9.1 and earlier machines or legacy-kvmclock, as long as Host still
supports it.

What's the gap in handling it this way? especially considering that
kvmclock2 was introduced in v2.6.35, and earlier kernels are no longer
maintained. The availability of the PV feature requires compatibility
for both Host and Guest.

Anyway, the above discussion here is about future plans, and this series
does not prevent any Guest from ignoring kvmclock2 in favor of kvmclock.

What this series is doing, i.e. separating the current two kvmclock and
ensuring CPUID compatibility via legacy-kvmclock, could balance the
compatibility requirements of the ancient (unmaintained kernel) with
the need for future feature changes.

Thanks,
Zhao
