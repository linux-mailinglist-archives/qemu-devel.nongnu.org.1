I agree.

avx10_version needs to be assigned with a default valid value, when user 
enables avx10 explicitly without specifying avx10_version. It also 
applies to (existing) named cpu models other than GraniteRapids-v2 
(which is added by this series). E.g.,

	-cpu GraniteRapids-v1,+avx10

So if you are going to make default value as -1, then you need to add 
something in x86_cpu_load_model()

     if (!def->avx10_version) {
         def->avx10_version = -1;
     }
