Ah, I didn't notice that cpr special cased migrate_ram_is_ignored()..

Shall we stick with the old check, but always require cpr to rely on
ignore-shared?

Then we replace this patch with removing the error_report, probably
together with not caring about whatever is received at all.. would that be
cleaner?
