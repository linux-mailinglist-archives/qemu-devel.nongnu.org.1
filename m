Sorry for the late reply.My test scenario is this:
Server:		Kunpeng-920
VFUI device:	SEC, a Kunpeng hardware accelerator
Host OS:	openEuler 24.03, kernel 6.6, qemu 8.2
Guest OS:	openEuler 24.03
Test steps:
1. Start a VM and run a task using SEC inside the VM
2. Start migration and inject an error into the SEC used by dst-VM
3. The SEC used by dst-VM will be reset. So RESUMING->RUNNING transition 
will fail with probability.(The timing has to be just right)
