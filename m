I see two scenarios

 * Devices where the structs are in the include/..../<blah>.h

   The private/public comments are a message to other code in QEMU about
   which fields are OK to access directly, and which should not be accessed.


 * Devices where the structs are in the ../<blah>.c

   The private/public comments look entirely pointless, as everything
   is private to the .c file.


99% of the time it seems the "parent" / "parent_obj" fields are the only
one marked private. There are a handful of classes where other fields are
under the private comment, but not many. 

With regards,
Daniel
