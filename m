In the coconut-svsm project there's a likely need for coconut to
provide a UEFI variable store, since we can't store plain text
variables in host context for confidential VMs.

Am I right in thinking that this design approach could be reused
in coconut context with coconut providing the equivalent backend
service, and EDK2 using the same driver to talk to either QEMU
or Coconut's service  ?
