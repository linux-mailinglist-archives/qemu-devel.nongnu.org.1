I don't mind the 'x-'. And if that makes it clear, that this is used
without any warrenty, sure!

However I'm not sure where the "risky" comes from. Initially confusion
was given as reason.

Initially I thought about some kind of '--i-really-want-to-do-this'
flag, but somehow I don't really see this device to bethis harmful
to to warrent that big of a deterrent.

Kind regards,
Christian
