Hi Mark,

I wouldn't remove the comment.

Quote from the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s
Manual Volume 2B: Instruction Set Reference, M-U March 2024:

IA-32 Architecture Compatibility
The 16-bit form of SGDT is compatible with the Intel 286 processor if
the upper 8 bits are not referenced. The Intel 286 processor fills these
bits with 1s; processor generations later than the Intel 286 processor
fill these bits with 0s.

Intel still claims the upper 8 bits are filled with 0s, but the
Operation pseudo code below is correct. The same is true for SIDT.

With best regards,
Volker
