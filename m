This is a technicality but for the spirit of conversation and curiosity 
I will reply with my view: we end up calling meson and ninja, yes, but 
they wrap cargo under the hood. Cargo has its own tooling and workflows. 
At the end of compilation it spits out a dynamic or static library. That 
happens independently of QEMU.

If you start writing a new project, you don't go linking it to QEMU 
right away (you can, but there's no need to yet). You make an idiomatic 
Rust crate with rust tooling. FFI calls can exist and you are still able 
to compile/check your crate. This is the typical rust workflow, and it's 
ubiquitous, so I think we should not deprive anyone of it.

The only thing we cannot check with cargo alone is if the crate uses the 
QEMU apis correctly (logic errors, not compilation errors)

Until/if we can build with just meson and rustc (a hypothetical scenario 
at the moment) cargo becomes part of our development and build tools.

I understand your argument and it's not irrational at all. I offer this 
perspective as a Rust developer and not a QEMU developer. As a QEMU 
developer I shouldn't need to care about cargo unless I'm touching part 
of that code; the build system details (the cargo wrapper) can be 
abstracted away for everyone else.
