These are counterparts of similar memory_region_init* functions but
differ in that these allocate the memory region with object_new so the
memory region will be managed by QOM and freed with the owner. This
behaviour was already documented and the reference tracking is
implemented but it could not be used without these functions because
memory_region_init* functions call object_initialize that resets the
free function of the object so it would not be freed.
