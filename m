Actually which mode you use, "never", "always" or "conditional"? Or in downstream you have different approach?

Why am I asking:

These modes (for backup) were developed prior to block-dirty-bitmap-merge command, which allowed to copy bitmaps as you want. With that API, we actually don't need all these modes, instead it's enough to pass a bitmap, which would be _actually_ used by mirror.

So, if you need "never" mode, you just copy your bitmap by block-dirty-bitmap-add + block-dirty-bitmap-merge, and pass a copy to mirror job.

Or, you pass your bitmap to mirror-job, and have a "always" mode.

And I don't see, why we need a "conditional" mode, which actually just drops away the progress we actually made. (OK, we failed, but why to drop the progress of successfully copied clusters?)


Using user-given bitmap in the mirror job has also an additional advantage of live progress: up to visualization of disk copying by visualization of the dirty bitmap contents.
