Yes, per-vcpu error source is a nice idea as we agreed :-)

Correct, Qemu can't bear with memory error storm even with this series
applied.

I need to take a closer look. If two consecutive errors are duplicate
when the problematic error physical addresses falls into same guest
page. The QEMU crash can be avoided by adding more checks. Otherwise,
I need to figure out the fix.

Thanks, Igor. Just posted (v4) and please take your time to review.

Yes, it's actually the plan I had. To improve this series so that it can
be merged soon. After that, I will continue the improvement with per-vcpu
error source. The ultimate goal is to have 16x consecutive errors and
per-vcpu error source combined.
