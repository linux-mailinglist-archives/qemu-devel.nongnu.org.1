Hi,

Thank you for your reply.

I understood the introductory sections of the documentation such as the
"About QEMU" section and the first half of the "system emulation". Sections
and subsections that went into greater detail were a little overwhelming
such as the "QEMU virtio-net standby" subsection [1] or the "migration
features" [2] subsection. But the red hat blogs and deep-dive articles helped
cover a lot of ground conceptually.

I feel once I start getting my hands dirty, I'll be able to absorb these concepts
much better.

I did have two questions that I would like to ask.

Q1.
Regarding the "Deep dive into Virtio-networking and vhost-net" article [3],
the "Introduction" subsection of the "Vhost protocol" section mentions that
sending the available buffer notification involves a vCPU interrupt (4th bullet
point). But in figure 2, the arrow for the "available buffer notification" indicates
a PCI interrupt. Initially I thought they were two different interrupts but I am
a little confused about this now.

Q2.
In the "Virtio-net failover operation" section of the "Virtio-net failover: An
introduction" article [4], there are five bullet points under the first figure.
The second point states that the guest kernel needs the ability to switch
between the VFIO device and the vfio-net device. I was wondering if
"vfio-net" is a typo and if it should be "virtio-net" instead.

Got it. I didn't know this was the first in the series. I have now covered this as
well, so I can move on to "Virtqueues and virtio ring: How the data travels" [3] :)

I would love to start with some hands-on tasks. I'll take a look at
the kernel's "drivers/virtio/virtio_ring.c". I think I should also start
going through the "vhost_shadow_virtqueue.c" [4] source code.

Thank you. Either means of communication works for me although
the latter will require some coordination.

A good balance of theory and practice would be nice at this stage.
It'll keep my brains from getting too muddled up.

Thanks,
Sahil
