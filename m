That was clear but the question was if QOM properties (that are not qdev 
properties) exist and if so are they also exposed? If not exposed it may 
be used for internal properties (where simpler solutions aren't 
convenient) but maybe qdev also adds easier definition of properties 
that's why they used instead of QOM properties?

If a device is pluggable, theoretically a user could create a machine from 
them declaratively, e.g. starting from a "none" machine or like plugging 
cards in a motherboard so their properties should be exposed as long as 
those properties correspond to the device pins they model or configurable 
options. Only properties that are implementation details should not be 
exposed because setting them can break the device. There are a few places 
where we have such properties. But you say "in places" so I think you 
meant the same.

Question is if we want to allow users to tweak these compatibility 
options, like selectively enable/disable when migrating between QEMU 
versions or for testing. It might have some uses and maybe that's the 
reason why people would like these to go through deprecation instead of 
just dropping them. Marking some properties not exposed would get the same 
resistance then so may not solve the issue.
