I asked because I think patch 1 itself is still an improvement, which
avoids src VM from crashing when hitting poisoned pages.  Especially IIUC
on some arch (Intel?) it's a complete fix.

But for sure we can keep them as a whole series if you want, but then it'll
be good you add some more reviewers; at least some ARM/AMD developers,
perhaps.

One more hint, please double check though: in QEMU's use case (e.g. precopy
only, while not using postcopy) I think you may even be able to install the
poisoned pte without MISSING (or any other uffd) mode registered.

You can try creating one uffd descriptor (which will bind the desc with the
current mm context; in this case we need it to happen only on dest qemu),
then try injecting poison ptes anywhere in the guest address ranges.

I suppose here you meant AO errors only.

IIUC the major issue regarding migration is AO errors will become ARs on
src qemu when vcpu accessed, which means AOs are all fine if not forwarded
to guest.  However after migration that is not guaranteed.  Poisoned ptes
properly installed on dest basically grants QEMU the ability to "migrate a
poisoned page", meanwhile without really wasting a physical page on dest,
making sure those AO error addrs keep generating ARs even after migration.

It seems the 1st patch is still needed even in this case?

Thanks,
