Except I fat-fingered "Currently".

Note, that this message requires setting up additional channel of server -> client communication. That was the reason, why the "change-msg" solution was rejected in our downstream: it's safer to reuse existing channel (QMP), than to add and support an additional channel.

Suggest to work this into the commit message.

Suggest to explain the race in the comment.  Perhaps like this:

  Guest-visible configuration is stored in device memory.  There is a
  race between updating and migrating it: if we update it before we
  migrate it, it's migrated fine, but if any later updates are lost.

Sounds like we'd make an interrupt pending on the source, but migration
failed to make it pending on the target as well, so it gets lost.

Is that the case?

If yes, question for migration experts: why isn't this a problem
elsewhere, too?

Thanks!
