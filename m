Yes, and I also was under the impression that there is no desire to
re-introduce arbitrary key-value pairs with QMP/blockdev options.

As written in the commit message, the cache option should not apply to
all volumes, so using configuration files is rather impractical there.

I'd prefer defining the cache option(s) explicitly, and have people add
additional key-value pairs they require explicitly going forward. But if
you really don't want me to, I can still go with the unstable, arbitrary
strings approach instead.
