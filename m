The distance between @deprecated-props and parts of its documentation
bothers me a bit.

On closer examination, more questions on CpuModelInfo emerge.  Uses:

* query-cpu-model-comparison both arguments

  Documentation doesn't say how exactly the command uses the members of
  CpuModelInfo, i.e. @name, @props, @deprecated-props.  Can you tell me?

* query-cpu-model-expansion argument @model and return value member
  @model.

  The other argument is the expansion type, on which the value of return
  value model.deprecated-props depends, I believe.  Fine.

  Documentation doesn't say how exactly the command uses the members of
  CpuModelInfo arguments, i.e. @name, @props, @deprecated-props.  Can
  you tell me?

* query-cpu-model-baseline both arguments and return value member
  @model.

  Same, except we don't have an expansion type here.  So same question,
  plus another one: how does return value model.deprecated-props behave?

If you can't answer my questions, we need to find someone who can.
