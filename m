Not sure whether there's other opinions, but that's definitely fine by me.

I think it even makes more sense, as even if Libvirt probed the host and
auto-on the feature, it also means Libvirt made a decision for the user,
saying "having a better performance" is more important than "being able to
migrate this VM everywhere".

I don't see a way that can make such fair decision besides requesting the
user to opt-in always for those, then the user is fully aware what is
enabled, with the hope that when a migration fails later with "target host
doesn't support feature XXX" the user is crystal clear on what happened.

Thanks,
