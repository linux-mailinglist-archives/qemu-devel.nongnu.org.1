It should be both block-job-change and job-change.

Having job-change in block-core.json rather than job.json is ugly, but
if Markus doesn't complain, why would I.

I consider these strictly optional. We don't really have strong reasons
to deprecate these commands (they are just thin wrappers), and I think
libvirt still uses block-job-* in some places.

We also need to check if the interfaces are really the same. For
example, JobInfo is only a small subset of BlockJobInfo. Some things
could be added to JobInfo, other things like BlockDeviceIoStatus don't
really have a place there, so we would have to introduce job type
specific data in query-jobs first.

I'm sure it's all doable, but it might be more work than your list above
would make you think.

Of course, this cleanup assumes that steps 3.-5. are really implemented.
If not, you would end up moving a lot more block related things to
job.json than after them.
