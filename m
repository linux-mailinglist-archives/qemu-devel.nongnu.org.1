IMHO having an invariant measurement for a given guest configuration
is a critical guarantee. We should not be allowing guest attestation
to break as a side-effect of upgrading a software component, while
keeping the guest config unchanged.

IOW, I'd view measurement as being "guest ABI", and versioned machine
types are there to provide invariant guest ABI.

Personally, if we want simplicitly then just not using KVM_SEV_INIT2
at all would be the easiest option. SEV/SEV-ES are legacy technology
at this point, so we could be justified in leaving it unchanged and
only focusing on SEV-SNP. Unless someone can say what the critical
*must have* benefit of using KVM_SEV_INIT2 is ?

With regards,
Daniel
