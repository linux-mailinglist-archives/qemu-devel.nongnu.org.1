Could we consider to hide the concerned commands from introspection 
related commands as well? The same way we prevent those commands to be 
registered, we can probably prevent them from being visible for libvirt.
The code would still be there, and compiled once, but based on runtime 
target_X() value, it would not appear in introspected schema.

I'm not sure how all this is implemented from QAPI code generator, maybe 
it's hard to do something like this, if we build the schema at compile 
time for instance.

At this point, do we know which kind of "feature" gets probed? Is it 
only the list of commands available, or is there probes based on 
enum/struct definition?
If yes, the latter seems to be a wrong way to identify a target, when it 
could simply use query-target.

Thanks for considering an alternative way given the new needs, that's 
appreciated.

Would that possible to get some help from people from libvirt or QAPI 
developers for this?
