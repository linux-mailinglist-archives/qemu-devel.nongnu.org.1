I am not familiar with RIM. A link to read more about it would be helpful.

Is this a well known manufacturer key that one would expect for 
signature verification or is it locally created?

Hopefully just calculating a hash over the image will do and the 
location an image was loaded to, like address A (relocation?), doesn't 
matter...
