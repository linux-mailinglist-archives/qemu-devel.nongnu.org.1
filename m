Hi tugouxp,

Essentially, it's an environment with two nested aarch64 VMs running on an x86 host? I can hardly believe it — that's a genius idea! I'm quite concerned about its performance, though. Will it be very slow and laggy?

Yes, a virtualization-capable aarch64 TCG VM can be set up using 
-machine virt,virtualization=on regardless of the host architecture, 
including on an x86 host, thanks to QEMU’s TCG cross-architecture 
dynamic translation mechanism. TCG emulates the guest CPU and system 
well enough that the guest OS sees and can exercise ARM virtualization 
extensions (EL2 and Stage-2), so from the guest kernel’s perspective the 
machine does genuinely have virtualization support enabled. This makes 
setting up a KVM VM inside this TCG guest reasonable.

In fact, the Linux kernel and the qemu-system-* binaries running inside 
the TCG host VM are the same binaries you would run on a physical 
machine — there is no modification or special build for this TCG 
environment. Of course, performance will be slower than on real 
hardware, as TCG interprets and translates guest instructions in 
software rather than executing them directly on physical virtualization 
extensions; however, for workloads that are not heavily I/O-intensive, 
simple tests work fine. For example, I passed through a PCIe NVMe device 
to the nested VM, mounted it, and was able to read and write files on it 
just like on real hardware.


I'm sure it is doable to do this on aarch64. But I'm not sure how it is 
on x86_64/i386. I did a cursory search of the code and found it seems to 
be unsupported to setup a TCG VM with virtualization-capability enabled 
on x86_64/i386. But I'm not familiar with this so we may need an x86 
specialist to help with this.


> By the way, isn't the KVM （because you use --enale-kvm in the nested aarch64 vm) in the aarch64 VM also emulated? After all, KVM can only be used on the same ISA architecture.

They are all emulated and all aarch64 machine.
