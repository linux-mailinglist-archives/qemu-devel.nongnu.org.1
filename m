My recollection of the intent behind the quoted section is:

1. Structures in shared memory that point to shared memory must used
   relative offsets instead of absolute physical addresses.
2. Virtqueue requests that refer to shared memory (e.g. map this page
   from virtiofs file to this location in shared memory) must use
   relative offsets instead of absolute physical addresses.

In other words, shared memory must be relocatable. Don't assume Shared
Memory Regions have an absolute guest physical address. This makes
device implementations independent of the guest physical memory layout
and might also help when Shared Memory Regions are exposed to guest
user-space where the guest physical memory layout isn't known.
