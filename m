Yes, &error_fatal is almost always wrong after the guest starts.

When it isn't wrong, it's quite convenient.

Yup :)

That's a low quality bar indeed.  Here's mine:

1. A warning should make perfectly clear whether this is a bug that
should be reported, or an issue with usage, resources, etc. that can be
ignored, but may help understand future trouble, if any (typically an
ordinary error that wasn't fully handled).  Our errors make bug
vs. ordinary error clear.

2. A warning of the former kind (bug) should provide information
developers need to start debugging.  For errors, we give them a core
dump, source file and line number.  For warnings, we currently give them
grep and warm wishes.

3. A warning of the latter kind (not a bug) should at least try to
provide hints that help users diagnose and correct / work around what's
wrong.  "warning: failed to WSAEventSelect()" doesn't.  "warning:
trouble initializing slirp for user mode networking" might.
