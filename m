When I eyeballed the previous iteration, I made a few observations[1].
Let's see what has changed.

} New table of contents shows one level, old two.  No objection; the
} navigation thingie on the left is more useful anyway.

No change.  Okay.

} The new generator elides unreferenced types.  Generally good, but two
} observations:
}=20
} * QapiErrorClass is unreferenced, but its members are mentioned in
}   Errors sections.  QapiErrorClass serves as better than nothing error
}   code documentation, but it's gone in the new doc.  So this is a minor
}   regression.  We can figure out what to do about it later.
}=20
} * Section "QMP errors" is empty in the new doc, because its entire
}   contents is elided.  I guess we should elide the section as well, but
}   it's fine to leave that for later.

Unreferenced types are back.  Okay; we can elide them later.

} Old doc shows a definition's since information like any other section.
} New doc has it in the heading box.  Looks prettier and uses much less
} space.  Not sure the heading box is the best place, but it'll do for
} now, we can always move it around later.

No change.

} The new doc's headings use "Struct" or "Union" where the old one uses
} just "Object".  Let's keep "Object", please.

Fixed.

} In the new doc, some member references are no longer rendered as such,
} e.g. @on-source-error and @on-target-error in BackupCommon's note.
} Another small regression.

Fixed.

} Union branches are busted in the new generator's output.  I know they
} used to work, so I'm not worried about it.

Fixed: "When TAG-MEMBER is VALUE; The members of BRANCH-TYPE."

The semicolon feels odd.  I'd use a colon there.  Or put the when at the
end like the old generator does: "The members of BRANCH-TYPE when
TAG-MEMBER is VALUE".

Side effects, I think:

* Members of explicit base types are no longer inlined.  Instead: "The
  members of BASE-TYPE."

* Members of explicit command / event argument types are no longer
  inlined.  Instead: "The members of ARG-TYPE."

Both fine for the initial version.

} The new doc shows the return type, the old doc doesn't.  Showing it is
} definitely an improvement, but we need to adjust the doc text to avoid
} silliness like "Returns: SnapshotInfo =E2=80=93 SnapshotInfo".

No change.  Can polish on top.

} The new doc shows Arguments / Members, Returns, and Errors in two-column
} format.  Looks nice.  But for some reason, the two columns don't align
} horizontally for Errors like they do for the others.  Certainly not a
} blocker of anything, but we should try to fix it at some point.

No change.  Fine to leave for later.

} The new doc doesn't show non-definition conditionals, as mentioned in
} the cover letter.  It shows definition conditionals twice.  Once should
} suffice.

No change.  You asked for advice, and I gave some[2].

} There's probably more, but this is it for now.

Again, this is it for now.
