Yes it's still one user, but it's not that straightforward to see, also
it's still an extension to how we use mr->refcount right now.  Currently
it's about "true / false" just to describe, now it's a real counter.

I wished that counter doesn't even exist if we'd like to stick with device
/ owner's counter.  Adding this can definitely also make further effort
harder if we want to remove mr->refcount.

Could you elaborate why it's still visible to the guest if
owner->refcount==0 && mr->container!=NULL?

Firstly, mr->container != NULL means the MR has an user indeed.  It's the
matter of who's using it.  If that came from outside this device, it should
require memory_region_ref(mr) before hand when adding the subregion, and
that will hold one reference on the owner->refcount.

Here owner->refcount==0 means there's no such reference, so it seems to me
it's guaranteed to not be visible to anything outside of this device / owner.
Then from that POV it's safe to unlink when the owner is finalizing just
like what we do with mr->subregions, no?
