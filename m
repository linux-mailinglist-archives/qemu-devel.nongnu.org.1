We use the same code (handwritten QMP core) up to QObject and from
QObject on.

In between, we use QObject input/output visitors with generated C data
types for commands implemented in C, and Serde-generated
deserializers/serializers with generated Rust data types for commands
implemented in Rust.

Correct?

We end up with two separate ways to do the same job, which is kind of
sad.

I gather the alternative would be to use generated QAPI visitors for the
generated Rust data types instead of Serde.  This would be unusual for
Rust code: Serde exists and works, so reinvent it would be wasteful and
dumb.

Gut feeling: sticking to how things are usually done (here: with Serde)
is the more prudent choice.

The string visitors have long been a thorn in my side.

I wish QOM wasn't so annoyingly flexible.  I wish a property had to be
of QAPI type (possibly complex).  Less headaches.  Less boilerplate,
too.

Almost all QOM properties are.  And the few that aren't feel like bad
ideas to me.

Recall the callback gets the new property value wrapped in an input
visitor.  Whereas a C setter extracts it into some C variable(s), a Rust
setter extracts it into a QObject, which it then passes to Serde for
deserialization into Rust variables.  Correct?

This is the alternative mentioned above.

Converters between C and Rust data types let us cut at the C data type
instead of at QObject.

We use the same code up to QAPI-generated C data type and from
QAPI-generated C data type on.

In between, we work directly with the C data type for properties
implemented in C, and convert to and from the Rust data type for
properties implemented in Rust.

Correct?

The simplest such converters convert via QObject.  Grossly inefficient
:)

Marc-Andr=C3=A9's prototype demonstrates efficient converters can be had.
The question is whether they're worth their keep.

Thank you!
