Rewriting an existing, maintained component without buy-in from the
maintainers is risky. Mads is the maintainer of simpletrace.py and I am
the overall tracing maintainer. While the performance improvement is
nice, I'm a skeptical about the need for this and wonder whether thought
was put into how simpletrace should evolve.

There are disadvantages to maintaining multiple implementations:
- File format changes need to be coordinated across implementations to
  prevent compatibility issues. In other words, changing the
  trace-events format becomes harder and discourages future work.
- Multiple implementations makes life harder for users because they need
  to decide between implementations and understand the trade-offs.
- There is more maintenance overall.

I think we should have a single simpletrace implementation to avoid
these issues. The Python implementation is more convenient for
user-written trace analysis scripts. The Rust implementation has better
performance (although I'm not aware of efforts to improve the Python
implementation's performance, so who knows).

I'm ambivalent about why a reimplementation is necessary. What I would
like to see first is the TCG binary tracing functionality. Find the
limits of the Python simpletrace implementation and then it will be
clear whether a Rust reimplementation makes sense.

If Mads agrees, I am happy with a Rust reimplementation, but please
demonstrate why a reimplementation is necessary first.
