In 2021 Shashi Mallela sent v8 of GIC ITS patchset [1]. At that time it
was decided to do platform versioning first.

1. https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20210812165341.40784-8-shashi.mallela@linaro.org/

Now we are going through our list of changes for SBSA Reference Platform
and GIC ITS is one of early ones. There was decision that there will be
no option to disable it and platform version will get a minor bump.

First patch is refreshed version of v8 one from 2021. GIC ITS is placed
behind GIC Redistributor in memory space to allow use of older EDK2
firmware.

New address will be placed in DeviceTree for firmware to use - that's a
job for second patch. Which also bumps platform version to 0.2 version.

Trusted Firmware will read GIC ITS address and provide to EDK2 via
Secure Monitor Call (SMC). Same way as it is done with GIC addresses
already.
