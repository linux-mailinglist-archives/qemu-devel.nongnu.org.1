Yes, things should work regardless of what we choose for "accepted" and
"installed": if what the host got is "accepted", we use it, else we put
"installed" in the environment.

This makes sense.

If you want to package $software, you get to package its dependencies.
Simple as that.

Widening the version range of our dependencies can make this a bit
easier.

For a distribution's .0, current stable versions get packaged.  We
better make this as easy as we can.  So the version range needs to
include "current stable".  But why wouldn't it include that ever?

Later on, a wider version range can enable "uneven" upgrades: upgrading
to a new QEMU without also upgrading certain dependencies.

How valuable is this for us?  The answer should inform our choice of
version range.  Extending the range further back can be costly, and it
better be worth it.

I'm rather skeptical here.  Feels like a lot of angst about what
distributions might possibly want to do, with precious little evidence
for what they actually do.  Show me distribution package upgrades
(uneven or not) we enabled by keeping our version range wide, and I'll
reconsider.

For development aids like linters and type checkers, graceful
degradation can make sense.  They must work for developers (who we can
expect to use a reasonably current development environment).  I can't
see why they wouldn't work in a similarly current packaging environment
(i.e. offline), and that's nice.  But I'd loathe to invest much in
keeping development aids work in a non-current environment, especially
not offline.

Bob is driving on the highway listening to the radio.  Suddenly the
music stops for an announcement: there's a wrong-way driver on the
highway!  "One?", Bob exclaims, "*hundreds* of them!"

When nobody else does what we try to do, we might be pioneers, or we
might be fools.
