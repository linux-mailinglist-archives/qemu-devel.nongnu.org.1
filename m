Ok, thanks for the clarification.

Considering the approach you followed, as said before, choosing a 
decoupled solution is the right choice. Plugins should not allow to 
access internal details of QEMU implementation as a general rule.

Did you think about integrating the server directly in the plugin? From 
what I understand, the CHMU will contact the server on a per request 
basis, while instrumentation will contact it for every access.

Beyond communication, the biggest overhead here is to have 
instrumentation on all memory accesses. Another thing that comes out of 
my mind is to do a sampling instrumentation. However, it's not easy to 
do, because the current API does not allow to force a new translation of 
existing TB, and at translation time, you have no clue whether or not 
this will be a hot TB.
What you can do though, is to ignore most of the accesses, and only send 
information every 1000 memory accesses. (Note: I have no idea if 1000 is 
a good threshold :)). It would allow you to skip most of the overhead 
related to communication and hot pages management.

 From what I understood about using plugins, the goal is to track hot 
pages. Using the cache one is a possibility, but it might be better to 
use contrib/plugins/hotpages.c instead, or better, a custom simple 
plugin, simply reporting reads/writes to the server (and implementing 
sampling as well).

Which slow-down factor (order of magnitude) do you have with this series?
