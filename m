I only have a very preliminary understanding on this, so please bare with
me if I'll make silly mistakes...

I was expecting QEMU provides both the global view (address_space_memory),
and the per-vcpu view.  Then we can register to any of them on demand.
Then the global views can be the so-called "board model" mentioned below.

Is it not the case?

The root MR is also shared in this case, making sure the address space
operations internally will share the same flatview.

We have another question to ask besides this design discussion: Peter's
series here solidly fixes a memory leak that can easily reproduce with
x86_64 + KVM on cpu hotplugs.

Should we still merge it first considering it didn't change how we manage
per-vcpu address spaces, but only fixing it?  Then anything like a big
overhaul can happen on top too.
