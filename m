Copied from bdrv_co_is_zero_fast, but that wording can use a similar
treatment.

I picked the original value of qemu_real_host_page_size() based on
file-posix.c's allocate_first_block(); but agree that picking a
constant 64k or even 128k for all platforms (rather than tying it to
the host's page size) won't hurt.  The key point remains that it
should be large enough to account for whatever file-posix.c does, yet
small enough that we aren't negating any potential optimization by the
time spent probing if the image reads as zeroes.
