Hi, Stefan, Maciej,

Sorry to be slow on responding.

Right, AFAIU this is the current use case for VFIO, and anything beyond in
migration context, where we want to use genuine threads with no need to
integrate with the main even loop.

Currently the VFIO workfn should read() the VFIO fd in a blocked way, then
dump them to multifd threads (further dump to migration channels), during
which it can wait on a semaphore.

Right.  It's a pity that g_thread_pool_unprocessed() only monitors
unqueuing of tasks, and looks like there's no g_thread_pool_flush().

Indeed the current thread poll is very aio-centric, and if we worry about
misuse of the APIs we can switch to glib's threadpool.  Sorry Maciej, looks
like I routed you to a direction that I didn't see the side effects..

I think the fundamental request from my side (on behalf of migration) is we
should avoid a specific vmstate handler managing threads on its own.  E.g.,
any future devices (vdpa, vcpu, etc.) that may also be able to offload
save() processes concurrently to threads (just like what VFIO can already
do right now) should share the same pool of threads.  As long as that can
be achieved I am ok.

Thanks,
