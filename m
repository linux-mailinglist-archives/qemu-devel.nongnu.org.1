Yeah, that's exactly the knot this RFC attempts to untangle and which was =

I agree that pluggable devices are much more fuzzy=2E That's why this RFC =
makes a start in spelling out the machines where certain guarantees are mad=
e, and leaves pluggable devices untouched=2E This should allow for KVM to b=
e usable in more machines, where these guarantees are too much of a burden=
=2E

Certainly there is more work to do on pluggable devices=2E And as you stat=
ed above, somebody has to have the time to work on it=2E

What is missing for your R-b, Daniel?

Bernhard
