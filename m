Yes, please, a thorough review would be great. I'm really keen to improve
what needs to be improved and hopefully finish this.

Do you want me to resend this as v7 to make patchew to grab this series
for further review?

I understand your concerns. What exact issues do you have in mind?
Are these issues related to the input buffer handling, so technical issues?
Or issues with usability?

In multiplexing (not mixing) for the use-case that I am describing, there i=
s one
serious drawback: as soon as you switch the "focus" to another input device
(for example from vnc to socket chardev), you will not be able to switch ba=
ck
from the same input console - the input now works on another device. This l=
ooks
strange and does not add convenience to the final user. Perhaps, for a case
other than console, this would be reasonable, but for console input -
I would like
to keep the mixer option: the front-end receives input from both back-ends.

Do I need to add someone else in CC to gain more feedback?
