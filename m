Yep, this one is pretty much expected.

Right, and my understanding is all these facilities are already there, so
no new code should be needed on reconnect issues if to support cpr-transfer
in Libvirt or similar management layers that supports migrations.

I suppose that's also why I'm slightly confused on how cpr-exec can provide
benefit for mgmt layers yet so far with these open projects.  It might
affect Oracle's mgmt layers, but again I'm curious why Oracle does not
support these, because if that should support normal live migration, I
thought it should be needed to support changed ports on host etc..
