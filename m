I'm pretty sure purging can be enabled. Gitlab itself proposes this
with a "set up cleanup" link on the registry page (1).
Can you recall what issues they were experiencing?

If this is the only issue blocking Kaniko adoption, and we can't solve
it by enabling the cleanup, I can write an additional step at the end
of the container build to explicitly remove old cache tags.
