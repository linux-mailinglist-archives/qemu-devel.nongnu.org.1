Also gives you a chronological record of the log across all threads
if we have it in one file avoiding cross-correlation needs.

There is another trap door (or perhaps better described as back door).

qemu_log_trylock() returns the raw FILE * handle, which the callers
will directly write to. This is used instead of qemu_log() in a number
of places, and often has large data dumps written to it. This bypasses
any prefixes like timestamps, thread id, etc.  This direct FILE usage
would not map well over to tracing.

Also tracing wouldn't  allow qemu-user to provide its '-strace' CLI
arg, because we can't guarantee that QEMU is built with a trace
backend that will print to the console.

This makes it challenging (impossible) to entirely replace qemu_log
with tracing.


The other thing I find slightly wierd is 'info_report'. error vs
warning is clear - one is fatal, one is not, but the warning vs
info distinction is far from clearcut.

So warn_report vs info_report, also involves a choice of qemu_log(),
error_[v]printf(), fprintf(stderr, ...), g_printerr,  g_message,
g_critical, g_warning, g_info, and g_debug

... all of them are used somewhere in QEMU :-)

I feel like qemu_log ought to be obsoleted by glib's logging APIs,
but again we have the problem with the the raw FILE* usage for
large data dumps. Some glib APIs we use will already be using
glib's logging APIs, and we wire upa  custom backend for glib
to call into  info_report/warn_report/error_report, with glib's
DEBUG level squashed into info_report

With regards,
Daniel
