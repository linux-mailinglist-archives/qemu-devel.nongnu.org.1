I'm not clear if the complaint of the dangling pointer comes from the
host or from the guest env, but I think it is ok to continue if you've
been able to build the env.

Yes, you don't need to mess with pcie stuff so this solution is
totally valid. I think we need to change that part in the tutorial.

You cannot see the vDPA device from the guest. From the guest POV is a
regular virtio over PCI bus.

From the host, vdpa_sim is not a PCI device either, so you cannot see
under /sys/bus. Do you have a vdpa* entry under
/sys/bus/vdpa/devices/?

Did you install kernel-modules-internal?
