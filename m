Choosing interrupt id as an example of what we want to include was 
confusing, and brought more conversation than I expected.

I wanted to point that we may want different data per event, instead of 
talking specifically of interrupt or per architecture specific data.
To still answer you, I was thinking sharing interrupt number for x86_64, 
or interrupt id for aarch64. It's probably too naive, so let's drop this 
and move on :).

We can restrict to having from/to PCs for now. Mentioning interrupt id 
as example was a mistake.

Looks good. As said in previous message, we can drop the complex data 
type idea.

So we could have something like:

/* plugin side */
void on_cf_event(qemu_plugin_cf_event_type, uint64_t from, uint64_t to) {
    ...
}

/* API side */
void qemu_plugin_register_vcpu_syscall_cb(
qemu_plugin_id_t id, qemu_plugin_cf_event_type type, 
qemu_plugin_register_vcpu_cf_cb);

We thus would have a new callback type qemu_plugin_vcpu_cf_cb_t added.

For registering several events, we might define enum values for types 
indexed on every bit, so we can directly xor the enum to register 
several types. (same idea than existing qemu_plugin_mem_rw, but for more 
values, with a specific ALL value covering all possibilities).

Does that match what you were thinking?
