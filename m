I took some time to revisit the dependency issues with PDCM again, and I
do think the approach mentioned in previous reply should work.

Ok, let me pick your patch 1 & 2. I will rebase these on the CET series
(since I've also modified the dependency for Arch LBR). The entire
dependency fix series may take some time and may need to wait for
several weeks.

However, at least it's decoupled from the rest. :)

At the same time, I'll help go through the remaining patches 3-9 again,
as it's been quite a while since I last reviewed them.

Yes, I think so.

Yes, I think so, too. I understand that QEMU needs to ensure vmstate
migration compatibility.

Thanks,
