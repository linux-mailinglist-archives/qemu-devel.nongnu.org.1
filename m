If this is purely a debugging aid, we could make use of ELF notes to
just stick the config-host.h content into the binary. This has precedent
in systemd package notes (https://github.com/systemd/package-notes) and
is more clearly *NOT* an end user CLI option, nor a public API in QMP.

Querying is then

    objdump -j .note.qemu-config-h -s /usrbin/qemu-system-x86_64


With regards,
Daniel
