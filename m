The monitor is involved in so much as the socket_get_fd() method
is what internal QEMU code uses to resolve FD names into FD numbers.

The first thing it does is check whether the caller is runing in
the context of a monitor command. If so, it resolves FD names using
the monitor, otherwise it'll assume an FD has been passed in by the
parent process.  The latter codepath is the one we need to enhance
to use systemd named FDs. Essentially this latter codepath will only
run during initial QEMU startup, as at runtimne, all callers will
be in the context of the monitor.

In system/vl.c  the 'qemu_init' method takes care of system
startup - so at the very end of that method we should check
for unclaimed FDs.

Well that's their current impl, but conceptually it is interesting
to be able to listen on multiple sockets, so that machines with
multiple public facing IP addresses can be made to listen on a
selection of IPs, instead of the wildcard address, or a single
address. So it is an interesting facility to gain if it is easy.

It gets even more troublesome when we consider our long term direction
is to support JSON documents for command line args. The plain FD names
are a good decoupling of CLI syntax from the service manager.
