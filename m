My understanding so far is RDMA is sololy for performance but nothing else,
then it's a question on whether rdma existing users would like to do so if
it will run slower.

Jinpu mentioned on the explicit usages of ib verbs but I am just mostly
quotting that word as I don't really know such details:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/CAMGffEm2TWJxOPcNQTQ1Sjytf5395dBzTCMYiKRqfxDzJwSN6A@mail.gmail.com/

So not sure whether that applies here too, in that having qiochannel
wrapper may not allow direct access to those ib verbs.
