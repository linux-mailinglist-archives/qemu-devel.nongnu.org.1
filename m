Ok. it looks to be a static checking at the source. I'm sure there must be
a way to dynamically do the same by negotiating the features i.e. only
enabling the common subset at the destination. I quickly skimmed the
migration code and I cannot find any thing like this being done as of now.
And this problem looks to be a pandoras box to me.=20

Correct.

Yes, thanks.

I understand this part, as discussed above this is not relevant to this pat=
ch-set
as we are not adding CPU Hotplug specific VMSD. But yes, I take your point =
and
will add above suggested change in the following patches in the next Qemu C=
ycle.

Yes, I did that intentionally to increase the code reuse which usually is e=
ncouraged.
This reduces the amount of re-testing required. But yes, there is a con sid=
e as
well to this approach if not done properly i.e. any issues in the older cod=
e also
get propagated in the newer code.

Generally we bank upon FFS function to get the next bit and use bit shiftin=
g to
deal with this kind of logic efficiently.=20

Maybe I should have looked a this earlier. I've  missed to address this in =
V16.
Do you mean error_setg(&error_abort,....) kind of logic? it has been discou=
raged
in favor of assert() I think?

Can we live with this for now or do you want me to send V17 for this change=
?


Thanks
Salil.
