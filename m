I think I understand what is going on here.

This is a challenge to fix at qemu side because it is relying
on a bunch of old behavior.  For a while now legacy -drive parameters have =
been
split into parts that go in -drive and a separate -device entry
that covers the hardware - even with that though we'd need
to specify a bus as on arm64 the default for -drive is virtio-blk
which ends up I connected on the pcie bus.

Note this is just as broken if you use any pxb-pcie instances as
those have similar fixed assumption that you can only hang root ports
off them.

I think best solution is probably to stop use the old style

-drive file=3Droot.img,format=3Draw,media=3Ddisk

and switch to fully expanded virtio solution along the lines of

-drive if=3Dnone,file=3Droot.img,format=3Draw,media=3Ddisk,id=3Dhd \
-device virtio-blk,bus=3Dpcie.0,drive=3Dhd

which should be fine on x86 and arm64 + any other architectures we
support in the future and will always bring the disk up as an RCiEP
on the main pcie root complex.
