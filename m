Hi All (and Peter),

My name is Michael Galaxy (formerly Hines). Yes, I changed my last name 
(highly irregular for a male) and yes, that's my real last name: 
https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrgalaxy/)

I'm the original author of the RDMA implementation. I've been discussing 
with Yu Zhang for a little bit about potentially handing over 
maintainership of the codebase to his team.

I simply have zero access to RoCE or Infiniband hardware at all, 
unfortunately. so I've never been able to run tests or use what I wrote 
at work, and as all of you know, if you don't have a way to test 
something, then you can't maintain it.

Yu Zhang put a (very kind) proposal forward to me to ask the community 
if they feel comfortable training his team to maintain the codebase (and 
run tests) while they learn about it.

If you don't mind, I'd like to let him send over his (very detailed) 
proposal,

- Michael
