When the destination is started with '-S' (autostart=false), which is what
I think libvirt does, doesn't management only start the destination
after a certain useful event?
In other words, is there an event we already emit to say that the destination
has finished loading the postcopy devices, or could we just add that
event, so that management could just wait for that before issuing
the continue?
