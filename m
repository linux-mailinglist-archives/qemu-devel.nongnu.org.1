The idea to have mux-fe and mux-be (current implementation) was born to
distinguish what exactly we multiplex: front-ends or back-ends.

As Mark-Andre rightly noted, input from back-end devices is not multiplexed=
,
but rather mixed.

Overlay for me has a strong association with the filesystem concept. This
would work for me if combined back-end inputs function by layering one
on top of another, with potentially higher-priority inputs overriding
lower-priority ones. It implies a hierarchical or layered merging approach.
Not quite well describes a simple mixing strategy.

Replicator - this can be a good name from front-end device point of view:
suggests a mechanism for distributing the same input (front-end) to differe=
nt
destinations (back-ends).

Two more: what about 'aggregator' or even 'hub' ?
Also 'mixer'? So we have '-chardev mux' and '-chardev mix' (try not to get
confused :)
