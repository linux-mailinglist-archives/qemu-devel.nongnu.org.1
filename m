yes. Could you please rebase this series on upstream ?

It would be good to add tests for SMT. May be we could extend :

   tests/avocado/ppc_pseries.py

with a couple of extra QEMU configs adding 'threads=' (if possible) and
check :

   "CPU maps initialized for Y threads per core"

and

   "smp: Brought up 1 node, X*Y CPUs"

?

Thanks,

C.
