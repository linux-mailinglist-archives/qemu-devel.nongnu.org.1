Yes, I agree. Those are creative, and obviously not part of what the
LLM can produce with a pure "refactoring prompt". In that commit,
clearly, I hadn't made a strong attempt at splitting out new
functionality and refactoring; I might even do that now. :)

I agree with your reasoning that the commit goes beyond the "no
creative change" line, or at least parts of it do.

Inadvertently, this is also an example of how the policy helps AI
users follow our existing contribution standards.

Yes, a better approach would have been to change the initializer and
ask AI to do the mechanical parts. Something like, in a commit
message:

Note: after changing the initializer, the bulk of the changes were
done with the following prompt: "finish this conversion - i want to
track the PackageConfiguration object per machine, with pkg.cfg
becoming pkg.cfg[MachineChoice.HOST]".

Still, putting the two together follows the exception text encouraging
"to not mix AI- and human-written code in the same commit, *as much as
possible*". Again, this is just an example, and in practice the amount
of non-creative refactoring would be much larger than the rest.
