Yeah, to be clear, what I'm suggesting is that we should
not do that reshuffling, exactly because it is a lot of
work and it's not that important. Better to just fix the bug.

In general, yes, we should at least document this kind of
beartrap. The difficulty is finding some good place to do it
(there are two broad locations: in a doc comment on the
function(s) for "connect a qemu_irq", and in some more
general "how to do device/board stuff" place in docs/devel/).
Feel free to cc me on any patch you send about that.

I think you won't need the OR gate part -- I mentioned it just
for completeness.

That's fine -- since this is a bug fix we don't have to worry
about getting it in before softfreeze.
