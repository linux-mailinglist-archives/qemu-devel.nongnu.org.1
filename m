Looks like we made a mess.

Having the same command work differently on different targets is less
than ideal.  I'm sure there were reasons both for the initial s390x
design, and for x86-64 deviating from it later.  I'm not qualified to
debate this.

Regardless, actual behavior should match documented behavior.  If actual
behavior depends on the target, then documentation needs to explain that
in sufficient detail.

Could we get this fixed, please?
