Because we need to first get the flags before flipping the O_DIRECT
bit. And we do this once to enable and once to disable.

    int flags = fcntl(fioc->fd, F_GETFL);
    if (enabled) {
        flags |= O_DIRECT;
    } else {
        flags &= ~O_DIRECT;
    }
    fcntl(fioc->fd, F_SETFL, flags);

No, we may get an -EINVAL. See Daniel's reply.

Hm, sounds like a good idea. We'd need a place to put that new ioc
though. Either QEMUFile.direct_ioc and then make use of it in
qemu_put_buffer_at() or a more transparent QIOChannelFile.direct_fd that
gets set somewhere during file_start_outgoing_migration(). Let me try to
come up with something.
