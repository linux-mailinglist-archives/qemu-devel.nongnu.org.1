Well, if we decide we have reasons to introduce the "config" concept,
then I think we should not present two ways of doing the same
thing. User calls qmp_migrate with its arguments and that's the
migration. No other ways of setting parameters.

Since we do have parameters that are set in "runtime" I though of
keeping migrate-set-parameters around to minimize the interface
change. Maybe those should have been separate knobs on their own after
all... But in any case, we can't reject migrate-set-parameters because
it might happen way earlier than the actual migration command. So I
don't think anything changes regarding the API.

Makes sense. We'd say either use the old way or the new way. If both are
mixed, then the new way takes precedence. That keeps older apps working
and allows new code to transition into the new way.

I don't think other apps is the problem, but libvirt itself maybe
attempting two migrations in sequence after one of them fails.

There always the possibility that the user is poking around, which of
course is not advisable, but if a weird migration bug shows up it's
difficult to confirm that other app/user hasn't changed the parameters.

We can provide it, but I'd rather not unless we agree that is the way
forward. We don't need another way of doing the same as existing
commands.

I don't see it as breaking the old stuff. Because any old users would
still be using migrate-set-parameters as usual. So I think your concern
is about calling migrate the new way and also keeping -global
working. As I said, personally I don't mind if put some ifs around to
keep -global working.

Could we add another parameter that says allow-globals (or w/e) and make
everyone happy?
