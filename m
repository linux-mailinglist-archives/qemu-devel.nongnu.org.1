Thanks, note that it's not my request to have patch 2-3. :)  Please take
your own judgement.

Again, I'd run a round of perf (only if my patches can directly run through
without heavy debugging on top of yours), if nothing shows a benefit I'd go
with what you have right now, and we drop patch 2-3 - they're not justified
if they provide zero perf benefit.
