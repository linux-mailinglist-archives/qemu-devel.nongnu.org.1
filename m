I am calling the fact that embedded memory regions are accessible in 
instance_finalize() "live". A device can perform operations on its 
memory regions during instance_finalize() and we should be aware of that.

object_unparent() is such an example. instance_finalize() of a device 
can call object_unparent() for a subregion and for its container. If we 
automatically finalize the container when calling object_unparent() for 
the subregion, calling object_unparent() for its container will result 
in the second finalization, which is not good.
