Yes, hard to argue against it.

I still hope, Daniel will share his opinion..

 From our side, we are OK with any interface, which is accepted)


Let me summarize in short the variants I see:

===

1. lists

Add migrations parameters for such features:

migrate-inflight-region = [ list of QOM paths of vhost-user devices ]
backend-transfer = [ list of QOM paths of devices, which backend should be migrated ]

This way, we just need to set the same sets for source and target QEMU before migration,
and it have no relation to machine types.

PROS: Like any other migration-capability, setup what (and how) should migrate, no
relation to device properties and MT.

CONS: Logically, that's the same as add a device property, but instead we implement
lists of devices, and create extra QOM_PATH-links.

===

2. device parameters

Before migration we should loop through devices and call corresponding
qom-set commands, like

qom-set {path: QOM_PATH, property: "backend-transfer", "value": true}
qom-set {path: QOM_PATH, property: "migrate-inflight-region", "value": true}

And of course, we should care to set same values for corresponding devices on source
and target.

In this case, we also _can_ rely on machine types for defaults.

Note, that "migrate-inflight-region" may become the default in the 11.0 MT.
But backend-transfer can't be a default, as this way we'll break remote migration.

PROS: No lists, native properties

CONS: These properties does not define any portion of device state, internal or
visible to guest. It's not a property of device, but it's and option for migration
of that device.

===

2.1 = [2] assisted by one boolean migration-parameter

Still, if we want make backend-transfer "a kind of" default, we'll need one boolean
migration parameter "it-is-local-migration", and modify logic to

really_do_backend_transfer = it-is-local-migration and device.backend-transfer
really_do_migrate_inflight_region = not it-is-local-migration and device.migrate-inflight-region

PROS: starting from some MT, we'll have good defaults, so that user don't have
to enable/disable the option per device for every migration.

CONS: a precedent of the behavior driven by combination of device property and
corresponding migration parameter (or we have something similar?)

===

4. mixed

Keep [2] for this series, and [1] for backend-transfer.

PROS: list for backend-transfer remains "the only exclusion" instead of "the practice",
so we will not have tons of such lists :)

CONS: inconstant solutions for similar things

===

5. implement "per device" migration parameters

They may be set by additional QMP command qmp-migrate-set-device-parameters, which
will take additional qom-path parameter.

Or, we may add one list of structures like

[{
    qom_path: ...
    parameters: ..
}, ...]

into common migration parameters.

PROS: keep new features as a property of migration, but avoid several lists of QOM paths
CONS: ?

Hmm, we also may select devices not only by qom_path, but by type, for example, to enable
feature for all virtio-net devices. Hmm, and this type may be also used as discriminator
for parameters, which may be a QAPI union type..

What do you mean by probing device features? Isn't it qom-get command?
