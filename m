This series is the remaining patches not yet applied from my "arm:
Drop deprecated boards" series; this is essentially the device
removals which didn't get review in that series and/or which had some
discussion about whether we should remove them.

To summarise the remaining removals:

 * max1110 and max1111 are SSI devices so in theory could be
   created by users on the command line. However I found no
   evidence of doing this when I did a web search for
   "device max1110", and the utility of doing so is unclear
   to me since it's not possible for the command line device
   to have its ADC inputs or its interrupt line output
   wired up to anything.
 * max7310 is an I2C GPIO controller, so it has the same
   "in theory a user could create this on the command line
   but in practice it's pretty useless because there's no
   way to wire up the GPIO lines to anything" status.
 * the microdrive device can only be used with our PCMCIA
   bus emulation, and we no longer have any boards using
   that, so I think these are uncontroversially deleteable.
   Some boards we still have should in theory have a
   PCMCIA controller (strongarm, kzm, sh7750), but we don't
   model those controllers and none of those boards are
   sufficiently interesting or active that it's likely
   anybody will ever add one.
 * The ECC code is entirely unused now; this is an
   uncontroversial removal of dead code, and I only didn't
   put it in my pullreq because it wasn't reviewed yet.
 * Consensus on the v1 series was that we could get rid of
   -portrait/-rotate even though in theory you could use
   them on a non-pxa2xx machine type to achieve the odd
   effect of rotating mouse input. I've added a section
   to removed-features.rst about this and beefed up the
   patch commit message.

Of these, I think we should definitely be dropping microdrive,
pcmcia, ecc, and the portrait/rotate options, and I didn't hear any
dissenting opinions on v1.

For max111x and max7310: these are fairly small (a couple of hundred
lines each) and not too badly behind the curve for code quality/API
usage (in particular they're both QOM devices), so I could fairly
easily be persuaded that they should stay.  However I would like in
that case to see:

 (a) what's the use case/user ? (e.g. examples of "I'm
     actually using this on the command line, like this"
     or "I'm using this in the machine model I plan to submit
     in the next six months")
 (b) some kind of testing of them (which we can write
     based on the answer to a.)

thanks
