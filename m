That would be a nice alternative because it maps NULL to something, just
like the actual stream does. NULL -> '0' in the stream, NULL -> nullptr
in the JSON. I'll give it a try, thanks.

Right, it's just that a larger data type allows for a more unique
marker, which can be detected more reliably by the consumers of the
stream. The smaller data type is too ambiguous.

Yes, the script is just presenting the data, we can use what's more
informative.
