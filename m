Sorry for the delay, I have been heads down preparing a new series.

No, IMO they do not need to know the full spelling of the acronym to use the
functionality.  It is spelled out in a few places now.  It could be spelled
out in more places in the future.

Correct.

They are entangled problems.

* cpr state must loaded before backends are created
* monitor must be created after backends are created
   (because the chardevs that define a monitor are backends).
* migrate-incoming must come after the monitor is created
==> migrate-incoming cannot specify the cpr-state channel

This restriction is unlikely to change any time soon, if ever.
I have documented it as is, without speculating about future state.
If users do not like it they can request changes.

I have appreciated all your feedback and made many changes, and it has made
the code and documentation better.  Thanks for that. But right now, the V9
patches are queued, pass CI, and are ready to roll. I would hope at this point
that no one would consider "old QEMU" vs "the old QEMU" to be a showstopper
that requires new patches to be posted.
