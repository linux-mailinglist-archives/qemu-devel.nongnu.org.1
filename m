Agreed, when I say an exception a tool, I would find it highly
unlikely we would do so for such a highly generic tool as
Claude/ChatGPT. That would effectively be removing all policy
limitations.

Rather I was thinking about the possibility that certain very
specialized tools might appear.

The usage scenarios exception seems the much more likely one
in the near future.

When a maintainer gives an Acked-by or Signed-off-by tag they
are stating the contribution complies with our policies and
that includes this AI policy.

If a maintainer isn't comfortable with the AI exception
applicability they should not give Acked-by/Signed-off-by,
and/or ask another maintainer to give their own NNN-by tag
as a second opinion.

Yes, I don't want to see us advertizing commercial products in
git history

Employees likely don't have any way to check that either. They'll
just be blindly trusting what little information their employer
provides, if any. We don't want to put our contributions into an
impossible situation wrt determining compliance. It needs to be
practical for them to make a judgement call.

Daniel
