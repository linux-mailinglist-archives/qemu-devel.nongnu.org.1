No, this is wrong. A mgmt application or user will have made a decision
about *how* it wants QEMU to configure a particular feature. QEMU must
always honour the mgmt application's request, and not try to do something
different.

If the mgmt app did not want the FDs to be used, it would not have
passed them to QEMU in the first place. Ignoring the FDs is not likely
to work, because QEMU is unlikely to have permission to open the FDs
itself.

Ignoring the errors when creating the FDs, makes it much much harder
to detect and diagnose deployment problems, because the root cause
error is being discarded, and replaced by a later error which misleads
the app managing QEMU.

Always honouring the user requested config, or giving an error back
when it fails, is standard QEMU practice.

With regards,
Daniel
