Previous discussion [0].

Changes in v2:
* Split the big patch moving the drain outside of
  bdrv_change_aio_context(), mark functions along the way with graph
  lock annotations.
* In {internal,external}_snapshot_action, check that associated bs did
  not change after drain and re-acquiring the lock.
* Improve error handling using goto where appropriate.
* Add bdrv_graph_wrlock_drained() convenience wrapper rather than
  adding a flag argument.
* Don't use atomics to access bs->quiesce_counter field, add a patch
  to adapt the two existing places that used atomics.
* Re-use 'top' image for graph-changes-while-io test case and rename
  the other image to 'mid'. Remove the image files after the test.
* Use "must be" instead of "needs to be" in documentation, use single
  line comments where possible.
* Remove yet another outdated comment.
* I did not add Kevin's R-b for the patch marking bdrv_drained_begin()
  GRAPH_RDLOCK, as the earlier patches/preconditions changed.

This series is an attempt to fix a deadlock issue reported by Andrey
here [1].

bdrv_drained_begin() polls and is not allowed to be called with the
block graph lock held. Mark the function as GRAPH_UNLOCKED.

This alone does not catch the issue reported by Andrey, because there
is a bdrv_graph_rdunlock_main_loop() before bdrv_drained_begin() in
the function bdrv_change_aio_context(). That unlock is of course
ineffective if the exclusive lock is held, but it prevents TSA from
finding the issue.

Thus the bdrv_drained_begin() call from inside
bdrv_change_aio_context() needs to be moved up the call stack before
acquiring the locks. This is the bulk of the series.

Granular draining is not trivially possible, because many of the
affected functions can recursively call themselves.

In place where bdrv_drained_begin() calls were removed, assertions
are added, checking the quiesced_counter to ensure that the nodes
already got drained further up in the call stack.

NOTE:
there are pre-existing test failures on current master, e.g. '240' for
all formats, '295 296 inactive-node-nbd luks-detached-header' for luks
and 'mirror-sparse' for raw. For me, the failures do not change after
this series.
