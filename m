Maybe 'max-multi-conn-clients', since it is something that even if the
user sets it to larger than 1 but the server doesn't advertise the
bit, then we silently restrict to one client.

Okay, I'll make sure to warn if it exceeds the compile-time max.

Here, I disagree.  But that's where better naming comes into play: if
there is 'max-' in the name, then the user should not be surprised if
they don't actually achieve the max (because the server lacked
support).  On the other hand, I could see how you might want to know
if you have a mismatched setup ("I think the server SHOULD be
supporting multi-conn, so I request multiple clients, and I want to be
informed if my expectations were not met because then I know to go
reconfigure the server").  Thoughts?
