the common commitment is at least keeping backwards compatibility.

You introduce a user-visible change that people need to use 
"-kvmclock,-kvmclock2" to totally disable kvmclock.

The only difference between kvmclock and kvmclock2 is the MSR index. And 
from users' perspective, they don't care this difference. The existing 
usage is simple. When I want kvmclock, use "+kvmclock". When I don't 
want it, use "-kvmclock".

You are complicating things and I don't see a strong reason that we have 
to do it.
