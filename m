Dah, I forgot to update this comments... this is v12, addressing
your review from v11 - and sent with my venerable mailbomb script
that doesn't mangle patches.

I rebased today in the top of current upstream. So far, no
conflicts, but as it touches DSDT table and backward-compatible
logic, it is still wise to have it applied earlier than later.
