Yes.  I mentioned this fallback below.

It rules out known bad, but not "maybe terribly bad, we just don't
know".

Yes.

By the way, two booleans is a rather awkward encoding of three states.
What about require-secure=3Dyes/no/feeling-lucky?  We may want something
better than feeling-lucky, it's merely the first one that crossed my
mind :)

Annotating something as known insecure has value, but we can do that
even with just one flag:

    .secure =3D true;

means "declared secure",

    .secure =3D false;

means "declared insecure", and nothing means "undecided".

Initializing .secure =3D false doesn't *do* anything (false is the
default), but it would still be a fine way to annotate.

Do you mean no new burden?
