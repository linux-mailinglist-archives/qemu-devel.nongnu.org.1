Ok, that makes sense. Can we be sure that requests are handled in the
order they were submitted, though? That is, if the failed request is
resubmitted, could the already pending next one still succeed if it's
overtaken by the resubmitted request? Not sure if this would even cause
a probem, but is it a case we have to consider?
