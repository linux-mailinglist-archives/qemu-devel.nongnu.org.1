I view it as "risky" in two ways

 - this device makes it very easy for a user to shoot themselves in
   the foot
 - we dont want to have to think about compatibility across QEMU
   releases in case there is something peculiar about a particular
   device type.

IMHO, adding the 'x-' prefix and disclaiming full support is sufficient
mitigation.

I agree.
