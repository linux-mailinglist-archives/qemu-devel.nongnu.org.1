I always wanted to be an archaeologist:

https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel//2012-08/msg01136.html

I was expecting to find some complicated chain of events leading to the
choice of using a coroutine, but no.

Which are then fine because the work itself runs on the main loop,
right? So the bottom-half scheduling could be left as a coroutine.
