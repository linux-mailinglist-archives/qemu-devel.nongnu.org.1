Hi Michael,

Thanks for confirming that the use case seems reasonable=2E

For now, we'd like to sharpen the term "virtualization use case" to allow =
for KVM to be usable in machines that aren't inside the security boundary a=
nd where maintenance commitment is unrealistic=2E The current approach is t=
o adjust the policy and to spell out the machines where these commitments a=
re made=2E

The trigger for this RFC was to be able to add KVM support to the imx8mp-e=
vk machine=2E I have it working but can't currently upstream it due to our =
policy=2E It asks for unreasonable work and commitment which adds an unjust=
ifyable burden on the maintainers=2E

I do see a need for further enhancements on the broader topic like adding =
a -virt switch etc=2E Maybe we should come up with a different term than "v=
irtualization use case" which appears to leave a lot of room for interpreta=
tion=2E I propose these topics to be addressed separately=2E

What is missing for your R-b?

Thanks,
Bernhard
