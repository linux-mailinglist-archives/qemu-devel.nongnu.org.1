On POSIX, thread naming uses pthread_setname_np(), which is a GNU
extension.  Can't see drawbacks; just use it when available.

On Windows, thread naming appears to use a dynamically loaded
SetThreadDescription().  Any drawbacks?  I'm a Windows ignoramus...

Yes, that's out of the question.  We can debate backtrace on internal
errors, such as hitting &error_abort, or more generally abort().  Need
to demonstrate it adds value to simply dumping core, which we get for
free.

This would be a best effort.  The program is already out of order, and
printing may or may not work.  Avoiding printf() and memory allocation
would improve the odds.

1. Core dumps may take disk space!  Let's disable them.

2. My programs crash!  I need to know why.

3. I know!  Let's make all the program bigger!

SCNR ;)
