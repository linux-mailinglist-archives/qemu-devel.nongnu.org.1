In traditional C, I would agree with you that mid-function 'return's
are often a bad idea, because they complicate free'ing of memory and
tend to actively encourage memory/resource leaks.

With our adoption of g_auto/g_autofree, that problem has been
eliminated across a decently large subset of code. This swings
the balance so that having mid-function 'return's often (but not
always) results in shorter & easier to understand code, with few
leak possiblities, provided g_auto/autofree is sufficient to deal
with all cleanup needs.

There will still be cases where it makes more sense to use 'goto'
for cleanup, since g_auto/autofree is sufficient in all scenarios.

Thus I don't think we should have a rule that strictly dictates
either way. Better to leave it upto author's judgement call as to
which approach results in clearer code for each particular function.
I would still encourage maximising use of 'g_auto/autofree' where
practical.

With regards,
Daniel
