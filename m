Passing plain files to QEMU is a new feature, so apps have to
adapt their code already. The expectations around flags are
not especially hard - RDONLY|WRONLY|RDWR, optionally with
O_DIRECT depending on what migrate feature is enabled.

Having multiple fdsets should "just work" - qemu_open() handles everything
behind the scenes, so the rest of QEMU shouldn't need to know anything
about FD passing of plain files.

Similarly for socket FD passing, if the QEMU code works with a
SocketAddress struct in its public API, FD passing of of sockets
should again "just work" without any special logic.

The only reason why 'migrate' has this "fd:name" protocol, is because
this pre-dates the introduction of "SocketAddress" in QAPI.

With the switch to "MigrateAddress" exposing "SocketAddress" directly,
'migrate' has normalized itself with best practice.
