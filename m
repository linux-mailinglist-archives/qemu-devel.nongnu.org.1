Migration needn't to be the blocker necessarily. For those states of vCPUs, which
have been instantiated and not realized yet, those states can be moved around to
be managed under another migratable object (e.g. MachineState). In this way, those
vCPU states can be migrated together with MachineState. However, it sounds strange
to me to have vCPU objects instantiated, but unrealized until hot-add is triggered.
It's not what QOM supposes to support.

Ok, I don't realize x86 also follows this model: instantiate hotpluggable vCPUs
and destroy them on bootup.

My question has been parsed in a wrong way. My question was if it's doable to avoid
instantiating vCPU#1 on bootup when we have command lines '-cpu host -smp cpus=1,max_cpus=2'
and release it in machvirt_init(). Instead, ms->possible_cpus->cpus[] are reused to create
GICv3 and vCPU file descriptors. It looks like a clean way at least. There may be significant
efforts to reuse mc->possible_cpus->cpus[], but vCPU#1 object has ephemeral life cycle.
It looks unnecessary to create the ephemeral vCPU#1 object.

Thanks,
Gavin
