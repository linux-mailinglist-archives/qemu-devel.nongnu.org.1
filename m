Hi Bernd,
QEMU quiesces I/O at certain points, like when the block driver graph is
reconfigured (kind of like changing the device-mapper table in the
kernel) or when threads are reconfigured. This is also used during
termination to stop accepting new I/O and wait until in-flight I/O has
completed.

Ideally io_uring's ASYNC_CANCEL would work on in-flight
FUSE-over-io_uring uring_cmd requests. The REGISTER or COMMIT_AND_FETCH
uring_cmds would complete with -ECANCELED and future FUSE requests would
be queued in the kernel until FUSE-over-io_uring becomes ready again.

If and when userspace becomes ready again, it submits REGISTER
uring_cmds again and queued FUSE requests are then delivered to
userspace.

Thanks for your help!

Stefan
