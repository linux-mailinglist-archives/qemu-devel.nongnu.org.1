Indeed the current code is kind of tricky and may need better
documentation. But the problem is some features were datapath related
and they are supported since the birth of a specific vhost device. For
example, some GSO related features (actually, it's not a feature of
vhost-net but TUN/TAP).

And I've found another interesting thing, for RING_REST, actually we
don't need to do anything but we have the following commits:

313389be06ff6 ("vhost-net: support VIRTIO_F_RING_RESET")
2a3552baafb ("vhost: vhost-kernel: enable vq reset feature")

Technically, they are not necessary as RING_RESET for vhost-kernel
doesn't require any additional new ioctls. But it's too late to change
as the kernel commit has been merged.

Another issue is that it seems to require a change of the semantic of
VHOST_GET_FEATURES. If my understanding is true, it seems a
non-trivial change which I'm not sure it's worth to bother.

Thanks
