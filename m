Peter, thanks for review! Will work on splitting this up a bit to =
support the plumbing you mentioned KVM does today on ARM.=20

Spot on, yes. We default to a lower (36 bit) IPA space always, and =
expose the knobs starting in 13 to raise this on a per-VM
basis. We aren=E2=80=99t raising it today so we=E2=80=99d always fail =
when the kernel gets a hv_vm_map with an IPA past the end of our address
space.

>=20

Spot on again. We didn=E2=80=99t want to advertise a larger PA range to =
the guest than what is actually backing the VM, so for a =E2=80=9Ccorrect=E2=
=80=9D world
macOS 15 would be required. You=E2=80=99d get 40 bits of IPA space, and =
we finally line up with a valid ARM PARange value. As for whether
there=E2=80=99s a list of what SoC=E2=80=99s support what IPA size, I =
don=E2=80=99t believe so. All of the pro/max SoC=E2=80=99s do iirc, but =
I=E2=80=99d just direct folks to write a
program that calls `hv_vm_config_get_max_ipa_size` to confirm. There=E2=80=
=99s `sysctl -a kern.hv`, but I=E2=80=99d avoid recommending this in =
case
the hv API does some extra munging with the value this reports. That =
hv_vm_config_ API should truly be the source of truth on any given
machine.

As for the error message we report, I=E2=80=99d have to remember what =
the error message is today, but it seemed somewhat reasonable after this =
patch
if I recall. It was in a codepath that already existed (and was added =
for kvm it seemed) and was checking if any part of the memory map =
exceeded the
maximum IPA size.

That=E2=80=99s perfectly fine, I=E2=80=99ll try and see how the plumbing =
was done for KVM and try and emulate where it makes sense
for HVF. Agree though, that=E2=80=99d definitely push this into =
multi-patch territory. Curious if you think what=E2=80=99s here today =
should
be multiple patches or the current work seems fine in one?
