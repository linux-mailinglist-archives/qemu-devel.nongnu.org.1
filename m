I'm somewhat conflating QMP & QAPI in my previous message too.

Yeah, patch review on new additions is primary amount and work
and indeed the bit we actually do want to be investing most
time in, as API modelling is a hard problem that needs careful
review.

As well as the developer & reviewer man hours cost from creatnig
such language bindings, there's also the negative impact of
potential developers being discouraged from interacting with QEMU
precisely to avoid taking on this man hours cost. Impossible to
quantify, as we can't measure how many projects haven't even been
started, due to such avoidance. This hidden cost of discouragement
is where I think the value of using standard protocols wins out
the most.

The big one is Python, which we should have done years ago, since
we use it widely in our own test suites.

Over time QEMU is widely used enough though, that it would be
conceptually useful for many other non-niche languages to have
formal APIs for talking to QEMU, but not compelling enough to
justify manually writing such APIs or code generators ourselves.

Yeah, schema conversion.

This is the really hard to answer question, as the calculating value of
a conversion relies on predicting an unknowable future. It is right to
be sceptical about the value of changing, but also worth thinking about
it none the less.

Its probably the kind of project that someone who doesn't have to justify
their time would do as an experiment in a fork of QEMU for a while to
see how it actually works out.

With regards,
Daniel
