I can see both sides of this one -- the semihosting spec
is pretty old and was designed (to the extent it was designed)
back in an era when 2GB of RAM or a 2GB file was pretty
implausible sounding. (And today there's not much appetite
for making updates to it for AArch32, because 32-bit is
the past, not the future, and in any case you have to deal
with all the existing implementations of the spec so
changes are super painful to try to promulgate.)

Our QEMU implementation of SYS_ISERROR() says "anything that's
a negative 32-bit integer is an error number" for 32-bit hosts,
which I suppose you might count on the side of "check
against INT32_MAX".

I think overall that if we think that anybody is or might be
using semihosting with files in that 2..4GB size, we should
err on the side of preserving that functionality. Otherwise
somebody will report it as a bug and we'll want to fix it
as a regression. And it doesn't seem impossible that somebody
out there is doing so.

If we report 2..4GB file sizes as if the file size value
was an unsigned integer, then clients that expect that will
work, and clients that treat any negative 32-bit value as
an error will also work in the sense that they'll handle it
as an error in the same way they would have done for -1.
So that is the safest approach from a back-compat point
of view, and I think that's what I lean towards doing.

thanks
