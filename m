I wrongly assumed it waits for RCU, but I found it is not true.

It is still not true that any guest access will trigger a fault to the 
guest. QEMU's internal AddressSpace keeps the old FlatView until the RCU 
changes, and some device may still have a DMA mapping.

Complexity is not a problem here. Any concurrent code has complexity 
needed for correctness and reliability. We should add complexity if 
needed for reliablity; otherwise, we should remove it (even if it's 
already simple).

The problem is that RCU doesn't free the memory region when all commands 
are blocked.

If we fix RCU, RCU will free the memory region, the virgl resource will 
be freed then, and the commands will be unblocked.

Not a test case that runs on the guest, but adding the following change 
to QEMU will demonstrate the issue:

diff --git a/hw/display/virtio-gpu-virgl.c b/hw/display/virtio-gpu-virgl.c
index 145a0b387956..c97cd2dfd7b3 100644

          memory_region_set_enabled(mr, false);
          memory_region_del_subregion(&b->hostmem, mr);
+        memory_region_ref(OBJECT(mr));
+        int k = b->renderer_blocked;
          object_unparent(OBJECT(mr));
+        assert(k == b->renderer_blocked);
+        memory_region_unref(OBJECT(mr));
      }

      return 0;

memory_region_ref() and memory_region_unref() emulates the begin and end 
of a DMA operation on mr, respectively. In a real world scenario, 
address_space_map() and address_space_unmap() call these functions.

If the code is correct, object_unparent() should not free the memory 
region while the DMA operation is ongoing, so the renderer will be kept 
blocked. assert(k == b->renderer_blocked) checks that.

My proposal is to limit the impact of the regression as possible as we 
can and to document it, not to postpone the solution until figuring out 
the problem in RCU.

UAF also results in DoS, and it can have a bigger consequence due to 
memory corruption. Memory leak is usually safer than UAF.

The question is whether memory leak causes a practical problem; it makes 
sense to opt to UAF if the accumulation happens too quickly; we at least 
know that UAF is rare.
