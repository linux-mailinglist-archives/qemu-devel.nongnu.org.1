It should be clear *why* something is marked x- - something that's
marked 'x-' because the feature is still in development is expected to shake
out at some point, and the interface designed so it can.
(and at some point the developer should get a prod to be asked whethere the
x- can be removed).
That's different from it permenantly being x- because it's expected to
change as the needs of the people debugging change.
