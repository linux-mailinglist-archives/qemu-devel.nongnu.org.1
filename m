AFAUI, I think Philippe meant something more like a generic OPT block
model, hw/block/otp.c, which would implement the low level storage
primitives of an OTP device. This model would then be used by the
Aspeed SBC model, providing the SW/HW interface, and possibly also
used by other models, such as the NPCM7xxOTPState, BCM2835OTPState,
and SiFiveUOTPState models.

Anyhow, separating the layers is a good idea :
   - OTP like device
   - Aspeed SBC interface
   - machine/SoC interface to define the backend.
   - and a doc update !
   - possibly a (functional) test case


Thanks,

C.
