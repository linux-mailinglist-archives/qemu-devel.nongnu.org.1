This doesn't feel obvious to me at all. A machine type defines what
hardware the guest sees. Guest hardware is essentially qdev.

I don't see any reasons why a backend should be interested in what guest
hardware looks like, that would seem like a bad layering violation. Many
backends can even exist without a guest at all, and are also used in
tools like qemu-storage-daemon. Having a machine type in a tool that
doesn't run a guest doesn't make any sense.

So if we do introduce some mechanism to provide different defaults for
compatibility with older versions, it has to be separate from machine
types.

Maybe it would make most sense to address this on the QAPI level then
and finally fully QAPIfy the command line. Adding defaults to the QAPI
schema is something that has come up again and again, so maybe we could
introduce that and do it in a versioned way from the start.
