Happens for me with emulated CXL memory. I think the case I saw
was split descriptors in virtio via address space caches
https://elixir.bootlin.com/qemu/latest/source/hw/virtio/virtio.c#L4043

One bounce buffer is in use for the outer loop and another for the descriptors
it is pointing to.

Matthias' series makes this work fine.  I need to circle back and check
how big a cache this needs.  I'm carrying a silly size because of the
side effect of the address space bug here
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20240215142817.1904-1-Jonathan.Cameron@huawei.com/#t
and can probably set it to much less than my currently 1GiB.
