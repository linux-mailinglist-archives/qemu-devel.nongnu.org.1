None of those are reasons to bypass the deprecation process.

As annoying as the current design is, we've released it and it
is subject to our usual QAPI stability promise.

The deprecation of the feature is sufficient warning for anyone who
might contemplate using it, to either decide to NOT use it, or to
tell us why we should keep it.
