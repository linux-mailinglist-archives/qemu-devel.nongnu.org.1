If we could make it clearer that we are operating on RAM_PREALLOC 
MRs/RAMBlocks in when handling shmem_map/shmem_unmap requests somehow, 
that would already take quite some magic out of this code. :)

Having that said, I now understand why you want RAM_PREALLOC, because 
you might only activate/deactivate some parts within a RAMBlock.
