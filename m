vm-memory is a very rigid API unfortunately. It's excellent for
rust-vmm purposes. I presume it's possible to figure out a clever
solution to satisfy both rust-vmm and QEMU use needs but I'm not sure
it's worth it. It's really hard to retrofit other projects into
vm-memory if they don't use rust-vmm crates API design and it might
make both rust-vmm code and QEMU code more complex. QEMU would depend
on rust-vmm architectural decisions and vice-versa. The thing I'm
fearing most is needing to refactor memory APIs in QEMU in the future
and turn the vm-memory dependency into technical debt.

Perhaps it's more sensible to not use external dependencies to wrap
over our APIs but we can surely design our Rust bindings inspired by
them. I think it's an inescapable consequence of QEMU's internals
being fluid over time and "private"/unstable.

Personal anecdote: I tried using vm-memory on a personal TCG-like
emulator I am writing for fun, and I found it a daunting task as new
rust-vmm concepts appeared into my codebase as "scope creep". And I
wasn't even adapting an existing API to vm-memory, but designing a new
one based on it. I gave it up after a few days.
