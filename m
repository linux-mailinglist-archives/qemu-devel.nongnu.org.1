Even if we want to allow developers to rename binaries, we don't have to
allow an arbitrary choice of naming. We could define an accepted pattern
for naming that people must follow.

eg we could allow for clearly distinguished suffixes (ie append '-SUFFIX')
so that

  qemu-system-x86_64-fishfood

is acceptable while

  qemu-system-fishfood
  qemu-system-x86_64fishfood

would be an unsupported scenarios.

With regards,
Daniel
