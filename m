I can get behind this argument.

For this patch I'll just remove the redundant !kvm_enabled() check in kvm_riscv_reset_vcpu().
Let's keep the kvm_riscv_reset_vcpu() call at the end of riscv_cpu_reset_hold() to keep
the design where we have a single reset procedure, overwriting the needed state where
we want KVM to be the authority instead of QEMU.
