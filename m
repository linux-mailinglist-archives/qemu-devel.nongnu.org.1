Doesn't this discussion contradict the necessity of point 1? If I'm
understanding things correctly, it is valid for virtio device A to
refer to a structure in virtio device B's shared memory region by
absolute guest physical address. At least there is nothing in the spec
about resolving shmid values among different virtio devices, so
absolute guest physical addresses is the only way this sharing can be
done. And if it's valid for a pointer to a structure in a shared
memory region to exist, it's not clear to me why you can't have
pointers within a shared memory region.

It definitely makes sense that setting up a mapping should be done
with offsets. But unless a shared memory region can be dynamically
reallocated at runtime, then it doesn't seem necessary to ban pointers
within a shared memory region.
