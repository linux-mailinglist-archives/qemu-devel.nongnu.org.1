Yes, we do.

I like the idea.

We have a long list of configuration choices that might / are known to
punch holes into security boundaries.  Documenting them is entirely
inadequate; telling users who got p0wned it's their own fault for having
missed this particlar drop in the sea of QEMU documentation reminds me
of Douglas Adams' =E2=80=9CBeware of The Leopard=E2=80=9C.

And we don't have even that!  Just handwavy talk about a "virtualization
use case".

We can and should do better.

We should clearly document what "declared secure" actually means.
Here's my attempt at it: supported for use cases that require certain
security boundaries.

This isn't what users need.

This would be, if it covered everything accessible at the security
boundaries.  It doesn't for now: only QOM.

It might still be better than nothing.

However, it may well be unusable until enough of QOM is declared secure.

What would our advice to users be?  I'm afraid something complicated and
impermanent like "try require-secure=3Dyes, and if you can't make it work
because parts of QOM you can't do without are still undeclared, fall
back to prohibit-insecure=3Dyes, and be aware this avoids only some, but
not all security boundary death traps in either case."

This is an awful user interface.  But it's also a step towards the user
interface we want: a single, unchanging switch that ensures you're
running something that's fully supported for use cases that require
certain security boundaries.

A next step could be getting enough of QOM declared so we can move to a
single switch, with the (hopefully temporary) caveat about "only QOM".

We should clearly and prominently document the limitations at each step.

Not sure.  The guest boundary is just one of several security boundaries
listed in docs/system/security.rst.  Some of them aren't really about
the guest / the machine.

Maybe -compat?  It lets you exclude unstable or deprecated bits from the
user interface.  Feels similar to excluding insecure bits.

No idea, guess it's at worst a matter of shaving the yak?

I recommend qom-list-types.  Covers all of QOM, not just devices and
accelerators.

I lean towards all of QOM, no ifs, no buts.

I think this is the biggest gap.

Thanks for that!
