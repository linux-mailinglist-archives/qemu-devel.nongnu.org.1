EDK2 is only special here because it happens to be huge. If
we're going to not have "one single huge tarball" then the question
is "what should the split be?".

Yeah. I think we would still commit the compiled blobs to git;
this bullet point is more about "make it more reproducible
so anybody, or perhaps our CI system in an automated job,
can create the blobs to be committed".

One idea I think that was suggested in the meeting was that
we could make our build system say "if the blobs aren't present
locally, download the blob tarball the way we do for various other
dependencies we might download at build time". That would make
things "just work" for most people while maintaining the separation
of blobs and blob-sources from QEMU's actual sources.

But also notice this part -- if anybody wants to tackle the
problem they get to define it and also do requirements
collection...
