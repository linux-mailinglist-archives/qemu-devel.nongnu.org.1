Yes, I appreciate that!

Migration as a module outlives me working as a developer on QEMU.. so I can
only share my two cents that still resides in my memory, which may or may
not always be the truth..

I think one issue is migration used to error_report() things all over the
places, but then we thought it a good idea to try remember the error so
that libvirt can query at any time if necessary.  With that, starting from
QEMU 2.7 we introduced error-desc into query-migrate results.  That's what
s->error was about.

But then, could we drop the error_report() / error_report_err()s?  Likely
not, because there might be user relying on the printed errors to see what
happened..  Making query-migrate the only source of error report adds
complexity to those users and may cause confusions..  Hence the extra
references sometimes needed after migrate_set_error(), almost for keeping
behaviors to print it out as the old times (I didn't check each of them,
though).

Yes, I also agree qemu_savevm_state_setup() is confusing on error
handlings.  I'll comment below.

Hope above would provide some context.  In short, IMHO it's a mixture
demand of "print the error immediately like the old behavior" and "remember
the error too when query".

Correct.  It's once again legacy of migration code where it used to set
error onto fds (e.g. that'll start to fail all qemufile APIs on this fd,
and qemufile API is not well designed IMHO.. which is another story), but
then we start to have string-based Errors and I guess we didn't try harder
to unify both.

IIUC some people prefer such way so the function returns at a single point
(easier to add common cleanup codes, for example).  But I'd confess I also
prefer a direct return. :)

IIUC migrate_set_error() above was redundant instead, because
qemu_savevm_state_setup()'s caller will do migrate_set_error().

Said that, we shouldn't need to randomly call qemu_file_set_error() either
deep in this function.. may need some cleanups.

I don't think in this path ret can be >0..  but yeah this is pretty
unobvious even if true.  That's also why I liked QEMU's current preferences
of "bool fn(..., Error **errp)".. at least in new codes.  Maybe I should
ping Vladimir on his recent work here?

https://lore.kernel.org/r/20251028231347.194844-1-vsementsov@yandex-team.ru

That'll be part of such cleanup effort (and yes unfortunately many
migration related cleanups will need a lot of code churns...).

I think the clean way is we do not store anything when this function
provided Error**.

I'll see what I can do with this function.
