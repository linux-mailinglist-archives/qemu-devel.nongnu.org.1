See here:
https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/devel/submitting-a-patch.html#patch-emails-must-include-a-signed-off-by-line
and also the document linked from there:
http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/SubmittingPatches?id=f6f94e2ab1b33f0082ac22d71f66385a60d8157f#n297

As for getting the patch reviewed, it may be difficult as the USB 
maintainer is practically absent and has no time for QEMU for a while and 
as OHCI as you said is not odten used there aren't many people who could 
review it. Getting at least the formal stuff out of the way may help 
though to get somebody to try to review the patch.

BALATON Zoltan
