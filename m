I tried to make changelog consise and assume people reading that are 
familiar with QEMU so know what these options do. But whoever will update 
the changelog can decide if this is worth adding, I'm OK with that.

The QEMU doc specifically documents running Linux and Linux does not use 
or rely on NVRAM. But I could mention it there why you likely can't boot 
Linux with -kernel although if you try you'll get an error telling you and 
since the docs don't recommend that it's probably OK to not mention it 
just to not confuse people who only want to know what works.

I have my docs on AmigaOS and BBoot at qmiga.codeberg.page so I'll add 
info relating to these there and keep the QEMU docs for Linux. I've only 
mentioned BBoot in the changelog because people don't read docs so I 
wanted it to be everywhere so they see at least one of those before asking 
me. I've yet to update BBoot and my Qmiga pages but I'll do that for the 
QEMU release.
