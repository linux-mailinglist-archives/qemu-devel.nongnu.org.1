&gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; This patch set introduces virtual CPU hotplug support for the ARMv8 ar=
chitecture<br>
&gt; in QEMU. The idea is to be able to hotplug and hot-unplug vCPUs while =
the guest<br>
&gt; VM is running, without requiring a reboot. This does *not* make any as=
sumptions<br>
&gt; about the physical CPU hotplug availability within the host system but=
 rather<br>
&gt; tries to solve the problem at the virtualizer/QEMU layer. It introduce=
s ACPI CPU<br>
&gt; hotplug hooks and event handling to interface with the guest kernel, a=
nd code to<br>
&gt; initialize, plug, and unplug CPUs. No changes are required within the =
host<br>
&gt; kernel/KVM except the support of hypercall exit handling in the user-s=
pace/Qemu,<br>
&gt; which has recently been added to the kernel. Corresponding guest kerne=
l changes<br>
&gt; were posted on the mailing list [3] [4] by James Morse (ARM) and have =
been<br>
&gt; recently accepted and are now part of v6.11 mainline kernel.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; (III) Motivation<br>
&gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; This allows scaling the guest VM compute capacity on-demand, which wou=
ld be<br>
&gt; useful for the following example scenarios:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 1. Vertical Pod Autoscaling [9][10] in the cloud: Part of the orchestr=
ation<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0framework that could adjust resource requests (CPU and Mem=
 requests) for<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0the containers in a pod, based on usage.<br>
&gt; 2. Pay-as-you-grow Business Model: Infrastructure providers could allo=
cate and<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0restrict the total number of compute resources available t=
o the guest VM<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0according to the SLA (Service Level Agreement). VM owners =
could request more<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0compute to be hot-plugged for some cost.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; For example, Kata Container VM starts with a minimum amount of resourc=
es (i.e.,<br>
&gt; hotplug everything approach). Why?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 1. Allowing faster *boot time* and<br>
&gt; 2. Reduction in *memory footprint*<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Kata Container VM can boot with just 1 vCPU, and then later more vCPUs=
 can be<br>
&gt; hot-plugged as needed. Reducing the number of vCPUs in VM can in gener=
al<br>
&gt; reduce the boot times of the VM esepcially when number of cores are in=
creasing.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; **[UPCOMING]**<br>
&gt; I&#39;ve been working on enhancing the boot times of ARM/VMs using the=
 hotplug<br>
&gt; infrastructure proposed in this patch set. Stay tuned for upcoming pat=
ches that<br>
&gt; leverage this infrastructure to significantly reduce boot times for<br=
>
&gt; *non-hotplug* scenarios. Expect these updates in the next few weeks!<b=

&gt; <br>
&gt; A. Physical Limitation to Support CPU Hotplug: (Architectural Constrai=
nt)<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A01. ARMv8 CPU architecture does not support the concept of =
the physical CPU<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 hotplug. <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 a. There are many per-CPU components like PMU, SVE=
, MTE, Arch timers, etc.,<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0whose behavior needs to be clearly de=
fined when the CPU is<br>
&gt; hot(un)plugged. There is no specification for this.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A02. Other ARM components like GIC, etc., have not been desi=
gned to realize<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 physical CPU hotplug capability as of now. For exa=
mple,<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 a. Every physical CPU has a unique GICC (GIC CPU I=
nterface) by construct.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Architecture does not specify what CP=
U hot(un)plug would mean in<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0context to any of these.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 b. CPUs/GICC are physically connected to unique GI=
CR (GIC Redistributor).<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0GIC Redistributors are always part of=
 the always-on power domain. Hence,<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0they cannot be powered off as per spe=
cification.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; B. Impediments in Firmware/ACPI (Architectural Constraint)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A01. Firmware has to expose GICC, GICR, and other per-CPU fe=
atures like PMU,<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 SVE, MTE, Arch Timers, etc., to the OS. Due to the=
 architectural constraint<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 stated in section A1(a), all interrupt controller =
structures of<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 MADT describing GIC CPU Interfaces and the GIC Red=
istributors MUST be<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 presented by firmware to the OSPM during boot time=
.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A02. Architectures that support CPU hotplug can evaluate the=
 ACPI _MAT method to<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 get this kind of information from the firmware eve=
n after boot, and the<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 OSPM has the capability to process these. ARM kern=
el uses information in MADT<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 interrupt controller structures to identify the nu=
mber of present CPUs during<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 boot and hence does not allow to change these afte=
r boot. The number of<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 present CPUs cannot be changed. It is an architect=
ural constraint!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; C. Impediments in KVM to Support Virtual CPU Hotplug (Architectural Co=
nstraint)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A01. KVM VGIC:<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 a. Sizing of various VGIC resources like memory re=
gions, etc., related to<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0the redistributor happens only once a=
nd is fixed at the VM init time<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0and cannot be changed later after ini=
tialization has happened.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0KVM statically configures these resou=
rces based on the number of vCPUs<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0and the number/size of redistributor =
ranges.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 b. Association between vCPU and its VGIC redistrib=
utor is fixed at the<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0VM init time within the KVM, i.e., wh=
en redistributor iodevs gets<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0registered. VGIC does not allow to se=
tup/change this association<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0after VM initialization has happened.=
 Physically, every CPU/GICC is<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0uniquely connected with its redistrib=
utor, and there is no<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0architectural way to set this up.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A02. KVM vCPUs:<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 a. Lack of specification means destruction of KVM =
vCPUs does not exist as<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0there is no reference to tell what to=
 do with other per-vCPU<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0components like redistributors, arch =
timer, etc.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 b. In fact, KVM does not implement the destruction=
 of vCPUs for any<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0architecture. This is independent of =
whether the architecture<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0actually supports CPU Hotplug feature=
. For example, even for x86 KVM<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0does not implement the destruction of=
 vCPUs.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; D. Impediments in Qemu to Support Virtual CPU Hotplug (KVM Constraints=
-&gt;Arch)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A01. Qemu CPU Objects MUST be created to initialize all the =
Host KVM vCPUs to<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 overcome the KVM constraint. KVM vCPUs are created=
 and initialized when Qemu<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 CPU Objects are realized. But keeping the QOM CPU =
objects realized for<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 &#39;yet-to-be-plugged&#39; vCPUs can create probl=
ems when these new vCPUs shall<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 be plugged using device_add and a new QOM CPU obje=
ct shall be created.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A02. GICV3State and GICV3CPUState objects MUST be sized over=
 *possible vCPUs*<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 during VM init time while QOM GICV3 Object is real=
ized. This is because<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 KVM VGIC can only be initialized once during init =
time. But every<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 GICV3CPUState has an associated QOM CPU Object. La=
ter might correspond to<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 vCPU which are &#39;yet-to-be-plugged&#39; (unplug=
ged at init).<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A03. How should new QOM CPU objects be connected back to the=
 GICV3CPUState<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 objects and disconnected from it in case the CPU i=
s being hot(un)plugged?<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A04. How should &#39;unplugged&#39; or &#39;yet-to-be-plugge=
d&#39; vCPUs be represented in the<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 QOM for which KVM vCPU already exists? For example=
, whether to keep,<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0a. No QOM CPU objects Or<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0b. Unrealized CPU Objects<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A05. How should vCPU state be exposed via ACPI to the Guest?=
 Especially for<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 the unplugged/yet-to-be-plugged vCPUs whose CPU ob=
jects might not exist<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 within the QOM but the Guest always expects all po=
ssible vCPUs to be<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 identified as ACPI *present* during boot.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A06. How should Qemu expose GIC CPU interfaces for the unplu=
gged or<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 yet-to-be-plugged vCPUs using ACPI MADT Table to t=
he Guest?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; E. Summary of Approach ([+] Workarounds to problems in sections A, B, =
C &amp; D)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A01. At VM Init, pre-create all the possible vCPUs in the Ho=
st KVM i.e., even<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 for the vCPUs which are yet-to-be-plugged in Qemu =
but keep them in the<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 powered-off state.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A02. After the KVM vCPUs have been initialized in the Host, =
the KVM vCPU<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 objects corresponding to the unplugged/yet-to-be-p=
lugged vCPUs are parked<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 at the existing per-VM &quot;kvm_parked_vcpus&quot=
; list in Qemu. (similar to x86)<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A03. GICV3State and GICV3CPUState objects are sized over pos=
sible vCPUs during<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 VM init time i.e., when Qemu GIC is realized. This=
, in turn, sizes KVM VGIC<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 resources like memory regions, etc., related to th=
e redistributors with the<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 number of possible KVM vCPUs. This never changes a=
fter VM has initialized.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A04. Qemu CPU objects corresponding to unplugged/yet-to-be-p=
lugged vCPUs are<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 released post Host KVM CPU and GIC/VGIC initializa=
tion.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A05. Build ACPI MADT Table with the following updates:<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 a. Number of GIC CPU interface entries (=3Dpossibl=
e vCPUs)<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 b. Present Boot vCPU as MADT.GICC.Enabled=3D1 (Not=
 hot[un]pluggable) <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 c. Present hot(un)pluggable vCPUs as MADT.GICC.onl=
ine-capable=3D1=C2=A0 <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0- MADT.GICC.Enabled=3D0 (Mutually exc=
lusive) [6][7]<br>
&gt; - vCPU can be ACPI enabled+onlined after Guest boots (Firmware Policy)=
 <br>
&gt; - Some issues with above (details in later sections)<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A06. Expose below ACPI Status to Guest kernel:<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 a. Always _STA.Present=3D1 (all possible vCPUs)<br=
>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 b. _STA.Enabled=3D1 (plugged vCPUs)<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 c. _STA.Enabled=3D0 (unplugged vCPUs)<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A07. vCPU hotplug *realizes* new QOM CPU object. The followi=
ng happens:<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 a. Realizes, initializes QOM CPU Object &amp; spaw=
ns Qemu vCPU thread.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 b. Unparks the existing KVM vCPU (&quot;kvm_parked=
_vcpus&quot; list).<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0- Attaches to QOM CPU object.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 c. Reinitializes KVM vCPU in the Host.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0- Resets the core and sys regs, sets =
defaults, etc.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 d. Runs KVM vCPU (created with &quot;start-powered=
-off&quot;).<br>
&gt; - vCPU thread sleeps (waits for vCPU reset via PSCI). <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 e. Updates Qemu GIC.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0- Wires back IRQs related to this vCP=
U.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0- GICV3CPUState association with QOM =
CPU Object.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 f. Updates [6] ACPI _STA.Enabled=3D1.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 g. Notifies Guest about the new vCPU (via ACPI GED=
 interface).<br>
&gt; - Guest checks _STA.Enabled=3D1.<br>
&gt; - Guest adds processor (registers CPU with LDM) [3].<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 h. Plugs the QOM CPU object in the slot.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0- slot-number =3D cpu-index {socket, =
cluster, core, thread}.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 i. Guest online&#39;s vCPU (CPU_ON PSCI call over =
HVC/SMC).<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0- KVM exits HVC/SMC Hypercall [5] to =
Qemu (Policy Check).<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0- Qemu powers-on KVM vCPU in the Host=
.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A08. vCPU hot-unplug *unrealizes* QOM CPU Object. The follow=
ing happens:<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 a. Notifies Guest (via ACPI GED interface) vCPU ho=
t-unplug event.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0- Guest offline&#39;s vCPU (CPU_OFF P=
SCI call over HVC/SMC).<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 b. KVM exits HVC/SMC Hypercall [5] to Qemu (Policy=
 Check).<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0- Qemu powers-off the KVM vCPU in the=
 Host.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 c. Guest signals *Eject* vCPU to Qemu.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 d. Qemu updates [6] ACPI _STA.Enabled=3D0.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 e. Updates GIC.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0- Un-wires IRQs related to this vCPU.=
<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0- GICV3CPUState association with new =
QOM CPU Object is updated.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 f. Unplugs the vCPU.<br>
&gt; - Removes from slot.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0- Parks KVM vCPU (&quot;kvm_parked_vc=

&gt; - Destroys QOM CPU object.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 g. Guest checks ACPI _STA.Enabled=3D0.<br>

&gt; <br>
&gt; 1. HVF and qtest are not supported yet.<br>
&gt; 2. ACPI MADT Table flags [7] MADT.GICC.Enabled and MADT.GICC.online-ca=
pable are<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0mutually exclusive, i.e., as per the change [6], a vCPU ca=
nnot be both<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0GICC.Enabled and GICC.online-capable. This means:<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 [ Link: <a href=3D"https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/=
show_bug.cgi?id=3D3706" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://bugzil=
la.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3D3706</a> ]<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0a. If we have to support hot-unplug of the cold-booted vCP=
Us, then these MUST<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 be specified as GICC.online-capable in the MADT Ta=
ble during boot by the<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 firmware/Qemu. But this requirement conflicts with=
 the requirement to<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 support new Qemu changes with legacy OS that don&#=
39;t understand<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 MADT.GICC.online-capable Bit. Legacy OS during boo=
t time will ignore this<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 bit, and hence these vCPUs will not appear on such=
 OS. This is unexpected<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 behavior.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0b. In case we decide to specify vCPUs as MADT.GICC.Enabled=
 and try to unplug<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 these cold-booted vCPUs from OS (which in actualit=
y should be blocked by<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 returning error at Qemu), then features like &#39;=
kexec&#39; will break.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0c. As I understand, removal of the cold-booted vCPUs is a =
required feature<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 and x86 world allows it.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0d. Hence, either we need a specification change to make th=
e MADT.GICC.Enabled<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 and MADT.GICC.online-capable Bits NOT mutually exc=
lusive or NOT support<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 the removal of cold-booted vCPUs. In the latter ca=
se, a check can be introduced<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 to bar the users from unplugging vCPUs, which were=
 cold-booted, using QMP<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 commands. (Needs discussion!)<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Please check the patch part of this patch set:<br>

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0any corner cases. Any help related to this will be appreci=
ated!<br>
&gt; 2. Comprehensive Testing is in progress. (Positive feedback from Oracl=
e &amp; Ampere)<br>
&gt; 3. Qemu Documentation (.rst) needs to be updated.<br>
&gt; 4. The `is_enabled` and `is_present` ACPI states are now common to all=
 architectures<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0and should work seemlessely but needs thorough testing wit=
h other architectures.<br>

&gt; This work is an attempt to present a proof-of-concept of the ARM64 vCP=
U hotplug<br>
&gt; implementation to the community. This is *not* production-level code a=
nd might<br>
&gt; have bugs. Comprehensive testing is being done on HiSilicon Kunpeng920=
 SoC,<br>
&gt; Oracle, and Ampere servers. We are nearing stable code and a non-RFC<b=
r>
&gt; version shall be floated soon.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; This work is *mostly* in the lines of the discussions that have happen=
ed in the<br>
&gt; previous years [see refs below] across different channels like the mai=
ling list,<br>
&gt; Linaro Open Discussions platform, and various conferences like KVMForu=
m, etc. This<br>
&gt; RFC is being used as a way to verify the idea mentioned in this cover =
letter and<br>
&gt; to get community views. Once this has been agreed upon, a formal patch=
 shall be<br>
&gt; posted to the mailing list for review.<br>
