Thank you for the clarification. I think I misunderstood what I had read
in the virtio spec. What I have understood now is that "Element Length"
has different meanings for available and used descriptors.

Correct me if I am wrong - for available descriptors, it represents the
length of the buffer. For used descriptors, it represents the length of
the buffer that is written to by the device if it's write-only, otherwise it
has no meaning and hence can be ignored by drivers.

I too have a similar question and understanding the relation between buffer
ids in the used and available descriptors might give more insight into this. For
available descriptors, the buffer id is used to associate descriptors with a
particular buffer. I am still not very sure about ids in used descriptors.

Regarding Q1, both buffers #0 and #1 are available. In the mentioned figure,
both descriptor[0] and descriptor[1] are available. This figure follows the figure
with the caption "Using first buffer out of order". So in the first figure the device
reads buffer #1 and writes the used descriptor but it still has buffer #0 to read.
That still belongs to the device while buffer #1 can now be handled by the driver
once again. So in the next figure, the driver makes buffer #1 available again. The
device can still read buffer #0 from the previous batch of available descriptors.

Based on what I have understood, the driver can't touch the descriptor
corresponding to buffer #0 until the device acknowledges it. I did find the
figure a little confusing as well. I think once the meaning of buffer id is clear
from the driver's and device's perspective, it'll be easier to understand the
figure.

I am also not very sure about what happens when notifications are disabled.
I'll have to read up on that again. But I believe the driver still won't be able to
touch #0 until the device uses it.

I think going through the source should better explain these concepts.

Thanks,
Sahil
