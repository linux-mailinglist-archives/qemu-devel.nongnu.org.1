IIUC, with the "fixed-ram" feature, the on-disk format of a saved VM
should end up the same whether we're using traditional migration, or
multifd migration. Use of multifd is simply an optimization that lets
us write RAM in parallel to the file, with direct-io further optimizing.

There's also a clear break with libvirt between the existing on-disk
format libvirt uses, and the new fixed-ram format. So we have no backwards
compatibilty concerns added from multifd, beyond what we already have to
figure out when deciding on use of 'fixed-ram'. 

Thus I believe there is no downside to always using multifd for save
images with fixed-ram, even if we only want nchannels=1.

Yes, future proofing is a good idea.
