Hi maintainers and list,

This RFC series attempts to re-implement simpletrace.py with Rust, which
is the 1st task of Paolo's GSoC 2024 proposal.

There are two motivations for this work:
1. This is an open chance to discuss how to integrate Rust into QEMU.
2. Rust delivers faster parsing.


Introduction
============

Code framework
--------------

I choose "cargo" to organize the code, because the current
implementation depends on external crates (Rust's library), such as
"backtrace" for getting frameinfo, "clap" for parsing the cli, "rex" for
regular matching, and so on. (Meson's support for external crates is
still incomplete. [2])

The simpletrace-rust created in this series is not yet integrated into
the QEMU compilation chain, so it can only be compiled independently, e.g.
under ./scripts/simpletrace/, compile it be:

    cargo build --release

The code tree for the entire simpletrace-rust is as follows:

$ script/simpletrace-rust .
.
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── main.rs   // The simpletrace logic (similar to simpletrace.py).
    └── trace.rs  // The Argument and Event abstraction (refer to
                  // tracetool/__init__.py).

My question about meson v.s. cargo, I put it at the end of the cover
letter (the section "Opens on Rust Support").

The following two sections are lessons I've learned from this Rust
practice.


Performance
-----------

I did the performance comparison using the rust-simpletrace prototype with
the python one:

* On the i7-10700 CPU @ 2.90GHz machine, parsing and outputting a 35M
trace binary file for 10 times on each item:

                      AVE (ms)       Rust v.s. Python
Rust   (stdout)       12687.16            114.46%
Python (stdout)       14521.85

Rust   (file)          1422.44            264.99%
Python (file)          3769.37

- The "stdout" lines represent output to the screen.
- The "file" lines represent output to a file (via "> file").

This Rust version contains some optimizations (including print, regular
matching, etc.), but there should be plenty of room for optimization.

The current performance bottleneck is the reading binary trace file,
since I am parsing headers and event payloads one after the other, so
that the IO read overhead accounts for 33%, which can be further
optimized in the future.


Security
--------

This is an example.

Rust is very strict about type-checking, and it found timestamp reversal
issue in simpletrace-rust [3] (sorry, haven't gotten around to digging
deeper with more time)...in this RFC, I workingaround it by allowing
negative values. And the python version, just silently covered this
issue up.


Opens on Rust Support
=====================

Meson v.s. Cargo
----------------

The first question is whether all Rust code (including under scripts)
must be integrated into meson?

If so, because of [2] then I have to discard the external crates and
build some more Rust wheels of my own to replace the previous external
crates.

For the main part of the QEMU code, I think the answer must be Yes, but
for the tools in the scripts directory, would it be possible to allow
the use of cargo to build small tools/program for flexibility and
migrate to meson later (as meson's support for rust becomes more
mature)?


External crates
---------------

This is an additional question that naturally follows from the above
question, do we have requirements for Rust's external crate? Is only std
allowed?

Welcome your feedback!
