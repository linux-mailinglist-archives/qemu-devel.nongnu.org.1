IIRC we need to migrate ROMs in some form because they can be different on
src/dst, e.g., ROM files can upgrade after QEMU upgrades.  Here either
putting them onto migration stream, or making that fd-based should work.

Frankly I don't solidly know the details on why they can't be different.
My current understanding was that if one device boots with one version of
ROM/firmware, then it's possible the device keep interacting with the ROM
region in some way (in the form of referring addresses in this specific
version of ROM?), so that it may stop working if the ROM content changed.

IOW, if my understanding is correct, new ROM files won't get used after
migration automatically, but it requires one system reset.  When a system
reset triggered after VM migrated to destination host, it'll reload device
ROMs with the files specified (which will start to point to the upgraded
version of ROM files), and IIUC that's where the devices will boostrap with
the new ROM / BIOS files.

AFAICT, it's never about performance or making it faster when putting ROM
data on wire.  Even in this context where Steve wanted to use fd backing
the ROMs, then putting that on wire is still slower than sharing fds.

Here my previous comment / point was that this should be a small region, so
it shouldn't matter a huge deal for ROMs to migrate either through the wire
or via the fd page cache.  I wanted to remove one more dependency that we
may even need the new -alloc-anon parameter as it doesn't sound required
for ROM migrations.
