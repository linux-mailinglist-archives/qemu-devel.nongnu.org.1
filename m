Hi All,

Just wanted to add that back in v2 Klaus Jensen stated:

"I have no problem with picking this up for nvme, but I'd rather not take
 the full series through my tree without reviews/acks from the pci
 maintainers."

So I'd like to add my request that Michael and/or Marcell takes a look
when they have time.

I've been carrying more or less the first 2 patches in my CXL staging
tree for a couple of years (the initial Linux Kernel support that Lukas
Wunner is now handling was developed against this) and I would love
to see this upstream. Along with PCI and CXL and NVME usecases this
is a major part of the Confidential Compute device assignment story
via PCI/TDISP and CXL equivalent.

It's not changed in significant ways since v2 back in October last year.

Thanks,

Jonathan
