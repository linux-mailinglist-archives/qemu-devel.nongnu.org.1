One more argument for that may be that this A20 gate was originally 
controlled by the keyboard controller and that's part of the superio. The 
VIA southbridge docs even mention something about the KBC and this port92 
register controlling the A20 gate together. So to implement that correctly 
it may need to be in the same device. However this may be specific to the 
VIA chip so not sure if this implementation can be shared by all the 
southbridge devices.

One thing that bothers me very much about this port92 device is that we 
have about 100 lines of code of which the actual functionality is just a 
qemu_irq and an uint8_t controlling it and storing the register value. 
That shouldn't be more than 10 lines or maybe 20 with migration support, 
it's only 100 lines because it's wrapped in a QDev. Bernhard wanted to 
move it out from the PC machines to clean those up but as a result this 
mess is just pushed down in the southbridge (or into superio as you 
propose). It could easily be implemented in the southbridge or superio by 
just adding the qemu_irq and the register value and maybe export it as a 
property so the machine can set it for migration compatibility and then we 
don't need a separate QDev wrapper around it as the superio or southbridge 
is already a QDev and has the needed stuff to store this.

But one could also argue that while these southbridges implement this 
functionality, it's only used on the PC machines so as we already have it 
modelled in a separate object we could just let the PC machines 
instantiate it and leave it as it is and don't add this to other machines 
where it's not needed.

(I like Mark's proposal a bit better only because that leaves the 
southbridge untouched and changes the superio instead that I care less 
about but the issue is the same there.)

BALATON Zoltan
