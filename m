Into Waker. Do we have any idea yet how explicit we want to be with type
annotations that aren't strictly necessary? I didn't think of making it
explicit here because the only thing that is done with it is building a
Context from it, so it seemed obvious enough.

If you think that being explicit is better, then Waker::from() might
be better than adding a type name to let and keeping .into().

Oops, thanks. I need to learn that unsafe Rust still isn't C. :-)

If we could get bindgen to actually do that for the C interface, then
this could be interesting, though for most functions it also would
remain unused boilerplate. If we have to get the executor manually on
the Rust side for each function, that's probably the same function that
will want to execute the future - in which case it just can directly
call the correct function.

The long term idea should be anyway that C coroutines disappear from the
path and we integrate an executor into the QEMU main loop. But as long
as the block layer core is written in C and uses coroutines and we want
Rust futures to be able to call into coroutine_fns, that's still a long
way to go.
