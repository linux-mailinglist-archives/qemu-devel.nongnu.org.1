Makes sense. Will simplify in v2.

See https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/issues/3426 where I asked if
glib should provide a more generic sanitizer.  In turn, I found glib
does have:

char*
g_uri_escape_string (
  const char* unescaped,
  const char* reserved_chars_allowed,
  gboolean allow_utf8
)

which is a bit more powerful (you have some fine-tuning on what gets
escaped), but a different escaping mechanism (%XX instead of \uXXXX
escapes, where % rather than \ is special).  I'm not sure whether it
is nicer to have a malloc'd result or to append into a larger g_string
as the base operation (and where you could write an easy wrapper to
provide the other operation).

"append to" works, will simplify.

If we encounter more users, I could see this morphing into a backend
that takes a flag argument on knobs like whether to escape " or ',
whether to preserve printing Unicode, ...; coupled with frontends with
fewer arguments that pass the right flags intot the backend.

Indeed, more documentation here wouldn't hurt (both on \ and " being
escaped, and on U+FFFD codepoints being placed into the output
stream).

Naming is always tough.  Your suggestion is longer, but indeed
accurate.  Maybe a shorter compromise of append_escaped_mod_utf8()?
