Yeah, in theory we would have a "memory device" for all boot memory 
(boot DIMM, not sure ...) and that one would actually be marked as "spm".

It's not really a thing of a memory backend after all, it's only how 
that memory is exposed to the VM.

And given we don't have a boot memory device, the idea was to set it for 
the Node, where it means "all boot memory is SPM". And we only allow one 
type of boot memory (one memory backend) per node in QEMU.

The tricky question is what happens with memory hotplug (DIMMs etc) on 
such a node. I'd argue that it's simply not SPM.

That makes sense.

:)

If it's a per-node thing, MHP flags feel a bit like "too late". It 
should be configured earlier for the node somehow.

Thanks for taking a look!
