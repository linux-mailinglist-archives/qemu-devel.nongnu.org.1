Of course, I thought about that too.

No, with this series and new feature enabled we don't have this drain,
see

     if (dev->backend_transfer) {
         return 0;
     }

at start of do_vhost_virtqueue_stop().

In management layer we have to manage two end-points for remote
disk, and accompany a safe switch from one to another. That's
complicated and often long procedure, which contributes an
average delay of 0.6 seconds, and (which is worse) ~2.4 seconds
in p99.

Of course, you may say "just rewrite your management layer to
work better":) But that's not simple, and we came to idea, that
we can do the whole local migration at QEMU side, not touching
backend at all.

The main benefit: fewer participants. We don't rely on management layer
and vhost-user server to do proper things for migration. Backend even
don't know, that QEMU is updated. This makes the whole process
simpler and therefore safer.

The disk service may also be temporarily down at some time, which of course has
a bad effect on live migration and its freeze-time. We avoid this
issue with my series (as we don't communicate to the backend in
any way during migration, and disk service should not manage any
endpoints switching)

Note also, that my series is not a precedent in QEMU, and not a totally new
mode.

Steve Sistare works on the idea to pass backends through UNIX socket, and it
is now merged as cpr-transfer and cpr-exec migration modes, and supports
VFIO devices.

So, my work shares this existing concept on vhost-user-blk and virtio-net,
and may be used as part of cpr-transfer / cpr-exec, or in separate.

Hmm, if say only about draining, as I understand, the only thing we need
is support migrating of "inflight region". This done in the series,
and we are also preparing a separate feature to support migrating
inflight region for remote migration.

But, for local migration we want more: remove disk service from
the process at all, to have a guaranteed small downtime for live updates.
independent of any problems which may occur on disk service side.

Why freeze-time is more sensitive for live-updates than for remote
migration? Because we have to run a lot of live-update operations:
simply update all the vms in the cloud to a new version. Remote
migration happens much less frequently: when we need to move all
vms from physical server to reboot it (or repair it, serve it, etc).

So, I still believe, that migrating backend states through QEMU migration
stream makes sense in general, and for vhost-user-blk it works well too.
