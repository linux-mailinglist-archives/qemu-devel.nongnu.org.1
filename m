If we had a way to detect that the user has modified some parameters via
the cmdline, then we could merge that with the s->defaults and restore
it before applying config, that would achieve what you want. I'm in
favor, -global should only be used for debugging, I think it's fine if
we let it go through. But anything set by migrate-set-parameters
definitely needs to be reset. I just need a way to differentiate between
"default parameter" vs. "default parameter that got overwritten by
-global". I'll try to figure something out.

At this point you've probably done more migrations than any single
person. So of course your use-case is important. I don't think an extra
knob is too much to ask. Could even be -global only.

However, if we're going to keep both requirements working: 1) overwrite
migrate-set-params; 2) do not overwrite -global; as I said we need a way
to detect a parameter changed via -global... and then we don't need a
new knob because that would already tell us.

Good question, I don't think we've decided. Those last few patches could
have kept the RFC tag. I say we:

- Merge params+caps and deprecate migrate-set-capabilities now.

  One is an internal change and the other is a normal command
  deprecation, AFAIK.

- Make sure we agree on how config is going to work and introduce it
  then (possibly this release).

  We also need to make sure this is the right thing for savevm, cpr,
  etc. It would be good to have all of them uniformly prepared to take
  (or not) the config parameter.

- Leave migrate-set-parameters as is.
  (this wasn't my original intention, but this discussion changed my
  mind)

  As I said, we can't predict whether the user will call
  migrate-set-parameters before calling migrate. So I don't think we can
  say:

    "Only use this if you're not using the new 'config' option OR if
     you're using the new 'config' option plus setting runtime parameters"

  It also gives us the ability to say that nothing changes with
  migrate-set-parameter except that it now takes caps as well.

- The migrate-set-parameters change is just an addition of options. We
  do this anytime a new feature is added and I don't think there are
  issues downstream. Are there?

- Dropping migrate-set-capabilities would be covered by the deprecation
  period. We shouldn't have to think about it. But let's say we _are_
  going to think about it: a libvirt from before the removal of the
  command would have trouble with a QEMU from after the
  removal. Converting between the two may not be trivial because caps
  today take a MigrationCapabilityList which is a more complex data
  structure than just key=value as MigrationParameters.

- The 'config' change is supported by keeping migrate-set-parameters
  around, so it wouldn't affect anything. Just don't use the new API.

I think that's it? Am I being too simplistic?

I think we can do this without breaking anything. We could bring more
people into the discussion to double-check. Let's just agree between
ourselves on some of these other details.

I don't discard the possibility of simply dropping it. But I see Daniel
(and Markus on the previous version) making compelling points.
