creating a getter nbd_client_get_cookie(client), and use it instead of passing together with client, will simplify the patch a lot. [*]

Hmm.. don't we need some atomic accessors for nbd_cookie? and for nbs_server->connections.. The function is called from client, which live in coroutine and maybe in another thread? At least client code do atomic accesses of client->refcount..

[*] passing client->close_cokkie together with client itself looks like we lack a getter for .close_cookie

Hmm, instead of cookies and additional NBDConn objects in the next patch, could we simply have a list of connected NBDClient objects in NBDServer and link to NBDServer in NBDClient? (Ok we actually don't have NBDServer, but NBDServerData in qemu, and several global variables in qemu-nbd, so some refactoring is needed, to put common state to NBDServer, and add clients list to it)

This way, in nbd_server_free we'll just call client_close() in a loop. And in client_close we'll have nbd_server_client_detach(client->server, client), instead of client->close_fn(...). And server is freed only after all clients are closed. And client never try to detach from another server.

This way, we also may implement several NBD servers working simultaneously if we want.
