I'm not completely sure if this is a good idea at all, but I think we
should at least mention the possible surprising cases where the
heuristics fails in this comment.

One thing is that '_unsupported_fmt qcow' will also disable the test
case for qcow2. 181 would almost run into this, but because it has
'_supported_fmt generic' first (which is an order not required by
anything else) and you stop after seeing this line, the test as written
currently is still returned (for both qcow and qcow2).

Actually, I suspect that the '_supported_fmt generic' tests that are
then followed by an '_unsupported_fmt' line are the majority of the
still skipped cases you see. (We don't have to do anything about it,
just an observation.)

There are other theoretical scenarios, like multiple options on a single
line in Python, but I think in practice you'll never combine block
driver names that this would skip something it shouldn't skip (apart
from the same 'qcow2' and 'qcow' problem).
