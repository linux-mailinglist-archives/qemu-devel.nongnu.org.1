OK, I am trying to get that patch pushed upstream.  I will be sure we fix your
issues before we do that.

The patch I have put in 6.12 only helps with earlycon.  Regular output has
always been working for me.  I will work on testing your image again to see what
is special about it.

Note, I did find some issues with the kernel nor properly handling stdout-path.
It seems that if there are multiple uarts the first one will always be used as
the default uart.  Only the console= command line argument can be used to
override that.

So as long as the kernel selects the first uart as the stdout path (it should
have always been the case)  AND qemu picks the first uart as the uart connected
to the console (it should be with my latest patch) we should get serial output.

Another thing that may get me delayed is that I need to rebuild my or1k-elf-gdb
as it's python version is no longer compatible with the kernel's python.
