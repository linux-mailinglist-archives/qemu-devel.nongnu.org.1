Hi Eric,

Is that possible?  I think the device_memory_base being force to align
to a 1 GiB means that never happens.  That seems to occur even
if there is no device_memory.  

    device_memory_base =
        ROUND_UP(vms->memmap[VIRT_MEM].base + ms->ram_size, GiB);
    device_memory_size = ms->maxram_size - ms->ram_size + ms->ram_slots * GiB;

    /* Base address of the high IO region */
    memtop = base = device_memory_base + ROUND_UP(device_memory_size, GiB);
//So here we are GiB aligned.
...

    if (base < vms->memmap[VIRT_MEM].base + LEGACY_RAMLIMIT_BYTES) {
        base = vms->memmap[VIRT_MEM].base + LEGACY_RAMLIMIT_BYTES;
    }

//That's 256 GiB in or leave it alone as more than that but GiB aligned.

   /* We know for sure that at least the memory fits in the PA space */
    vms->highest_gpa = memtop - 1;

    virt_set_high_memmap(vms, base, pa_bits);


So I think I'm fine. I should call out that REDIST2 is GiB
aligned though in this patch description.

This was mostly a response to Peter expressed that he was expecting
highest_gpa to reflect the limit, not the highest yet seen.

I'm not sure how to resolve that without having awkward naming
like highest_gpa_sofar. There are existing comments where it is updated
so I'm not thinking we need to change anything for this.


Thanks for taking a look,

Jonathan
