Could we get back to this and either accept this patch or find another 
solution? From the above, it looks like this could be an acceptable fix 
unless we can prove it would break something (but then it's already 
possible to break it from the command line option so it's preexisting 
problem).

Can you suggest how can I test that? I'm not sure what to try and sound 
works with this patch for the cases I use.
