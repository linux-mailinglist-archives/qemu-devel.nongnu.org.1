This is not done for performance but for safety (as in safety
certifications, ISO 26262, etc.). This is to enable unprivileged virtio
backends running in a DomU. By unprivileged I mean a virtio backend that
is unable to map arbitrary memory (the xenforeignmemory interface is
prohibited).

The goal is to run Xen on safety-critical systems such as cars,
industrial robots and more. In this configuration there is no
traditional Dom0 in the system at all. If you  would like to know more:

I think you mean Xen PV drivers. Yes we have been using them for a
while. Now we would also like to add the option of running virtio
devices but we can only do that if the virtio backend is unprivileged as
we have no Dom0 in the system.
