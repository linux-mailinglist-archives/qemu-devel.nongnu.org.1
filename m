I don't want to think about things like "does this need documentation",
or "where does the documentation go".  I want our tools to be able to
decide that for us.

I figure almost all of them are thoroughly uninteresting.  If that turns
out to be the case, we delete the uninteresting ones, then decide what
to do about each of the few interesting ones.

Yes.  We're reinventing reST there for historical reasons only.  And our

When I rewrote the doc parser, I aimed for such simplifications, but
qapidoc.py resisted change too much to be worth it, so I shelved the
idea.

Yes.

I'm curious how many of them we'll need in practice.

Well, we need *some* solution to make inlining viable.  Since inlining
is desirable, and no better solution comes to mind, let's explore this
one.
