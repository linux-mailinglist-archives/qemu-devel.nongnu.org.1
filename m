The endianness on a MemoryRegionOps struct tells the
memory core how to handle guest accesses to the
*registers* that struct is for. So if the .endianness
is DEVICE_LITTLE_ENDIAN and the guest is big-endian,
the memory core will byteswap the data values. That
means that the read and write functions always take
and return "value" arguments which are what you expect
(i.e. the guest wrote 0x12345678 and the write fn
value argument is 0x12345678).

However, if a device does direct accesses to guest *memory* (like
a DMA-capable device will do), that is something it has to handle
the endianness for itself. (The device's manual should say what
way round it does memory loads.)
There are two basic ways a device can do guest memory access:

 (1) we provide functions which say "load from guest memory
 a value of this type with this endianness"; for instance
 ldq_le_dma() will load a 64-bit little-endian value into a
 host C uint64_t, and ldq_be_dma() will do the same for a 64-bit
 big-endian value. There are similar functions for stores.
 This can be the simplest approach but it's a bit less efficient
 because it goes up and down the memory subsystem for each data
 item being read.

 (2) we provide functions which are "load/store a sequence of bytes
 from guest memory". This is what dma_memory_read() does.
 Because it's just a sequence of bytes, the device code is
 then responsible for interpreting what those bytes mean:
 maybe they're just bytes, or maybe they're a sequence of
 little-endian 32-bit values, or maybe they're something else.
 The device code also has to deal with the fact that the
 alignment of these values in memory is not necessarily the
 same as what the host CPU requires. These things together
 mean you can't simply cast the pointer to a sequence-of-bytes
 to a host type, or tell dma_memory_read() to write the
 sequence-of-bytes to a host struct type. We provide functions
 like ldl_le_p() to say "read a little-endian 32-bit value
 from this host pointer location" to assist in pulling
 values out of a sequence-of-bytes array. Or if the data is
 all of the same type (eg it's an array of 32-bit values)
 you can dma_memory_read() it into a host uint32_t[] array
 and then use le32_to_cpu() to convert those uint32_t values
 to the host's endianness.

(I use the dma_* family of functions here as an example since that's
what xlnx_dpdma.c happens to use; the same general principle applies
for our various other families of guest load/store functions, like
the address_space_* ones.)
