Be careful with saying "The goal isnot to be accurate", as that's
a very broad statement, and I don't think it is true.


If you're doing A/B comparisons, you *do* need accuracy, in the
sense that if a guest workload config change alters host CPU
power consumption, you want that to be reflected in what the
guest is told about its power usagte.

ie if a change in B moves some power usage from a vCPU thread
to a non-vCPU thread, you don't want that power usage to
disappear from what's reported to the guest. It would give you
the false idea that B is more efficient than A, even if the
non-vCPU thread for B was cosuming x2 what the orignal vCPU
thread was for A.

What I think you don't need is for the absolute magnitude of
the reported power consumption to be a precise match to the
actual power consumption.

ie if A and B are reported as 7 and 9 Watts respectively, it
doesn't matter if the actual consumption was 12 and 15 watts.

The relationship between the two measurements is still valid,
and enables tuning, despite the magnitude being under-reported.

With regards,
Daniel
