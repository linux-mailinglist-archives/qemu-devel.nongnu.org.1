Now I'm confused :)

It is related to ObjectType / ObjectType.

Is it related to anything else in the QMP reference manual, and if yes,
to what exactly is it related?

We don't have to create files just to get a desired section structure.

I'll show you how in a jiffie, but before I do that, let me stress: we
should figure out what we want *first*, and only then how to get it.
So, what section structure would make the most sense for the QMP
reference manual?

A few hints on how...

Consider how qapi/block.json includes qapi/block-core.json:

    ##
    # = Block devices
    ##

    { 'include': 'block-core.json' }

    ##
    # == Additional block stuff (VM related)
    ##

block-core.json starts with

    ##
    # == Block core (VM unrelated)
    ##

Together, this produces this section structure

    = Block devices
    == 
    ##

Together, this produces this section structure

    = Block devices
    == Block core (VM unrelated)
    == Additional block stuff (VM related)

Note that qapi/block-core.json isn't included anywhere else.
qapi/qapi-schema.json advises:

    # Documentation generated with qapi-gen.py is in source order, with
    # included sub-schemas inserted at the first include directive
    # (subsequent include directives have no effect).  To get a sane and
    # stable order, it's best to include each sub-schema just once, or
    # include it first right here.
