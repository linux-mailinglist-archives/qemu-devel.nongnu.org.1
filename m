Just curious; how did you collect these?

Don't you want to still keep a few multifd / file tests?

IIUC some file ops can still be relevant to archs.  Multifd still has one
bug that can only reproduce on arm64.. but not x86_64.  I remember it's a
race condition when migration finishes, and the issue could be memory
ordering relevant, but maybe not.

dirty ring will be disabled anyway when !x86, so probably not a major
concern.

These are the 10 slowest tests when I run locally:

/x86_64/migration/multifd/tcp/tls/x509/allow-anon-client 2.41
/x86_64/migration/postcopy/recovery/plain 2.43
/x86_64/migration/multifd/tcp/tls/x509/default-host 2.66
/x86_64/migration/multifd/tcp/tls/x509/override-host 2.86
/x86_64/migration/postcopy/tls/psk 2.91
/x86_64/migration/postcopy/preempt/recovery/tls/psk 3.08
/x86_64/migration/postcopy/preempt/tls/psk 3.30
/x86_64/migration/postcopy/recovery/tls/psk 3.81
/x86_64/migration/vcpu_dirty_limit 13.29
/x86_64/migration/precopy/unix/xbzrle 27.55

Are you aware of people using xbzrle at all?

Agree with the general idea, but I worry above exact list can be too small.

IMHO we can definitely, at least, move the last two into slow list
(vcpu_dirty_limit and xbzrle), then it'll already save us 40sec each run..
