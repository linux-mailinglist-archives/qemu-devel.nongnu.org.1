Should we neccessarily assume that target machine's error is the "best"
error message ?  Failures can result in errors being raised on both the
source and dest, and it is not clearcut which side will have the root
cause error, and which will just have a side effect error. If we pass
the target error back to the source, we need to ensure that we don't
replace a better error that the source already has.

Allowing use of 'query-migrate' to fetch errors on both the source and
dest means mgmt apps have both errors available, but that does then
mean the mgmt app needs to decide which error is "best".

With regards,
Daniel
