It doesn't affect this series. It is for future work.

We'll see if the LTPC replies to my concerns.

For now I've just applied it to my tree. I believe my offer of adding
non-CMDLINE lwip immediately after you applied it was a good

I sent a PR for the test series, to try to get that landed in your
tree. At least that will help reduce the diff with new tests. The PR
is the only prereq for v5 of this series (Ubuntu test).

Well let's see how things go over the next few days.
