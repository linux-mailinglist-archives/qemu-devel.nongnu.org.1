Forget about the 1 GiB size. This is something that we won't need to deal with
because we don't align in 1 Gib.

Let's say for example that we want to support pc-dimm hotplug of 256 slots like the
'virt' ARM machine does. Let's also say that we will allow users to hotplug any
DIMM size they want, taking care of any alignment issues by ourselves.

In hw/riscv/boot.c I see that our alignment sizes are 4Mb for 32 bits and 2Mb for
64 bits. Forget 32 bits a bit and let's say that our alignment is 2Mb.

So, in a worst case scenario, an user could hotplug 256 slots, all of them unaligned,
and then we would need to align each one of them by adding 2Mb. So, to account for
this alignment fixup, we would need 256 * 2Mb RAM reserved for it.

What I said about "If we take care to avoid plugging unaligned memory we might not even
need this spare area" is a possible design where we would force every hotplugged DIMM
to always be memory aligned, avoiding the need for this spare RAM for alignment. This
would put a bit of extra straing in users/management apps to always deliver aligned
DIMMs.

In hindsight this is not needed. It's fairly easy to reserve ACPI_MAX_RAM_SLOTS * (2Mb/4Mb)
and let users hotplug whatever DIMM size they want.

Hope this explains the situation a bit. If we agree on allocating this spare RAM for
hotplugged mem alignment, we'll probalby need a pre-patch to do a little handling of
ms->ram_slots, limiting it to ACPI_MAX_RAM_SLOTS (ram_slots can be changed via command
line). Then it's a matter of reserving ms->ram_slots * align_size when calculating
device_memory_size.


Thanks,

Daniel
