I have the confusion because no matter from SDM:

   Bit 23-16: Maximum number of addressable IDs for logical processors in
              this physical package*

   * The nearest power-of-2 integer that is not smaller than EBX[23:16]
     is the number of unique initial APIC IDs reserved for addressing
     different logical processors in a physical package.

or from "Intel 64 Architecture Processor Topology Enumeration" spec，(Jan 
2018, revision 1.1), 1.5.3 "sub ID Extraction Parameters for Inital APIC ID"

   RoundToNearestPof2(CPUID.1:EBX[23:16])

or from "Intel 64 Architecture Processor Topology Enumeration" 
spec，(April 2023, revision 2.0), 1.6.1 Legacy Extraction Algorithm

https://cdrdv2-public.intel.com/775917/intel-64-architecture-processor-topology-enumeration.pdf

   "MaximumLogicalProcessorIDsPerPackage" is calculated by rounding
    CPUID.01H.EBX[23:16] to nearest power of 2.

what I read from them is that EBX[23:16] is a different thing than 
pow2ceil(EBX[23:16]) and EBX[23:16] doesn't need to be power-of-2, but 
the patch are trying to make it power-of-2.

Then I consult it with Intel internal architect. I was told that 
EBX[23:16] used to be that software was to round to the next power of 2. 
However, software had issues a long time ago because applications could 
then compute the wrong power of 2 based on APIC ID holes or some 
applications would use it directly (without round it up to power-of-2).
So intel became to report exact power-of-2 and this behavior is not 
documented.
