Peter Krempa tells us libvirt would benefit.

I suspect many of these poison pills are design mistakes.

If a property is not valid for the configuration, why does it exist?
QOM is by design dynamic.  I wish it wasn't, but as long as it is
dynamic, I can't see why we should create properties we know to be
unusable.

Why is reading crash-information an error when no crash occured?  This
is the *normal* case.  Errors are for the abnormal.

Anyway, asking you to fix design mistakes all over the place wouldn't be
fair.  So I'm asking you something else instead: do you actually need
the error information?
