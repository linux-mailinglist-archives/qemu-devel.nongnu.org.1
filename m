If you can't share that private patch, perhaps you can create a
dummy patch with the same type of diff structure that shows the
problem ?

I don't think that's a problem. It is just a different way ot getting
a list of git commit hashes to analyse - it'll still operate against
a patch diff IIUC.

FWIW, I use   'checkpatch.pl master..' and/or 'git show| checkpatch.pl -'
