I haven=E2=80=99t had the chance to test it yet, but we plan to have so=

evaluate and benchmark your approach against my dirty-tracking-based
initial implementation. It=E2=80=99s good to hear there are no major bl=
ockers to
supporting `migrate=5Fincoming` on a dirty QEMU instance. If your propo=
sed
solution proves effective but restarting QEMU remains costly, we may al=
so
explore implementing the necessary changes to enable `migrate=5Fincomin=
g`
directly on a dirty QEMU.

In most of our use cases, we would have a complete snapshot anyway, and=
 the
cost is a one-time expense. However, you=E2=80=99re right, a diff/CoW m=
echanism
would be sufficient.

Sure :)

Thanks for your inputs!
