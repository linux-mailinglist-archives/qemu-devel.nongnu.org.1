Just have a glance at the IGVM series (which is a news to me). The IGVM 
series looks specific to SEV-*. Though some of the callbacks introduced 
in ConfidentialGuestSupportClass can be tweaked for TDX, but the 
arguments introduced are specific to SEV-*.

Aside from above, are you going to map (sev-*)'s policy to TDX's 
attributes? I don't think it is a good idea. It mixes up things with 
limited benefit. To me, the common of them is only they are both  64-bit 
field.

I'm not reluctant to expose TD's attribute as a raw 64-bit data in QAPI 
structure. I just don't like the idea of the permitted mask, which makes 
the 64-bit field incomplete, and makes things complicated. People need 
to learn that some bits are configured in attribute directly while other 
bits are configured via cpu properties indirectly.

Maybe we can allow the direct configurability of raw 64-bit attribute 
and give it highest priority. If inconsistent value is provided via cpu 
properties, warn it and let the attribute value overwrite CPU properties?
