Except that this proposal uses GStreamer from rust so would also pull in 
all the rust dependencies too which is still not needed for QEMU. Saying 
that it's optional but then you lose audio output is also not quite 
acceptable.

Yes, but as QEMU has SDL for systems where that's supported it could also 
have GStreamer as another option but not as the sole option replacing 
other backends.

Jack has capability to route between sources and sinks with low latency 
which pulse/pipewire does not have and it allows processing sound better 
than using plain ALSA. Jack is useful for example when running sound tools 
in virtual machines and want to integrate with host sound tools that 
usually support jack. ALSA is useful if you just want to output sound the 
simplest way without adding latency or complexity. The other backends are 
useful to integrate with other apps/environments using those sound 
services.

At least one of them already said it wouldn't. Also why somebody not 
running a desktop environment that uses GStreamer would want to add that 
dependency and use a GStreamer plugin to get the sound back to their 
native sound service when it is probably already supported by QEMU 
directly? QEMU also has to support Windows and macOS sound services so 
having a few more Linux/Unix ones does not make it much more complex.
