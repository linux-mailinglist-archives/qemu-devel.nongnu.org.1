Hi Dan,

I checked the GHES, EDAC codes. I think they belong to FW-First path. 
GHES polls mem errors, then
  1. report by EDAC
  2. construct a MCE, mce_log(), and handle in work queue
  3. queue it into memory_failure right now if needed (sync, ...)
And community is adding CXL FW-First trace support[1].

But in OS-First path, error record is sent to CXL driver via MSI, it 
won't conflict with FW-First path, I think.

I'm not very sure about 'Host write/read' type.  In my opinion, these 
two types of event should be sent from device when CPU is accessing a 
bad memory address, they could be thought of a sync event which needs 
the 'MF_ACTION_REQUIRED' flag.  Then, we can determine the flag by the 
types like this:
- CXL_EVENT_TRANSACTION_READ | CXL_EVENT_TRANSACTION_WRITE
                                               => MF_ACTION_REQUIRED
- CXL_EVENT_TRANSACTION_INJECT_POISON         => MF_SW_SIMULATED
- others                                      => 0
