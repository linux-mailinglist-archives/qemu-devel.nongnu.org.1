So? That might just mean we had a bug and we fixed it.
4.2 is a very old version of QEMU and nobody seems to have
complained in the four years since we released 5.0 about this,
which suggests that generally guest OS drivers don't try
to send zero-length buffers in this way.

> I don't think it's valid to ask for a *popular* guest OS as a proof-of-co=
ncept because I'm not an expert on those.

I didn't ask for "popular"; I asked for "real-world".
What is the actual guest code you're running that falls over
because of the behaviour change?

More generally, why do you want this behaviour to be
changed? Reasonable reasons might include:
 * we're out of spec based on reading the documentation
 * you're trying to run some old Windows VM/QNX/etc image,
   and it doesn't work any more
 * all the real hardware we tested behaves this way

But don't necessarily include:
 * something somebody wrote and only tested on QEMU happens to
   assume the old behaviour rather than following the hw spec

QEMU occasionally works around guest OS bugs, but only as
when we really have to. It's usually better to fix the
bug in the guest.
