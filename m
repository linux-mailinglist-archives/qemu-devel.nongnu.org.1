If the machine property is the only way to go then I agree that might be a
good idea, even though the name can be further discussed.  But I still want
to figure out something below.

True, but if you see my whole point is trying to see whether we can get rid
of the machine property completely, and it's also because we're just so
close to getting rid of it.. which I feel.

QEMU memory layout can be complicated across all the platforms, but I doubt
whether that's true for CPR's purpose and archs that it plans to support.
A generic VM's memory topology shouldn't be that complicated at all,
e.g. on x86:

It's simply the major ram, ROMs, and VGA.

I hoped it can work without it, I'll mention one more reason below.

So if we're going to have this machine property, can I still request a
possible list of things that can be the target of this property besides
guest mem?  I just want to know where it can be used "for real".  I know it
might be complicated, but maybe not.  I really can only think of VGA, and I
doubt whether that should be DMAed at all.

Let me explain the other reason why I don't want to have that machine
property..

That property, irrelevant of what it is called (and I doubt whether Dan's
suggestion on "shared-ram" is good, e.g. mmap(MAP_SHARED) doesn't have user
visible fd but it's shared-ram for sure..), is yet another way to specify
guest mem types.

What if the user specified this property but specified something else in
the -object parameters?  E.g. -machine share-ram=on -object
memory-backend-ram,share=off.  What should we do?

Fundamentally that's also why I "hope" we can avoid adding yet one more
place configure guest mem, and stick with -objects.

I hope it won't ever happen that we introduced this property because "we
don't know", then when we know we found no real RAM regions are using it if
properly specify -object.  So I hope at least we know what we're doing, and
for explicitly what reason..

Let me know if you think I'm asking too much (which is possible.. :).  But I
hope in case that might be interesting to you too to know the real answer.

Thanks,
