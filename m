That ship sailed in RHEL over a decade and a half ago.

There is already a mountain of devices and other QEMU features that are
/not/ shipped in RHEL, disabled at build time. Essentially RHEL is only
targetting virtualization use cases, not emulation, so the priority is
virtio devices, paired with a tiny handful of emulated devices to fill
some gaps. Historically RHEL included Cirrus, but it was marked deprecated
in RHEL quite a few years ago now, and will likely be removed entirely
in RHEL-10. The combo of stdvga and virtio-vga/gpu is sufficient for the
virtualization use case.

Yes, this does cause confusion and annoyance for users who want to try
to use RHEL with QEMU cli configs they find around the web, but that's
considered acceptable pain.

I don't see a user edittable config being useful in RHEL or Fedora.
For RHEL we have a strict policy of only shipping what we want to
support, and everything else must be fully disabled at build time.
Conversely in Fedora we aim to ship everything that QEMU provides.

I would be nice to have a tagging of "quality" status for devices
upstream, but that's not something that needs to be turned into a
user edittable matrix against machine types. A device impl is either
good or not - the code impl quality doesn't vary per machine usage,
nor should upstream try to artificially block usage per machine.

With regards,
Daniel
