Hmm, I wouldn't have expected the sync packets to have a signicant
overhead on the wire. Looking at the code though I guess the issue
is that we're blocking I/O in /all/ threads, until all threads have
seen the sync packet.

eg in multifd_recv_sync_main

    for (i = 0; i < thread_count; i++) {

        qemu_sem_wait(&multifd_recv_state->sem_sync);
    }

    for (i = 0; i < thread_count; i++) {
        qemu_sem_post(&p->sem_sync);
    }

and then in the recv thread is 

    qemu_sem_post(&multifd_recv_state->sem_sync);
    qemu_sem_wait(&p->sem_sync);

so if any 1 of the recv threads is slow to recv the sync packet on
the wire, then its qemu_sem_post is delayed, and all other recv
threads are kept idle until the sync packet arrives.

I'm not sure how much this all matters during the final switchover
phase though. We send syncs at the end of each iteration, and then
after sending the residual RAM. I'm not sure how that orders wrt
sending of the parallel VFIO state

With regards,
Daniel
