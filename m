Ok. Well, again we're not modifying HEST table structure on this
changeset. The only change affecting HEST is when the number of entries
increased from 1 to 2.

Now, looking at bios-tables-test.c, if I got it right, I should be doing
something similar to the enclosed patch, right?

If so, I have a couple of questions:

1. from where should I get the HEST table? dumping the table from the
   running VM?

2. what values should I use to fill those variables:

	int hest_offset = 40 /* HEST */;
	int hest_entry_size = 4;

Yeah, my plan is to periodically test it. I intend to setup somewhere
a CI to test Kernel, QEMU and rasdaemon altogether.

Thanks,
