My two cents.

1. QAPI vs QOM

First, QEMU has too many object-like interfaces: QOM, QAPI structures, vmstates..
Of course, it would be better to have one generic. Should it be QAPI or QOBJECT?

If I understand correctly, these series expand the QOBJECTS's zone of influence. And
Kevin argue, that it could be QAPI instead. Right?

QOBJECT is better in a way that it represent existing in-QEMU state. QAPI structures
are normally used only temporarily during QMP calls.

If everything was a QOBJECT, we probably should not have to invent all these -replace-
and -change- commands in QMP for block layer object, but only implement set/get for
corresponding QOBJECT properties. And we'd not have to unite the namespaces of
qom paths, block export names and block node names, they all would be qom paths..

So we could live in the world, where we need to implement only "action" QMP commands,
like "migrate", "quit", "cont". But to change/query the state, we always use qom-set
qom-get, and don't invent a new command for each piece of state.

On the other hand, QAPI is a lot better in a way that it have explicit json schema.
QAPI definition is a protocol specification in the same time, we don't have such
thing for QOM. Probably the best world would be a QAPI-like interface to internal
QEMU objects, which are defined by QAPI structures. A kind of combination of best
options of QOM and QAPI worlds. But that's only a dream.


2. Machine types

I'd not care about them too much. Machine type is a syntax sugar, it's simply a
"set of defaults".

So, I think it's OK to share the concept wider than guest-ABI. What's wrong if
we just rename "Machine Type" into "Set Of QOM Defaults", and follow Peter's
suggestion? This way it will not conflict with tools that doesn't start the
guest, or don't have frontends.
