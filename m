(I had a reply in the other thread, that might have covered most of the
 points but maybe not this one..)

I assume CPR is save/restore, so indeed we have 3 ways to use migration
core.

AFAICT, that's not affected by "whether we allow global settings", that is
still a concern internally as long as they use migration core.

One thing to mention is CPR is really a fine citizen here, AFAICT it is
exactly live migration using all the proper caps/params.  We _could_ split
it as many things do not apply like postcopy, but we could still just reuse
everything and ignoring the rest.  It'll be again a cleaness issue to me,
and even if CPR reuses everything it looks still clean enough, especially
comparing to savevm/loadvm.

savevm/loadvm is another story.. however afaiu if we want to decouple it,
it should be done not from the interface level, but internally first.
E.g., we should allow taking parameters as a temp pointer passing to
migration core, so that will be passed over by savevm setting all caps off,
for example, ignoring the global config.  The interface alone should, IMHO,
be done only later.

Meanwhile, even if that, IMO we can't avoid the need to think any new param
affecting savevm, as long as it's still using migration core.  I don't know
whether we need to do that one step even further to decouple savevm: I
would think the other way round to obsolete savevm completely if necessary
when we have fine "file:" migrations now, especially with mapped-ram.

Thanks,
