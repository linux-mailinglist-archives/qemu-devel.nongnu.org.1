Thats cool.  I got around to testing the patch with Linux, unfortunately I didnt
see an improvement in the lockups I have been seeing during boot time.  But I am
sure this is a step in the right direction.

Hi, I was waiting for this second version patch, v2.  Have you ever completed it?

You might be right, but if that is the case maybe it's a but to raise to the
maintainers directly.  I was planning to look into this more cosely after you
sent the followup patch.
