To Daniil as well.  Since Peter is okay with it on behalf of libvirt, so
am I.

"One of a set of optional members" is a constraint the QAPI language
cannot express, so we have to leave enforcing it to handwritten code,
and documenting it to handwritten comments.

If it could express it, the constraint would be visible in
introspection, and we'd have less handwritten code.  The price is
additional QAPI language and generator complexity.  Sensible tradeoff?
Hard to tell without patches.  Risk: we pay for patches only to find out
the answer is no.  Another risk: we pay for patches, then take them just
because we already paid for them, then continue to pay upkeep.

I don't mean to say such QAPI language enhancements are a bad idea.  I'm
just pointing out the tradeoff to weigh, and the risks to take.

There are more constraints that could be supported by the language,
e.g. integer ranges.

Yes, because the unit isn't obvious from the type.  It is for things
like byte counts, where we've succeeded at sticking to one plain
unit[*].  We failed for time, so there it isn't obvious.

Could use the same treatment for consistency.  Not a demand.
