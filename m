Responding here to point out that in
https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-82906, Peter Krempa identified
that it was Nir's earlier patch:

that changed qemu's behavior last year to be closer to its documentation.

It raises the question: should we change the default for "discard"
from "ignore" (what we currently have, where write zeroes defaults to
full allocation if you didn't request otherwise - but where this patch
series demonstrates that we can still be careful to avoid writing
zeroes to something that already reads as zeroes as a way to preserve
sparseness) to "unmap" (ie. we would favor sparse files by default,
but where you can still opt-in to full allocation)?

What are the policies on changing defaults?  Do we have to issue a
deprecation notice for any block device opened without specifying a
"discard" policy, and go through a couple of release cycles, so that
two releases down the road we can change the "discard" parameter from
optional to mandatory, and then even later switch it back to optional
but with a new default?
