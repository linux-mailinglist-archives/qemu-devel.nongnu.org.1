Right. I don't mind doing the work to inline it, but I'm not sure
it is best. Inline commands/events that don't have fields are
straight forward and look nice but what when they have several
fields instead?

Wrt to mandatory and optional fields, I think it is
straightforward when looking at the struct definition that might
be confusing to the methods args.

As example, block-stream command has 12 fields, only 1 mandatory.

    // .. qmp-example::    -> { "execute": "block-stream",
    // "arguments": { "device": "virtio0",             "base":
    // "/tmp/master.qcow2" } }   <- { "return": {} }
    type BlockStreamCommand struct {
        // identifier for the newly-created block job. If omitted, the
        // device name will be used. (Since 2.7)
        JobId *string `json:"job-id,omitempty"`
        // the device or node name of the top image
        Device string `json:"device"`
        // the common backing file name. It cannot be set if @base-node or
        // @bottom is also set.
        Base *string `json:"base,omitempty"`
        // the node name of the backing file. It cannot be set if @base or
        // @bottom is also set. (Since 2.8)
        BaseNode *string `json:"base-node,omitempty"`
        // The backing file string to write into the top image. This
        // filename is not validated. If a pathname string is such that it
        // cannot be resolved by QEMU, that means that subsequent QMP or
        // HMP commands must use node-names for the image in question, as
        // filename lookup methods will fail. If not specified, QEMU will
        // automatically determine the backing file string to use, or
        // error out if there is no obvious choice. Care should be taken
        // when specifying the string, to specify a valid filename or
        // protocol. (Since 2.1)
        BackingFile *string `json:"backing-file,omitempty"`
        // If true, replace any protocol mentioned in the 'backing file
        // format' with 'raw', rather than storing the protocol name as
        // the backing format. Can be used even when no image header will
        // be updated (default false; since 9.0).
        BackingMaskProtocol *bool `json:"backing-mask-protocol,omitempty"`
        // the last node in the chain that should be streamed into top. It
        // cannot be set if @base or @base-node is also set. It cannot be
        // filter node. (Since 6.0)
        Bottom *string `json:"bottom,omitempty"`
        // the maximum speed, in bytes per second
        Speed *int64 `json:"speed,omitempty"`
        // the action to take on an error (default report). 'stop' and
        // 'enospc' can only be used if the block device supports io-
        // status (see BlockInfo). (Since 1.3)
        OnError *BlockdevOnError `json:"on-error,omitempty"`
        // the node name that should be assigned to the filter driver that
        // the stream job inserts into the graph above @device. If this
        // option is not given, a node name is autogenerated. (Since: 6.0)
        FilterNodeName *string `json:"filter-node-name,omitempty"`
        // When false, this job will wait in a PENDING state after it has
        // finished its work, waiting for @block-job-finalize before
        // making any block graph changes. When true, this job will
        // automatically perform its abort or commit actions. Defaults to
        // true. (Since 3.1)
        AutoFinalize *bool `json:"auto-finalize,omitempty"`
        // When false, this job will wait in a CONCLUDED state after it
        // has completely ceased all work, and awaits @block-job-dismiss.
        // When true, this job will automatically disappear from the query
        // list without user intervention. Defaults to true. (Since 3.1)
        AutoDismiss *bool `json:"auto-dismiss,omitempty"`
    }

Might be easier in that case to

    cmds.BlockStream(BlockStreamCommand{device:"virtio"})

instead of defining all optional args as nil.

To me it was just an extra benefit, not a vital one. We are bound
to break when user bumps it. In the real world, as far as I
recall from discussing this with Markus (feel free to correct me)

    i.  Removing fields is somewhat rare. I remember he put out
        an example but I could not find it.
    ii. Adding fields is not so rare although they are usually
        optional.
=20
With inlining approach we would break application in both cases
100% of the time. It'd be less so by using a type.

Oh, but if I'm not mistaken, if you do change the type you are
required to bump the version meaning that you'll need to
generated a new set of types with the new version. That enforces
client/side to implement the new type if they want to talk over
new version (enforced by capabilites negotiation). Not a great
dev experience but it surely works and performance is good too...
but I digress.

imho, just a extra benefit. Breaking is somewhat fine if it
happens only when we bump the version and is not something that
happens so often that it becomes a bother.
