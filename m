It would be interesting maybe to restrict the set of
states/triggers/events (I'm not sure) to user-visible phases only, and
those would be defined by anything that's triggered via a QMP
command. Plus the error state which goes in the other direction.

In isolation, having a "trigger" for each QMP command seems like a good
idea to me. It could be just a flag that tells us what is the current
command that's being serviced. Most of migration are actions in response
to a QMP command. This could help with ensuring correctness in
concurrent invocations.

I like this because it forces us to determine more clearly what is the
necessary condition for a state change. This could eventually allow the
abstraction of the qapi_event_send_migration() to a higher
layer. Something like:

void qmp_migrate() {
    t:migrate=true
    
    migration_setup() :: do setup, mig_setup_done=true
    migration_advance_state() :: checks the triggers, changes state and
                                 sends the event

    migration_start() :: migrate, mig_done=true
                         failure, mig_failed=true
                         etc
    migration_advance_state()

    migrate_vmstate() :: device state migration, mig_device_done=true
    migration_advance_state()

 etc..
}

IOW, we could do a better job of separating what is work, what is
migration control flow, what is error handling, etc.

Looks good, not sure if the actual migration flow would fit this, but
let's assume it would.

What I'm trying to convey is that we have:

1) events API that needs to be kept stable, this list of states that
   libvirt sees and at what moments we emit them.

2) MigrationStatus being used as an internal record of the current
   (loosely defined) migration phase. This is "arbitrary", hence we're
   discussing adding a new MigrationStatus "just" to make sure we don't
   start a new migration at the wrong moment.

I'm trying to understand if you want to cover 1, 2 or both.

I would suggest we first take all of the internal tracking, i.e. #2, the
"if (state==MIGRATION_STATUS)" code and convert them to use some other
state tracking, either the triggers as you suggest, or random booleans
sprinkled all over, it's not immediately important.

Once that is done, then we could freeze the #1, MigrationStatus. It
would only change whenever we wanted to change the API and that should
be a well documented change.

Ok, maybe I'm splittling hairs here, I was trying to understand whether
all of these "if (s->state ...)" have the same semantics.

a) For cases such as CANCELLING: that could be a simple
   s->trigger[MIGRATE_CANCEL]=1.

  (we're not removing the CANCELLING state due to the API stability, but
  still)

b) For error conditions: s->event[FAILED]=1, then (possibly at a later
   point in migration_change_state):

   if (s->event[FAILED] && !s->trigger[MIGRATE_CANCEL]) {
      migrate_set_state(s->state, MIGRATION_STATUS_FAILED);
   }

b) For postcopy resume/pause, etc, maybe an actual state machine that can
   only be in one state would be helpful.

c) For "we reached this point, so set this state", most of those could
   just be an invocation to migration_change_state() and, as you
   suggest, that would look for the evidence elsewhere to know what
   state to set:

   if (s->trigger[MIGRATE] && s->event[COMPLETED]) {
      migrate_set_state(s->state, MIGRATION_STATUS_COMPLETED);
   }
