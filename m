I understand the problem behind spending more minutes on this.

However, looking at our CI, we already duplicate functional testing a lot:
buildtest.yml:functional-system-alpine:
buildtest.yml:functional-system-ubuntu:
buildtest.yml:functional-system-debian:
buildtest.yml:functional-system-fedora:
buildtest.yml:functional-system-centos:
buildtest.yml:functional-system-opensuse:

Would that hurt so much to have one configuration enabled with ubsan and 
asan, which catches *real* bugs, and potential security issues?
Yes, it adds overhead, but it should not be x10. Around x2 to x3.

On github running, running -j2, running all functional tests with 
sanitizers takes less than 1 hour, and the build takes the same amount 
in time (-j2 as well). Hopefully we have more cores available on our own 
runners.

Yes, I run with ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0, and I deactivate any test 
that is flaky.

Two of them related to asan are tcg tests:
- munmap-pthread
- follow-fork-mode
I didn't have time to investigate, so I just removed them in my tree.

At this point, this whole list of tests concerned is:

It's always said that "Maintainer time is precious", shouldn't that be 
CI job to catch this?
I guess CI minutes are cheaper than engineer ones those days.
