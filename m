Different distributions will have different opinions.
In case we decide one day (which is *not* short term future) to replace 
existing binaries with a single one, it's probably a discussion that 
will happen.

My personal "anticipation" is that if we unify all targets in a single 
binary (which is not happening tomorrow), distributions can always 
create a qemu-system-common package, and depend on it for all targets.
Thus, every qemu-system-X will simply include the expected symlink (or 
wrapper script, or whatever) to the single binary.
Or they can recompile the single binary for every subpackage they want 
in case they want to absolutely reduce the code size for a single 
target, even though the sum of binaries will be infinitely bigger than 
using the single one.
In any case, it's not something that will happen soon, except if 
everyone in the community becomes convinced of the advantage of building 
QEMU as a single binary, instead of per target binaries.

Even if this never converges, there are still benefits left for what is 
done right now:
- Faster multi targets build: less compilation units == less time.
- Smaller multi targets build footprint: seems relevant as disk space on 
GitLab CI is a recurrent complaint.
- Clarification of code: I hope C developers are objectively (i.e. not 
personal preference) convinced that less ifdef soup is better.

Sure.

Maybe there is a misunderstanding, but at this point, we are not trying 
to invent anything new. We are just looking for a way to build QAPI 
generated code only once, so it's possible to link together object files 
coming from two different targets.

My mistake was to not mention introspection in the cover letter, but 
thanks to Markus and Daniel, I understood the consequences of that, and 
my position is to keep the current schema and serialization methods 
*exactly* as they are, so consumers don't see any change. The only place 
where we need to do changes are scripts/qapi and qapi/.
