Series a bit of tangled up, I'd suggest splitting it in 3 separate
series that would follow up each other, to make it more digestible
and that should simplify/speedup review and merging processes.

here is suggested order (1 and 2 could be swapped or done in parallel):

1: introduce power state infrastructure (hw one as opposed to administrativ=
e one)
   and apply it to ARM vcpus.
   (on completion guest should be able to power up/down cores using exiting
    linux interfaces (which I'd guess end up in calling PSCI))

2. Instead of complicating =E2=80=98-smp=E2=80=99 semantics and as conseque=
nce trying to deal
    with complications it causes (-deviceset CLI option),
    I=E2=80=99d suggest to make =E2=80=98-device arm-cpu=E2=80=99 work, tha=
t way
    =E2=80=98-smp=E2=80=99 semantics stay the same
    and you don=E2=80=99t have to invent -deviceset CLI option to fixup bui=
lt in CPUs.

    What I see in this series has a number of problems wrt to above:
    2.1: -smp creates anonymous vcpus that aren=E2=80=99t supposed to be ma=
naged by user,
         as opposed to devices created by -device, which must have user ass=
igned  =E2=80=98id=E2=80=99
         if they are to be managed by the user.
    2.2. to workaround that, series adds to =E2=80=98-deviceset/device-set=
=E2=80=99 that lets
         pattern match vcpus by some subset of device properties. Thus viol=
ating #1 point.

    Above can be solved by using existing =E2=80=98-device=E2=80=99 that wo=
uld allow to set
    initial power state during vcpu creation time and let user assign =E2=
=80=98id=E2=80=99
    if one wishes to manage that vcpu later on.
    That alleviates the need for -deviceset accessing anonymous vcpus.
    And remaining device-set QMP command would have user provided =E2=80=98=
id=E2=80=99 to address
    managed vcpus.
    i.e. UI will be consistent with what we do in x86/s390/spapr cases,
    as well as with any other devices that supports '-device'

3. As the last would come series to support administrative power state poli=
cy
   aka =E2=80=98hotplug-like=E2=80=99 feature (incl. device-set QMP command=
).


Also:
Looking at previous reviews, lazy-realize issue still hasn=E2=80=99t been d=
ropped.
It=E2=80=99s a hack to workaround slowness of VCPU creation code and
I still maintain the opinion that it doesn't fit this series.
(it actually gets in the way of the =E2=80=98hotplug-like=E2=80=99 feature,
negatively influencing/complicating this series).

If faster vcpu creation times are needed, fix relevant code instead of
covering it up with a hack. (in previous reviews I've even pointed to
some low hanging fruits that can speed it up).
Anyways speed up optimizations should be a separate series and
shouldn't be conflated with this series at all.

=E2=80=98Parking=E2=80=99 was KVM concept due to inability to destroy VCPUs=
 on KVM side.
Please do not use/propagate/expose it to newer code (unless it's KVM relate=
d).
In absence of lazy-realize it's likely not needed, as parking is only
related to unrealize in KVM context.

> (*) We do not migrate disabled vCPUs

I=E2=80=99d migrate disabled vcpus as well (at least power state), while it=
 would consume time,
It would be in line with what we do with other present devices.
We can always reduce what we migrate later on as a patch on top if necessar=
y.

I guess that concludes my review of this revision.

PS:
I don't think that per patch review at this state would make much sense
as the things patches do are all mixed up and some of that should go away,
drastically changing next revision.
But given the series is complete rewrite, it's expected and allows
to identify how to ammend the following series.

> A. Physical Limitation to Support CPU Hotplug: (Architectural Constraint)
>=20
>    1. ARMv8 CPU architecture does not support the concept of the physical=
 CPU
>       hotplug.=20
>       a. There are many per-CPU components like PMU, SVE, MTE, Arch timer=
s, etc.,
>          whose behavior needs to be clearly defined when the CPU is
>          hot(un)plugged. Current specification does not define this nor a=
re any
>          immediate plans from ARM to extend support for such a feature.
>    2. Other ARM components like GIC, etc., have not been designed to real=
ize
>       physical CPU hotplug capability as of now. For example,
>       a. Every physical CPU has a unique GICC (GIC CPU Interface) by cons=
truct.
>          Architecture does not specify what CPU hot(un)plug would mean in
>          context to any of these.
>       b. CPUs/GICC are physically connected to unique GICR (GIC Redistrib=
utor).
>          GIC Redistributors are always part of the always-on power domain=
. Hence,
>          they cannot be powered off as per specification.
>=20
> B. Limitation in Firmware/ACPI (Architectural Constraint)
>=20
>    1. Firmware has to expose GICC, GICR, and other per-CPU features like =
PMU,
>       SVE, MTE, Arch Timers, etc., to the OS. Due to the architectural co=
nstraint
>       stated in section A1(a), all interrupt controller structures of
>       MADT describing GIC CPU Interfaces and the GIC Redistributors MUST =
be
>       presented by firmware to the OSPM during boot time.
>    2. Architectures that support CPU hotplug can evaluate the ACPI _MAT m=
ethod
>       to get this kind of information from the firmware even after boot, =
and the
>       OSPM has the capability to process these. ARM kernel uses informati=
on in
>       MADT interrupt controller structures to identify the number of pres=
ent CPUs
>       during boot and hence does not allow to change these after boot. Th=
e number

t!

> C. Limitations in KVM to Support Virtual CPU Hotplug (Architectural Const=

time
>          and cannot be changed later after initialization has happened.
>          KVM statically configures these resources based on the number of=
 vCPUs
>          and the number/size of redistributor ranges.
>       b. Association between vCPU and its VGIC redistributor is fixed at =
the
>          VM init time within the KVM, i.e., when redistributor iodevs gets
>          registered. VGIC does not allow to setup/change this association
>          after VM initialization has happened. Physically, every CPU/GICC=
 is
>          uniquely connected with its redistributor, and there is no
>          architectural way to set this up.
>    2. KVM vCPUs:
>       a. Lack of specification means destruction of KVM vCPUs does not ex=
ist as
>          there is no reference to tell what to do with other per-vCPU
>          components like redistributors, arch timer, etc.
>       b. In fact, KVM does not implement the destruction of vCPUs for any
>          architecture. This is independent of whether the architecture

when

possible
