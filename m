Is that true? It seems that virglrenderer uses builds without minigbm 
support to run tests on GitLab CI.

Anyway, if there is any variance in the build procedure, that may 
justify having a separate build instruction in QEMU tree to avoid 
confusion. Otherwise, it's better to have a documentation shared with 
other VMMs.

It will be some burden in the future. Now you are adding this 
documentation just for QEMU, but crosvm and libkrun may gain similar 
documentation. The DRM native context support for Intel and Asahi is in 
development, and I guess nvk will support it someday.

So, a very rough estimation of future documentation updates will be:
(number of VMMs) * (number of DRM native contexts in development)
= 3 * 3
= 9

That's manageable but suboptimal.
