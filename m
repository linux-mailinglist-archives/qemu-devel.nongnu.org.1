>=20I can disable plugins and do that normally but that does not help tho=
se who get QEMU from their distro (i.e. most users). If this infrastructu=
re was disabled in default builds and needed an explicit option to enable=
 then those who need it could enable it and not imposed it on everyone el=
se who just get a default build from a distro and never use plugins. Havi=
ng an option which needs rebuild is like not having the option for most p=
eople. I guess the question is which is the larger group? Those who just =
run guests or those who use this instrumentation with plugins.

Hard to say.

> The default may better be what the larger group needs. Even then distro=
s may still change the default so it would be best if the overhead can be=
 minimised even if enabled. I think the log infrastructure does that, wou=
ld a similar solution work here?
>=20
>=20For testing I've found that because embedded PPC CPUs have a software=
 controlled MMU (and in addition to that QEMU may flush TLB entries too o=
ften) running something that does a lot of memory access like runnung the=
 STREAM benchmark on sam460ex is hit by this IIRC but anything else causi=
ng a lot of interrupts like reading from emulated disk or sound is probab=
ly affected as well. I've tried to optimise PPC exception handling a bit =
before but whenever I optimise something it is later undone by other chan=
ges not caring about performance.

I could try running the benchmark on multiple versions:

* qemu with plugins disabled,
* with plugins enabled but without these patches and
* with plugins enabled and with these patches.

However, I'll likely only report back with results next week, though.
Do you happen to have an image you can point me to? Either something
that has the benchmark already or some unixoid running on the platform?
I'm currently not motivated enough to cook up some bare-metal testbed
for a platform I'm not familiar with.

Regards,
Julian
