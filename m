This code was never really intended for execution at EL2, but it
happened to work, partially because TCG's lack of strict alignment
checking when the MMU is off.

Those assumptions no longer hold, so yes, let's get this fixed properly.

Given VHE and nested virt (which will likely imply VHE in practice), I
would like to extend this functionality (i.e., the use of preliminary
page tables in NOR flash) to EL2 as well, but with VHE enabled. This
means we can still elide TLB maintenance (and BBM checks) by using
different ASIDs, and otherwise, fall back to entering with the MMU off
if VHE is not available. In that case, we should enforce strict
alignment too, so that needs to be fixed regardless.

I'll try to code something up and send it round. In the mean time,
feel free to propose a minimal patch that reinstates the strict
alignment if you are pressed for time, and I'll merge it right away.
