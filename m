Downstream versions do not map cleanly to individual upstream versions
across the whole code base. If we have two distinct features in upstream
version X, each of them may map to a different downstream release. 

This can happen when downstream skips one or more upstream releases.
One feature from the skipped release might be backported to an earlier
downstream release, while other feature might not arrive downstream
until they later rebase. Version based checks are an inherantly
undesirable idea for a situation where there is any backporting taking
place, whether its machine type versions or something else. Named feature
/ flag based checks are always the way to go.


With regards,
Daniel
