Unfortunately, we cannot expect everyone runs Linux, and the offload 
features are provided by Linux. However, QEMU can run on other 
platforms, and offload features may be provided by vhost-user or vhost-vdpa.

"[PATCH v3 0/5] virtio-net: Convert feature properties to OnOffAuto" 
adds "x-force-features-auto" compatibility property to virtio-net for 
this purpose:

With no-cross-migrate=ON + uso=OFF, no-cross-migrate will set uso=auto, 
but the user overrides with uso=off. As the consequence, USO will be 
disabled but all other available offload features will be enabled.
