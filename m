Hi Eric,

Thanks for the feedback. I've rebased the patch series onto the latest 
master and pushed it to a branch as you requested.

Interestingly, the rebase completed cleanly without any conflicts on my 
end, so I'm not sure what the initial issue might have been. In any 
case, this branch should be up-to-date.


You can find the updated branch here for review:

- [v1-rebased] 
https://github.com/hnusdr/qemu/tree/secure-smmu-v1-community-newer


For historical reference, the original branch is here.

- 
[v1-original]  https://github.com/hnusdr/qemu/tree/secure-smmu-v1-community


Thanks,

Tao
