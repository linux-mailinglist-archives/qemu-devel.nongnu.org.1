I choose to expand all the types inline in events & commands
because I felt like this gives a more convenient API design
for applications, without the extra indirectino of packing
and unpacking parameters
.

Yep, it would complicate docs to have to unpack it against the
method. I was coming at this from the POV of an application
developer though, intentionally ignoring what is the most
convenient for the code generator. The latter is fixed cost
while writing the generator, while the API design is an ongoing
cost time, so makes more sense to optimize for the latter.

Yep, hiding everything behind a struct can reduce breakage.

The tricky (impossible) question is how beneficial it is in
the real world usage ?

As guidance, taking protobuf as a commonly used package though,
if I look at Kubevirt's protobuf generated APIs:

  https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/blob/main/pkg/handler-launcher-com/cmd/v1/cmd.pb.go#L1237

I can see they're using structs for parameters and return
values. So that widely used prior art, suggests we go the
way you outline and use structs.

Yes, if the goal of using structs is to reduce breakage when
fields are added/removed, then IMHO the logical conclusion
is that empty structs must be generated.
