Yep, even on x86 we don't add named models for every conceivable
CPU SKU variant, just one so called "typical" variant for a given
microarchiteture level [1].

The vendor independent Arm CPU spec versions are a good enough
match for typical real world silicon, then it would make sense
to focus mostly on such named CPU models, not try to make an
exhaustive definition of every vendor's impl. I could see there
might be some exceptions where adding a vendor specific named
model would be worthwhile, but hopefully that'd be relatively
uncommon and   -cpu Armv8.6,+feat1,+feat2 would be sufficient.

eg toggling 1/2/3 extra features to precise match a vendor's
named mode is ok, but adding 20-30 extra features get a match
is painful. That's the kind of rule of thumb that could be
used when deciding whether its worth adding a vendor specific
named model, vs relying on the generic spec based models.

With regards,
Daniel

[1] we do have CPU model versions, as a way to "bugfix" our
    CPU definitions.
