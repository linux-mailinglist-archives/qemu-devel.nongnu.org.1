I'm running packer, and with a qcow2 source image sized at 75000MB (but
only 5GB on disk) when it runs "qemu-img resize ... 75000MB" it takes about
10 seconds on my system. I guess it's not reading the whole disk since me
nvme isn't that fast, but it's a non-trivial amount of work. It also runs a
qemu-img convert call (again, from qcow2 to qcow2) that seems more like a
cp, and that takes the same 10 seconds on my system.

Yes, this is a no-op, but it reads the entire disk image to perform that
no-op, so this is merely a time-saving improvement, not a behavior change.


Can you give more context on what exactly you're doing that it reads the
entire disk image just to resize it? This sounds completely unexpected
and if it does, there may be a different problem to be solved.

In my test, for a raw image, I see a single ftruncate() call, which is
unnecessary, but shouldn't cause any measurable time difference for the
qemu-img run. qcow2 has a little more code in QEMU to figure out that
there is nothing to do, but it doesn't involve any syscall and certainly
not reading the whole image.

SMTP settings). By that time, I forgot and thought this patch was short
enough to not warrant much of a commit message.

The main practical advantage is for users that call "qemu-img resize" via
scripts or other systems (like Packer in my case) that don't check the
image
size ahead of time. I can upstream this change into them (by using
"qemu-img info =E2=80=94output=3Djson ...") but I figured it would be usefu=
l to more
users here.

This could trivially be added to block/io.c:bdrv_co_truncate(), as well as
blockdev.c:qmp_block_resize() with a little more work. I'm not familiar
with those workflows, but if needed I can do that as well.

Here's the new patch:

Subject: [PATCH] Skip resizing image to the same size

Higher-level software, such as Packer, blindly call "qemu-img resize"
even when the size is the same. This change can be pushed to those
users, but it's very cheap to check and can save many other users more
time here.

I don't think this is necessary: the actual operation is a no-op
anyway, there's no need to special-case it.

Please also refrain from changing qemu-img until my refresh
patchset is either accepted or rejected. It was a large work
and it'd be sad to lose it.
