We do not need a dedicated section for notes. By eliminating a specially
parsed section, these notes can be treated as normal rST paragraphs in
the new QMP reference manual, and can be placed and styled much more
flexibly.

Update the QAPI parser to now prohibit special "Note" sections while
suggesting a new syntax.

The exact formatting to use is a matter of taste, but a good candidate
is simply:

.. note:: lorem ipsum ...

but there are other choices, too. The Sphinx readthedocs theme offers
theming for the following forms (capitalization unimportant); all are
adorned with a (!) symbol in the title bar for rendered HTML docs.

These are rendered in orange:

.. Attention:: ...
.. Caution:: ...
.. WARNING:: ...

These are rendered in red:

.. DANGER:: ...
.. Error:: ...

These are rendered in green:

.. Hint:: ...
.. Important:: ...
.. Tip:: ...

These are rendered in blue:

.. Note:: ...
.. admonition:: custom title

   admonition body text

This patch uses ".. notes::" almost everywhere, with just two "caution"
directives. ".. admonition:: notes" is used in a few places where we had
an ordered list of multiple notes.
