I still don't see the point, because it already works without these 
changes. With current master one can specify -audiodev for -M paegasos2 
and it gives a warning but does the right thing and sets the audiodev for 
via-ac97. I think the warning can be avoided by using -global to set the 
via-ac97 audiodev property but since it picks up the -audiodev there's no 
need to. Apart from the warning this is convenient for the user, what's 
proposed in this series seems less so. What is the issue this series tries 
to solve?
