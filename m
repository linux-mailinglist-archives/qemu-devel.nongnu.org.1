The comment at the beginning of qdev.c says "ide bus support" but a lot of 
functions in it have ide_dev prefix. Maybe this comes from the original 
qdev-ification of this code and then adding some more unrelated parts in 
this file. It's clearly beyond scope of this patch to clean all this but 
since you're changing it maybe this is a good opportunity to reduce the 
mess a bit. I'm OK with renaming qdev.c to ide-dev.c or qdev-ide.c or 
whatever else as long as it's clear that the header belongs to the c file.

I've missed that so besides files directly including internal.h there 
could be others using some stuff from it through pci.h so this makes it 
more difficult to untangle.

My comment was only that if you make changes then do it in a way that 
leaves the possibility to move stuff here to clean the current situation 
but if you can also do some of it now that's even better but not required.
