I actually wonder if we should give the vvfat option a different name to
make it less error prone. Forgetting format=vvfat is easy and then raw
will be autodetected and size will be interpreted as an option for raw.

The order is the other way around. You always get the protocol level
openen first and only then the image format level.

Imagine the simple case of a qcow2 image file used for the VM. You get
things stacked like this:

        virtio-blk
            |
            v
          qcow2
            |
            v
          file

You need to open them from bottom to top. Opening a qcow2 image must be
able to read from the file, so first the file layer must be opened. And
obvious a virtio-blk device can only use the image after the qcow2
layered has been opened.

In your case, this is raw over vvfat. vvfat gets opened first, and then
raw gets instantiated on top of it. (If you use format=vvfat, then the
raw layer is left away.)

Top level options you give to -drive go to the topmost block driver. You
should be able to still set it on the vvfat level with -drive
format=raw,file.size=... Deciding which option goes to which node is
part of the (rather complicated) bdrv_open() logic in block.c.

What raw does when a size option is given is that it just truncates the
lower level to the given size. So as vvfat doesn't know the size, it
still creates a 504 MB image, but raw shows only the first part of it to
the guest. This results not only in an invalid partition table, but also
means that as soon as vvfat decides to put a cluster after your limited
size, you'll see filesystem corruption in the guest.

So your approach to deal with this in vvfat and create a smaller
filesystem to start with does look right to me.
