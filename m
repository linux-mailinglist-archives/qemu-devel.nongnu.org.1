I was waiting for Alistair's ACK on the smcntrpmf series as he had some
comments. It looks like he is okay
with the series now (no further questions).  Let me respin both the series.

Your suggested approach looks good to me. But I was asking about concerns
about enabling these extensions
by default rather than the actual mechanism to implement it. Few of the
extensions listed here such as smstateen,smcsrind
sscsrind are independent ISA extensions which are used for other ISA
extensions as well.

It looks like you are okay with the use case also ?

Not sure what you mean here. What does 'max' cpu have to do with pmu
extensions ?
