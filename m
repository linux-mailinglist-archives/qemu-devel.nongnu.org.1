This is about QEMU/KVM emulating certain Hyper-V version, not about
guest Hyper-V version. To be honest, I'm not sure what was the last
version of Hyper-V which was exposing HV_SYSTEM_RESET_RECOMMENDED. I
don't have anything older that WS2016 around now and the bit is not
there. If I'm not mistaken, it was already missing in 2012R2. I would
appreciate if anyone has more precise historical info to add here.

Np, if I am to re-send this I'll add these (hope it's not an acceptance
blocker, we can always do a follow-up).

Hyper-V is a role you can enable in various Windows versions, both
server and client. When enabled, you get a hypervisor (which is called
'Microsoft Hypervisor' as I was told) and your Windows becomes the root
partition (similar to Xen Dom0). In case you run this on KVM, Windows
becomes L2. Hyper-V enlightenments provided by KVM/QEMU are consumed by
the hypervisor then.

Note: Hyper-V role is optional, in many cases Windows guests run without
it (no Hyper-V VMs, no WSL2, ...) and thus consume KVM's Hyper-V
enlightenments directly, no nested virt involved.
