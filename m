Code being useful is not enough.  We must have people to maintain it
adequately.  This has not been the case for COLO in years.

Deprecating a feature with intent to remove it is not a death sentence.
It's a *suspended* death sentence: if somebody steps up to maintain it,
we can revert the deprecation, or extend the grace period to give them a
chance.

I think we should deprecate COLO now to send a clear distress signal.
The deprecation notice should explain it doesn't work, and will be
removed unless people step up to fix it and to maintain it.  This will
ensure progress one way or the other.  Doing nothing now virtually
ensures we'll have the same discussion again later.

"Broken for two releases without anyone noticing" and "maintainer absent
for more than four years" doesn't exacltly inspire hope, though.  We
should seriously consider removing it right away.

Lukas, can you give us hope?
