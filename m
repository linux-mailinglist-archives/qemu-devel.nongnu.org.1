FWIW, in response to your previous mail, I had suggested to Peter Xu in
private that he would make a good candidate of co-maintainer for migration,
given he is already a nominated reviewer and has been actively reviewing
migration patches for a long while.

Migration did have 2 maintainers until earlier in this year when David
Gilbert moved on to other things, and I think we can all see that this
has had an unfortunate impact on productivity in the migration subsystem
that needs to be solved.

With regards,
Daniel
