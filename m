I meant to imply it when discussing when admonition was used, but yeah.

Eh. we got enough commits. I think it's helpful to keep the whole
conversion in one giant bang so that the diff is helpful in illustrating
all of the different types of conversions.

(In fact, even though I split out Example conversion for your sake in
review, I think it'd be helpful to squash them together on merge for the
same exact reason.)

Let's just amend the commit message.

Would you take a patch adjusting the indent later, or will you then tell me
it's not worth the git blame fuzz? :)
