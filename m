This isn't for the single binary effort, there we are taking a
lot of care to not introduce any change.

This is for after it; once we have a single binary (one architecture
run by an instance) we can start testing heterogeneous emulation
(different architectures in the same instance).

VirtIO 0.9 needs knowledge of the vCPU architecture to get its
endianness. So we need to somehow propagate that at creation
time, guarantying which vCPU (or set of vCPUs) will access a
virtio device.

The use case I'd like to figure out is how should we model
plugging a virtio 0.9 device in into a fully emulated
ZynqMP machine, which has little-endian ARM cores and big
endian MicroBlaze cores.

Alex said this is unlikely to happen, and better is to
ignore this case by not allowing virtio pre-1.0 devices in
our future heterogeneous emulator.

In this same thread Pierrick pointed me to the reference in
the spec: '2.4.3 Legacy Interfaces: A Note on Virtqueue Endianness',
"It is assumed that the host is already aware of the guest endian."

I suppose this means a pre-1.0 virtio device expect to be used by
a single guest OS, but it is not clear the guest OS as fixed
endianness, because the code path checks vCPU endianness at
runtime, so passing guest endianness as a property to pre-1.0
devices isn't really an option.

Anyway I think 1/ I posted this too early, "speculating" as Pierrick
noticed, and confuse the community w.r.t. "single binary" and
2/ I don' t understand legacy virtio and its endianness handling
enough to figure a clever idea to keep using it heterogeneous
setup, so I'll let this task to someone more familiar with that tech.

OK. I won't pursue in this direction. I apologize for mentioning
this topic again too early.
