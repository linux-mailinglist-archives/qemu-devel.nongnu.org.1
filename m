I think my notes about clone are a red herring for vfork
specifically. For vfork in the child, the vfork spec requires
a very minimal amount of stuff to happen in the child, but QEMU's
own TCG data structures and calls and processes mean that we
will be doing a lot more than the guest does. For instance,
we need to return from the function that called vfork, so we
can continue to execute the guest code. And the guest code will
likely call into the translator to generate more code, which will
(a) mess up the TCG data structures for the parent and (b)
probably result in our calling into libc functions that aren't
OK to call.

More generally, AIUI glibc expects that it has control over what's
happening with threads, so it can set up its own data structures
for the new thread (e.g. for TLS variables). This email from the
glibc mailing list is admittedly now two decades old
https://public-inbox.org/libc-alpha/200408042007.i74K7ZOr025380@magilla.sf.=
frob.com/
but it says:

# Basically, if you want to call libc functions you should do it from a
# thread that was set up by libc or libpthread.  i.e., if you make your own
# threads with clone, only call libc functions from the initial thread.

The problem is that the guest glibc is using CLONE_VFORK in
a particular way for performance reasons on real hardware,
which is valid for real kernel CLONE_VFORK but which our
lack of accuracy in emulation means we mishandle, causing the
guest to fall over. The actual performance under QEMU isn't
important.
