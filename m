Thank you for your answer.

Overcommitting for the build is safe, but in my experience the positive 
effect is typically very small on modern hosts with fast disk I/O and 
large buffer caches.

And there is also a negative impact because this requires scheduling 
with process switches.

Therefore I am not so sure that overcommitting is a good idea, 
especially not on cloud servers where the jobs are running in VMs.

I did not run tests in my GitLab fork because I still have to figure out 
how to do that.

In my initial answer to Peter's mail I had described my tests and the 
test environment in detail.

My test environment was an older (= slow) VM with 4 cores. I tested with 
different values for --num-processes. As expected higher values raised 
the number of timeouts. And the most interesting result was that 
`--num-processes 1` avoided timeouts, used less CPU time and did not 
increase the duration.

The TCI job terminates after less than 7 minutes in my test runs with 
less parallelism.

Obviously there are tests which already do their own multithreading, and 
maybe other tests run single threaded. So maybe we need different values 
for `--num-processes` depending on the number of threads which the 
single tests use?

Stefan

We need to find the balance between avoiding timeouts, while having
