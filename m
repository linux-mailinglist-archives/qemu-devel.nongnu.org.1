I recently wanted to check for some changes that I did to the URI handling
in the block layer code, but I had to discover that a lot of iotests only
work with the raw file format when using a protocol that is not "file",
i.e. "./check -ssh -qcow2" shows a lot of failures.
While some tests could be fixed to work with the "ssh" protocol, too,
many other tests seem to be written for the "file" protocol only and
thus have to be marked accordingly.

After applying these patches, there is still one failure left in test 181
where I'm unsure whether it's a real bug or whether this test should also
simply be marked to work with the "file" protocol only. Suggestions are
welcome!
