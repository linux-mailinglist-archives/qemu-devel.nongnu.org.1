We explicitly did not want to rely on the senders to do this, as the
senders generally does not know what receiving QEMU wants to do with
the FDs.

Clearing the non-blocking flag was chosen to make the default state of
passed-in FDs, be identical to the default state of FDs that QEMU opens
itself. This removes the possibility of bugs we've seen in the past,
where code assumed an FD's blocking flag was in its default state you
get from 'socket()' and then broke when receiving a pre-opened FD
over QEMU in a different state.  Basically anything using SocketAddress
should be getting an FD in the same state whether opened by QEMU or
passed in.

Primarily this is relevant to the monitor QMP/HMP, which in turns
makes it is relevant to UNIX chardevs. There are a number of other
areas in QEMU calling qio_channel_readv_full() with a non-NULL fds
argument though.
