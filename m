I think hiding a command's results behind a link is roughly as bad as
hiding its arguments behind a link.

It's not about hiding type names.  Sure, type names are not ABI, since
there's nothing the user can do with them.  But as long as that's
understood, they can be useful in documentation.  We use them as text
for links to and a title for the documentation of a type.

Messing with type names affects link texts and titles in documentation,
which is fine.

If you want namespace support to keep QMP and QGA apart, go for it.

If it's just for full QMP vs. qemu-storage-daemon QMP, I suggest to
ignore the issue for now.

Yes.

The type's doc comment is then no longer fit for generating standalone
documentation for the type, only for generating inlined documentation.

Or a type is used both in a position where its documentation is to be
inlined, and a position where it isn't.  The latter requires us to
generate standalone documentation for the type, so we can link to it.

Whether this is a problem in practice I can't say.
