Indeed, I had forgotten about that usage. So that's a case where
mapped-ram does the right thing. Now I can forget about it again =)

For enabling mapped-ram generically at this point I think we don't have
much choice but to introduce a new version of read_ramblock_mapped_ram()
that writes zero pages. It would need to discriminate the zero pages,
(instead of doing a big copy of a bunch of pages) so we could avoid
copying a page that's already zero. In fact, if we do that, it would
already work without further changes. The performance of -loadvm would
leave something to be improved, but we could tackle that later.

What do you think?

If we decide we need to explicitly select that new code, I don't think
we need any new capability, because the user has no choice in it. We
know that loadvm needs it, but -loadvm doesn't, any other sort of
mapped-ram migration also doesn't need it. There is some discussion to
be had on whether we want to bind it to the commands themselves, or do
some form of detection of clean ram. I think it's best we postopone this
part of the discussion until Peter is back (next week), so we can have
more eyes on it.

I used "zero page handling" as "a policy on how to deal with zero
pages", similarly to the zero-page-detection option.

The page is being zeroed because it was dirty (on your dirty bitmap) not
because some policy determined that it needs to be zeroed. IOW, it seems
your solution doesn't need to have any knowledge of whether the whole
memory is supposed to be zeroed (as discussed above), the presence of a
dirty bitmap already selects which pages are restored and if there's a 1
for that page in the bitmap, then we don't really care what's in the
file_bmap.

If we implement generic snapshot + mapped-ram + zero page then you could
probably simply OR your dirty bitmap on top of the file_bmap.

Does that makes sense? I might be missing something, I'm looking at a
bunch of threads before going on vacation.
