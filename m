KVM can use any named CPU.

When I first wrote this I though it would be as simple as checknig a
CPUID feature flag. That appears to not be the case, however, as Linux
is just checking for various CPU models directly. With that in mind
perhaps we should just check of the guest CPU model vendor
== CPUID_VENDOR_INTEL and leave it at that.

eg, create an error if running an AMD CPU such as $QEMU -cpu EPYC

With regards,
Daniel
