"s" profiles mandate all the "u" profile mandatory extensions. For example
6.2.2 says

"""
The RVA22S64 mandatory unprivileged extensions include all the mandatory unprivileged
extensions in RVA22U64.
"""

I'm guessing any platform which wants to advertise that it's compliant
with a profile will update its hardware descriptions to ensure all the
profile's mandatory extensions are presented. But, I think I understand
your concern. If somebody is parsing the ISA string as way to determine
if the platform is compliant with a profile, then they may get a false
negative due to the ISA string missing a newly named feature. I'm not
sure how much of a problem that will be in practice, though, since testing
for profile compliance, just for the sake of it, doesn't seem very useful.
Software really only needs to know which extensions are available and if
it's an old feature that got newly named, then software likely already
has another way of detecting it.

Yes, there's a handful of these messy things and the first profiles
expose them since they're trying to define them. Fingers crossed that
the next profiles won't have to name old features. FWIW, I at least
don't see any "This is a new extension name for this feature" notes in
the RVA23 profile.
