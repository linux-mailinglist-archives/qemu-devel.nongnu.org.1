Sounds reasonable.

I think the benefit is just code clarity. I think a function returning
with a different lock state that it is called with generally is not
desirable if it can be avoided.

qemu_init() caller just releasing locks immediately doesn't really serve
a benefit. A comment can be added to say that when qemu_init() returns,
bql is not held and CPUs may be running. This would be the same for any
configuration of background thread or not.

I don't want to bikeshed it too much, if you prefer not to move it. It is
nly one specialized case. Adding some comments about the purpose of the
locks is more important than if you release them here or in the callee.

Thanks,
Nick
