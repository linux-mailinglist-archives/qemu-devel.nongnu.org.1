It would greatly help if we could merge some of your testsuite under QEMU.

oh. I didn't realize that :/ I guess we only tested our own scenario when
we were working on the ast2600 bringup.

I think the change in the reset handler should be :

-    size -= sd_bootpart_offset(sd);
+    if (sd_is_emmc(sd)) {
+        size -= sd->boot_part_size * 2;
+    }


Thanks,

C.
