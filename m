Those are for debugging only, so we shouldn't suggest them to be used in
production.. at least not the plan.

Yeah, handshake would make it work.  But it's not yet there.. :(

Ahh yes, the HUP works with this case too, that's OK.

What's your thoughts in the other email I wrote?  That'll make QMP
available in general on dest, if I read it right.  But yeah I think this
issue is not a blocker now at least, so I'm just curious whether that's
still useful.

We may still want to understand one question I raised elsewhere on whether
cpr state save/load must be done during vm stopped.  If so, then it means
Libvirt will only go with "defer", and QMP set-capabilities might be
accounted as downtime there which can be unfortunate.. Basically, it means
if we can still drop patch 4 completely (while the vhost notifiers can
exist in the future, but hopefully not dependent on patch 4).
