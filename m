I guess you mean the table labeled "Figure: Full two-entries descriptor tab=
le".

Take into account that the descriptor table is not the state of all
the descriptors. That information must be maintained by the device and
the driver internally.

The descriptor table is used as a circular buffer, where one part is
writable by the driver and the other part is writable by the device.
For the device to override the descriptor table entry where descriptor
id 0 used to be does not mean that the descriptor id 0 is used. It
just means that the device communicates to the driver that descriptor
1 is used, and both sides need to keep the descriptor state
coherently.

I think you got it right. Please let me know if you have further questions.

If one side disables notification it needs to check the indexes or the
flags by its own means: Timers, read the memory in a busy loop, etc.

Sorry for the late reply!
