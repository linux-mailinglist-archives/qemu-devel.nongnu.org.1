OK, thanks.

So is it a migration compatibility issue that you care (migrating VMs from
your old downstream binary to new downstream binary should always succeed),
or perhaps you care more on making sure the features you wanted, i.e., you
want to make sure some specific devices that you care will have the
properties that you expect?

I think compat properties are mostly used for migration purposes, but
indeed it can also be used to keep old behaviors of devices, even if the
migration could succed with/without such a compat property entry.

If it's about migration, I'd like to know whether vmstate-static-checker.py
could also help your case (under scripts/), perhaps in a better way,
because it directly observes the VMSD structures (which is the ultimate
form on wire, after all these compat properties applied to the devices).

If it's not about migration, then maybe it's more QOM-relevant, and if so I
don't have a strong opinion. It seems still make some sense to have a tool
simply dump the QOM tree for a machine type with all properties and compare
them between machines with some binaries.  For that I'll leave that to
Markus to decide.

Btw, I tried to apply the patches and build, but failed:

There also seems to have an assumption that QEMU is built under "build/" in
the script.

+default_qemu_binary = 'build/qemu-system-x86_64'
