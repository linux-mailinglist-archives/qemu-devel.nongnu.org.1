Neither, this was found by code inspection. I was just curious about how
VMM would interact with hypervisor to expose features to the guest. Docs
at https://developer.apple.com/documentation/hypervisor are not that
detailed (I may need to read further ;-) ).

P.S., I verified on M1 that ID_AA64PFR1_EL1 is 0x20 at
hvf_arm_get_host_cpu_features() stage and is overwritten as 0x0 later
w/o this patch, which indicates the (guest visible) feature ID registers
are "writable" to some extent.
