I use 'tig blame <file>' to dig change history.

> I am upstreaming other peoples work  that was done over the last couple of years so it hard to tell.  Also,  the original xive support was only complete enough to support Linux.   Much of this I would consider 'new development' expanding XIVE support for Power VM.   If you think it should still have a fixes-tag, I will add it.

I think this is the right commit, please add it.

Could you also add your self as a Reviewer ?

Thanks,

C.
