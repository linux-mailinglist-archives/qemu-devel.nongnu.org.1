No, they always belong to zimop unless they are assigned to other 
extensions. Applications built with zicfiss can also
run on cpu with zimop. In this case, the instructions of zicfiss should 
be disassemble as zimop maybe-ops which has it's default behavior 
different with the behavior of zicfiss.

  Zimop belongs to mandate extension in RVB23 profile. There may be a 
lot of cpus implement zimop but doesn't implement overlapping zicfiss.  
So disassemble the applications to zimop is appropriate for these cpus.

Yes.

Agree. Will use this way.
