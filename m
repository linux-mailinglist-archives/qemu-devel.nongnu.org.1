My feeling as well.

The string visitors have long been a thorn in my side.

Makes sense. On the other hand, from the C point of view I admit that
passing a Visitor* or a QObject* to the setter would not be very
different=E2=80=94or possibly even a bit more code for the QObject*. Likewi=
se for
passing a QObject** on the getter side.

So the problem isn't the flexibility... It's using/exploiting it.

Yes.

The simplest such converters convert via QObject.  Grossly inefficient

Exactly. What keeps me on the edge is that for QMP the result is still a
bit less efficient than straight QObject->Rust via Serde. For the QOM
property Visitor->C->Rust is better than Visitor->QObject->Rust, but is it
worth the extra amount of code generator? Leaving the code generation
business to Serde is appealing and it gets one of the two (QMP) as
efficient as it can be.

The Serde interface code is pretty much write once and forget, since
QObject hasn't changed substantially in 15 years. The qapi-gen code is
write once but stays more in the way of other Python code we maintain. On
the other hand the Serde code is probably going to be a bit on the
impenetrable side, and until someone writes it we don't know if the balance
may tilt back towards preferring Marc-Andr=C3=A9's ideas.
