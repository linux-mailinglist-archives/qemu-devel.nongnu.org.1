I thought it should, but I suppose it shouldn't given that you have
been relying on None to cause a crash.

Here's where that pattern *would* be used if None was legitimate:

qapi/schema.py:604: error: Item "None" of
"Optional[List[QAPISchemaObjectTypeMember]]" has no attribute
"__iter__" (not iterable)  [union-attr]
qapi/schema.py:626: error: Item "None" of
"Optional[List[QAPISchemaObjectTypeMember]]" has no attribute
"__iter__" (not iterable)  [union-attr]
qapi/gen.py:122: error: Item "None" of
"Optional[List[QAPISchemaObjectTypeMember]]" has no attribute
"__iter__" (not iterable)  [union-attr]
qapi/commands.py:68: error: Item "None" of
"Optional[List[QAPISchemaObjectTypeMember]]" has no attribute
"__iter__" (not iterable)  [union-attr]
qapi/events.py:60: error: Item "None" of
"Optional[List[QAPISchemaObjectTypeMember]]" has no attribute
"__iter__" (not iterable)  [union-attr]

but, I suppose your argument is that it just literally never is. So
never mind the callsite argument - though mypy still wants its
guarantee that it will never be None here.

Mmm, I see. (I very often just literally don't account for you relying
on invalid types being load-bearing ... Seeing a stack trace where
you're told that "None" does not have such-and-such property usually
feels about as helpful as getting kicked out of a moving car on the
freeway.)

Didn't occur to me to add a crash on purpose... In the other cases, I
think I didn't have any suitable value to add at all, but in this case
I can use an empty list.

(I have a kind of distaste for relying on Python-level exceptions like
AttributeError to indicate that a stateful error has occurred - i.e.
that this attribute doesn't exist yet, but it will. I usually aim for
having all of the attributes defined at initialization time. The error
is misleading, semantically.

In our case, full initialization directly at init time is not ...
quite possible without some vigorous reworking of the known universe,
so I capitulated and allowed some "very late initialization" which
causes some friction for static typing between pre- and post- "delayed
initialization" callsites. It's still very much something I look at
and regard as a code smell. The entire point of declaring all state in
the init method is to centralize that state so it's finite and
knowable, both to static analysis tools and to humans. Punting the
initialization to arbitrary points later in the object's lifetime
feels like lying: we promise this value is here after initialization,
except not really, have a nice day.)

*cough* that said, I can also use that same trick here. I just want to
whine about it. (I guess I don't want to teach folks what I consider
to be a bad habit just because it makes the linters shut up, but
realize the sausage has to get made.)

... I *just* now saw you had more ideas on how to approach this in the
last series, I will go back and read them. I didn't mean to skip past
them. Lemme investigate.

Ah, oops.

(I wish mypy would bark about this, actually: if members is a List,
then surely it can't ever be None, right? It's definitely a smell. I
wonder if there is a reason why it doesn't, or if this is a valid
feature request.)
