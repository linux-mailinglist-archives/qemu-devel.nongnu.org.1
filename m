Valid point.

The "raw" format's slicing feature has dangerous sharp edges.

I'm all for with giving users poweful tools, even if they're dangerous.
However, as we can see here, this one can interact badly with the
implicit use of "raw".  Adding the slicing feature to "raw" may have
been a mistake, and naming one of its configuration options "size"
definitely was a mistake.  Something like @slice-offset and @slize-size
would've been safer.

Anyway, the interface is set in stone now.

Better.  It's the size of the image, though, not the size of the
filesystem.  They are the same only if there's no MBR.
