I don't know about showstoppers, but:

1. As far as I'm aware there are/were problems with the virtual IOMMU
devices in HVF. It's been a while (~half a year?) since I tried them, but I
had problems getting guests booted with intel_iommu etc.

2. I think there might also be a few remaining edge cases where the x86
instruction emulation on fault/trap is incomplete. Most notably, MMIO using
SSE/AVX/etc. instructions will, I think, fail. In practice this is a fairly
obscure use case - I'm not aware of any guest OS that actually performs
MMIO using these instructions. I have a patch kicking around that adds
support for missing 64-bit variants of common scalar arithmetic
instructions with memory operands. I can dig that up and post it - do we
have a good way of adding tests for this kind of thing?

3. As far as I'm aware, there's no CI happening on HVF? Or has that
changed? macOS is notoriously a pain in the rear in terms of CI thanks to
its licensing, and the big cloud CI platforms tend to run it in a VM which
in turn typically doesn't support nested HVF. I've been working on an
on-prem solution to provisioning bare-metal Macs to run clean-slate OS
images for CI. This has been a side project though and I haven't had the
resources to focus on that project to see it through. It might be possible
to do this in the cloud on Amazon's EC2 Mac Minis as well, but those aren't
exactly cheap.
