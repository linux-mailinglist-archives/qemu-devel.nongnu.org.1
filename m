Hmm, actually it doesn't. Your firmware just needs to _also_ implement
it. So your OS kernel could test whether or not the misaligned access
performance is beans and then choose to emulate misaligned access
itself. Not ideal, but better than I thought.

Correct.

Yeah, that's effectively what we have to do. I started doing that for
zifencei/zicsr in Linux and it should be done for anything else like
this going forwards.

No they can't. For a "regular extension" you populate the DT with the
extension. For these extensions it has to put negated properties in the
DT, otherwise it is incorrectly describing the hardware it is emulating.
That is handling them differently in my book! If QEMU generates an
incorrect DT representation of the hardware it is emulating, that's a
QEMU bug.

Software should be able to trust that the DT describes the system
correctly. I can only speak for Linux here, but validating the DT is not
the job of the running kernel - it should be a correct description.

That's helpful sure, but it doesn't absolve QEMU of having to correctly
generate a DT.
