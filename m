Ya, I agree.  That's part of the reason why I wasn't sure if it's a 
good idea.  At least for this one I think there should be some easy to 
understand performance issue, as the loops that go very slowly consist 
of a small number of instructions and go a lot slower.

I'm actually more worried about this running into a rabbit hole of 
adding new TCG operations or even just having no well defined mappings 
between RVV and AVX, those might make the project really hard.

I can at least dig up some of the examples I ran into, there's been a 
handful filtering in over the last year or so.

This one 
<https://gist.github.com/compnerd/daa7e68f7b4910cb6b27f856e6c2beba> 
still has a much more than 10x slowdown (73ms -> 13s) with 
vectorization, for example.
