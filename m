A slot is a "contact" in the screen (usually a finger), and should
remain the same for the events generated from that contact until it's
raised from the screen. That is, for a two-fingers pinch gesture, all
the events coming from one finger should have slot =3D=3D X, and the ones
coming from the other finger should slot =3D=3D Y, where X and Y never
change during the gesture.

In compositors where slot =3D=3D sequence, we get exactly this behavior. On
compositors where sequence is always increasing, assuming it's kept the
same for the duration of a contact, the modulo option can do the trick
just fine, as long we don't need to support more than 10 contact points
(which seems unlikely to me).

Sergio.
